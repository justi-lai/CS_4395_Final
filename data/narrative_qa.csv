The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red.\nTo restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. But one night Moore is violently murdered in the office and Capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend\'s death.\nMoore would gather his patients every Monday for a discussion of their problems. Police detective Lt. Hector Martinez (Blades) considers them, and possibly Capa, suspects in the murder. Capa continues to live in Moore\'s house and begins an affair with Rose (March), a mysterious girl who comes and goes. He takes over Moore\'s therapy group and learns of their pasts and obsessions:\nClark (Brad Dourif) suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things. He also has a violent temper, and months earlier beat up his wife.\nSondra (Lesley Ann Warren) is a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac. She stabbed her father with a knife and fork and her husband died of unnatural causes.\nBuck (Lance Henriksen) is a suicidal ex-cop. The murder of his wife and daughter remains unsolved.\nCasey (Kevin J. O\'Connor), the arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art. He once burned down his father\'s house.\nRichie is a transgender 16-year-old who wishes to transition to female. Richie also has social anxiety disorder, a stutter and a history of drug use.\nOne of these patients is violently murdered. Capa also becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose.\nThis leads to a twist ending: ""Richie"" is really Rose, and the murders have been committed by her deranged brother Dale (Andrew Lowery). They once had an actual brother named Richie who was molested by a child psychiatrist named Niedelmeyer. Richie committed suicide and, unable to cope with the loss, Dale forced Rose to play the part of their brother. Dale â\x80\x94 who was also one of Niedelmeyer\'s victims â\x80\x94 began abusing Rose until she actually became ""Richie"". When ""Richie"" was arrested for drug possession, ""he"" was forced into therapy. Rose soon started to re-emerge and, under another personality, ""Bonnie"", started relationships with other members of the group. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to ""Richie"".\nCapa confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Capa is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts â\x80\x94 one at the beginning, resulting in Capa\'s loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.', 'tokens': array(['Dr.', 'Bill', 'Capa', '(', 'Willis', ')', ',', 'a', 'New', 'York',

He sits behind his\n          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange\n          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer\n          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his\n          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and\n          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes\n          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels\n          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.\n                         \n<b>          BOB\'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\n</b>                         \n          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He\n          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that\n          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.\n          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his\n          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was\n          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves\n          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,\n          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through\n          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.\n                         \n<b>                          BOB\n</b>           Barbara ?...\n                         \n          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the\n          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We\n          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the\n          glass on the door.\n                         \n<b>          BOB\'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n</b>                         \n          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely\n          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass\n          paneI, and jumps on Bob\'s back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets\n          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and\n          falls down.\n           Close-up of the mysterious man\'s hand. It is covered with a\n          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top\n          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers\n          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of\n          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He\n          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns\n          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles\n          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by\n          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.\n                         \n<b>                          BOB\n</b>           No... Nooooo !... Why ?\n                         \n          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He\n          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his\n          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his\n          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over\n          Los Angeles.\n<b>          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n</b>                         \n          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue\n          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter\n          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at\n          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the\n          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a\n          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.\n          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away.

Let me know, okay ?\n                         \n          A click ends the message. During Bill\'s message, the tracking shot\n          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney\'s Pluto\'s head\n          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to\n          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting\n          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman\n          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another\n          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of\n          Bill\'s message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a\n          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where\n          a dumbbell is resting.\n                         \n<b>                          CASEY\n</b>           I think I want to continue.\n          We hear the crack of a whip.

Medium long shot on the room.\n           Oh!

His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly\n          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when\n          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back\n          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled\n          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,\n          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its\n          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated\n          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in\n          the box, doesn\'t seem to know what it must do next.\n           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked\n          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely\n          avoid driving on Bill.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>          Yelling to the driver.\n           Hey !\n                         \n          The car honks.

Hey !... Help !... Shit !\n          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He\n          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.\n           Fuck !\n          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.\n           Hello !\n          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall\n          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the\n          road.\n           I am not goin\' back to New York, you hear me ? You\'re stuck\n           with me !\n          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks\n          at the envelopes.\n           Fuckin\' bill. Great.\n                         \n          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the\n          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter\n          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face\n          Hector.\n                         \n<b>                          HECTOR\n</b>           Capa !\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>          He comes back to the car.

Bill turns Rose around to put her lying\n          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very\n          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.\n           They both moan.

Bill has been listening to her outburst without\n          reacting.\n           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra\'s expression changes\n          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.\n           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.\n           Wow ! That\'s my trainer.\n          She gets up and sniffs a bit.\n           I gotta go.

The building could be an old factory\n          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very\n          high chimney above the building.\n           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the\n          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that\n          indicates the location of the «office». He knocks at a door with a\n          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog». The\n          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through\n          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.\n           Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office». He stops in\n          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He\n          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick\n          glimpse of someone behind the window.\n           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men\n          are unloading.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>           Hey!

He\n          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and\n          gets in.\n           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.\n          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted «office»)\n          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to\n          watch Bill.\n           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.\n          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.\n           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are\n          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,\n          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>           Excuse me.\n                         \n          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding.

Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her\n          shopping items are scattered on the pavement.

The\n          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on\n          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.\n          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and\n          causes a pile-up on the road.\n           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a\n          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.\n          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then\n          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and\n          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the\n          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.\n           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?\n          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and\n          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.\n           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car\n          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.\n           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.\n          We see the train moving behind him.\n                         \n<b>          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n</b>                         \n          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular.

He switches off the car\n          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket\n          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck\'s house. He goes\n          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill\n          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops\n          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters\n          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after\n          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns\n          around.

He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill\n          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan\n          rug. Bill dries his face.

Both his hands are\n          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged.

He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He\n          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of\n          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it.

He jumps down in a sort\n          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern\n          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a\n          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow\'s snout,\n          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of\n          the yard. He notices he is above Casey\'s workshop.

He takes\n          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He\n          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.\n           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are\n          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put\n          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and\n          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.\n           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,\n          flooding the room with bright light.\n           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings\n          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair\n          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the\n          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought\n          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from\n          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a\n          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.\n           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on\n          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this\n          slimy liquid.\n           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable\n          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the\n          same cable, comes Casey\'s body, hanging upside down. He looks dead\n          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is\n          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey\'s\n          blood.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>           Ow ! Ow ! Ow !

He has just understood the\n          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a\n          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling\n          its tongue out.\n                         \n<b>          DALE\'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n</b>                         \n          Bob\'s car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale\'s\n          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than\n          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly\n          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the\n          first floor of the building.\n           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car\n          and runs toward the building.

He bumps into a small\n          cage hanging from the ceiling.\n           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with\n          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It\'s blood. Bill\n          raises his head.\n           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.\n           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood\n          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the\n          workshop.\n           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the\n          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously.

We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on\n          the controls of a handling machine.\n           Bill moves Rose away from him...\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>           Let\'s go!\n                         \n          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls\n          down, stuck under the furniture.\n                         \n<b>                          ROSE\n</b>           No ! Get out !\n                         \n          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his\n          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the\n          belt across the workshop.\n                         \n<b>                          DALE\n</b>           Come on ! Come on !\n                         \n          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of\n          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from\n          his throat.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>           You fucking son of a bitch !\n          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on\n          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.\n           You really fucked it up, didn\'t ya ?

We\n          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale\'s\n          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,\n          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.\n                         \n<b>                          DALE\n</b>           Richie.\n                         \n<b>                          ROSE\n</b>           My name is...

No !\n          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to\n          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn\'t work. She\n          tries again. It still doesn\'t work. The gun must be empty.\n           No !\n          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has\n          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.\n           No !\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n</b>          He runs after her.\n           Rose !

His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose\'s arm\n          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he\n          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They\n          eventually reach the chimney ladder.

Bill looks at the beacon on the\n          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is\n          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even\n          more tightly.\n                         \n<b>                          HECTOR\'S VOICE\n</b>          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole\n          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector\'s\n          voice.\n           Hey!

THE END', 'summary': {'text': ' Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore) and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu) are the ""Angels"", three intelligent, talented, tough, attractive women who work as private investigators together for an unseen millionaire named Charlie (voiced by John Forsythe). Charlie uses a speaker in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant Bosley (Bill Murray) works with them directly when needed.\nCharlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot the Creepy Thin Man (Crispin Glover) who was seen on the surveillance videos during Knox\'s kidnapping. They chase and fight the Creepy Thin Man, but he runs away. When they follow him, they discover Knox.\nAfter the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Creepy Thin Man has stolen Knox\'s voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox\'s offer to spend the night with him, end up in making love but he betrays her later that night, explaining that he faked the kidnapping with help from Vivian and the Creepy Thin Man. He has kidnapped Bosley, and, with access to Redstar\'s central computer, he intends to use his voice software with the Redstar satellite network to find and kill Charlie, who he believes had killed his father in the Vietnam War.\nKnox shoots at Dylan, seemingly killing her, but she escapes unharmed. Natalie and Alex are also attacked, and Corwin is murdered by the Creepy Thin Man. When the Angels regroup together, all uninjured, Charlie\'s offices are blown up. A radio receiver survives in the rubble, and Natalie deduces Bosley\'s location as he speaks to the Angels using a radio transmitter implanted in his teeth, explaining how to spot his location where he is being held captive.\nWith help from Dylan\'s current boyfriend The Chad (Tom Green), the Angels approach the abandoned lighthouse where Knox is holding Bosley prisoner. The Angels rescue Bosley and defeat Vivian, the Creepy Thin Man, and some henchmen before Knox blows up the lighthouse, but Knox uses his software and the Redstar satellite network to locate Charlie when he telephones Bosley. When Knox programs a helicopter with a missile towards Charlie\'s house, Bosley helps the Angels board the helicopter, and Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards, which blows up the helicopter and kills Knox while all of the Angels land safely together on the beach.\nSeeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the beach house that Knox had targeted the missile at, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation.

It\'s the regular\nmix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying\nfreshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-\nshirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...\n\n...a very nervous MAN.\n\nShifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.\nWe hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then\nwe continue moving into --\n\n<b>THE COACH SECTION\n</b>\nStopping at the lavatory, the ""OCCUPIED"" sign switches to\n""VACANT"" and...\n\n<b>JAMES EARL JONES\n</b>\n(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of\ndescription, we\'ll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)\nsteps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:\nmulti-colored dashiki, mufti (it\'s a kind of hat), the\nworks. He heads up the aisle towards --\n\n<b>THE FIRST CLASS CABIN\n</b>\nWhere he is stopped by a --\n\n<b>                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n</b>           I\'m sorry, sir.

As he passes:\n\n<b>                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n</b>           Oh, I\'m sorry. Please. Is there\n           anything I can get you?\n\n<b>                         JAMES EARL JONES\n</b>           Scotch, blended. Straight.\n\nHe continues into the first class cabin and toward --\n<b>\n</b><b>CHARLIE\'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2.\n</b>\n<b>THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM\n</b>\nWhere he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his\nname is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.\n\nAfter a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and\nleans, slightly, towards Jones.\n\n<b>                        PASQUAL\n</b>                 (tentatively)\n          They say birds can\'t fly this high.\n\n<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES\n</b>          They say only angels can.\n\nNow Pasqual nods.

Thank you.\n\nShe hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off\nthe glass. She shrugs, leaving...\n\nPasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes\na roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- ""Well? What about\nyour end of the bargain?""\n\nFrom within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet\npouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find\ndiamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.\n\nHe hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It\'s not breath\ncandy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,\nhigh-tech triggering mechanism.\n\n<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES\n</b>          Ah, c-5.

A millionaire who died some years previously had provided in his will for the payment of $175,000,000 to the first person to stand at the North Pole.\nBefore Jeffson leaves, he hears a sermon by a Scottish priest, named Mackay, speaking against Polar research, calling the failure of all previous expeditions the will of God, and prophesying a terrible fate for those who attempt to go against God\'s will. Jeffson at the same time remembers his meeting with a man who claimed that the universe is a place of strife between vague ""powers"", ""The White"" and ""The Black"", for dominance.\nThroughout the events of the polar journey, Jeffson gradually discovers that his course has been, for many years, guided by these forces, all the way up to the point when he reaches the pole. He finds a huge clear lake of spinning water, with a rocky island inlaid with inscriptions. Upon seeing this, Jeffson suddenly faints. When he returns to his camp he, along with his dogs, feels nauseated after having smelled a peculiar peach-like odour. He also notices a moving purple cloud, spreading in the far heavens. During the progress of his journey, he discovers dead animals, all without the slightest sign of injury, and he gradually learns of the death of his entire crew on board the Boreal.\nThe ship being fairly easy to operate, he sets out by himself. First he travels towards northern islands, but upon seeing the death of all various races from around the world there (the result of an exodus, escaping the death-bringing cloud), and meeting ships crowded with corpses, he comes instead to the dead continent, walking through London, searching for news of the cloud. He looks for any survivors in shut mines, but finds all barricades broken through by mad crowds. Later, he goes to the house of Arthur Machen (an actual close friend of Shiel\'s), whom he finds dead, having been writing a poem until the very end. There, he finds the notebook into which he writes his whole narrative.\nThe later parts of the book describe Jeffson\'s descent into mad pompousness: adopting Turkish attire, he declares himself monarch and burns down cities (including Paris, Bordeaux, London, and San Francisco) for pleasure. He then commits his life to one task, the construction of a huge and colossal golden palace on the isle of Imbros, which he means to dedicate as an altar to God and a palace to himself. He spends seventeen years on the palace, several times abandoning the work, until its completion, when he recognizes the vanity of it.\nWhile travelling through Constantinople, which he also burns down, he meets a twenty-year-old naked woman who is without the slightest knowledge of anything in the world. She continues to follow him, no matter how he mistreats her. Gradually, he accepts her, but forces her to wear a veil over her mouth. Her speed at learning astonishes him, so he teaches her to speak, read, cook, fish, and dress.\nThe girl (who is unable to pronounce ""r"", instead saying ""l"") reveals that she had lived her whole life in a cellar below the royal palace of Turkey, and that she knew nothing of the world until she was freed when Jeffson burned down Constantinople. She becomes absorbed in the Bible and declares the humans who sought for riches as ""spoiled"".\nJeffson struggles mightily against his growing affection towards the girl, wishing to end the human race. At the very end, when he leaves to go to England, she telephones him about the re-appearance of the Purple Cloud over France. He rushes to her, embracing her as his wife and now hoping to find a way to escape the cloud. She tells him to trust that God will not allow her to die. He concludes his writing by saying that he has accepted his role and that after three weeks have passed no purple cloud has appeared, and he looks forward to the two of them becoming the progenitors of future humanity.', 'tokens': array(['The', 'story', ',', 'a', 'recording', 'of', 'a', 'medium', 's',

They came from a very good friend of mine, whose name there is\nno reason that I should now conceal--Dr. Arthur Lister Browne, M.A.\n(Oxon.), F.R.C.P. It happened that for two years I had been spending\nmost of my time in France, and as Browne had a Norfolk practice, I had\nnot seen him during my visits to London. Moreover, though our friendship\nwas of the most intimate kind, we were both atrocious correspondents: so\nthat only two notes passed between us during those years.\n\nTill, last May, there reached me the letter--and the packet--to which I\nrefer. The packet consisted of four note-books, quite crowded\nthroughout with those giddy shapes of Pitman\'s shorthand, whose\n_ensemble_ so resembles startled swarms hovering in flighty poses on the\nwing. They were scribbled in pencil, with little distinction between\nthick and thin strokes, few vowels: so that their slow deciphering, I\ncan assure the reader, has been no holiday. The letter also was\npencilled in shorthand; and this letter, together with the second of the\nnote-books which I have deciphered (it was marked \'III.\'), I now\npublish.\n\n[I must say, however, that in some five instances there will occur\nsentences rather crutched by my own guess-work; and in two instances the\ncharacters were so impossibly mystical, that I had to abandon the\npassage with a head-ache. But all this will be found immaterial to the\ngeneral narrative.]\n\nThe following is Browne\'s letter:\n\n\'DEAR OLD SHIEL,--I have just been lying thinking of you, and wishing\nthat you were here to give one a last squeeze of the hand before\nI--""_go_"": for, by all appearance, ""going"" I am. Four days ago, I began\nto feel a soreness in the throat, and passing by old Johnson\'s surgery\nat Selbridge, went in and asked him to have a look at me. He muttered\nsomething about membranous laryngitis which made me smile, but by the\ntime I reached home I was hoarse, and not smiling: before night I had\ndyspnoca and laryngeal stridor. I at once telegraphed to London for\nMorgan, and, between him and Johnson, they have been opening my trachea,\nand burning my inside with chromic acid and the galvanic cautery. The\ndifficulty as to breathing has subsided, and it is wonderful how little\nI suffer: but I am much too old a hand not to know what\'s what: the\nbronchi are involved--_too far_ involved--and as a matter of absolute\nfact, there isn\'t any hope. Morgan is still, I believe, fondly dwelling\nupon the possibility of adding me to his successful-tracheotomy\nstatistics, but prognosis was always my strong point, and I say No. The\nvery small consolation of my death will be the beating of a specialist\nin his own line. So we shall see.\n\n\'I have been arranging some of my affairs this morning, and remembered\nthese notebooks. I intended letting you have them months ago, but my\nhabit of putting things off, and the fact that the lady was alive from\nwhom I took down the words, prevented me. Now she is dead, and as a\nliterary man, and a student of life, you should be interested, if you\ncan manage to read them. You may even find them valuable.\n\n\'I am under a little morphia at present, propped up in a nice little\nstate of languor, and as I am able to write without much effort, I will\ntell you in the old Pitman\'s something about her. Her name was Miss Mary\nWilson; she was about thirty when I met her, forty-five when she died,\nand I knew her intimately all those fifteen years. Do you know anything\nabout the philosophy of the hypnotic trance? Well, that was the relation\nbetween us--hypnotist and subject. She had been under another man before\nmy time, but no one was ever so successful with her as I. She suffered\nfrom _tic douloureux_ of the fifth nerve. She had had most of her teeth\ndrawn before I saw her, and an attempt had been made to wrench out the\nnerve on the left side by the external scission. But it made no\ndifference: all the clocks in hell tick-tacked in that poor woman\'s jaw,\nand it was the mercy of Providence that ever she came across _me_. My\norganisation was found to have almost complete, and quite easy, control\nover hers, and with a few passes I could expel her Legion.\n\n\'Well, you never saw anyone so singular in personal appearance as my\nfriend, Miss Wilson. Medicine-man as I am, I could never behold her\nsuddenly without a sensation of shock: she suggested so inevitably what\nwe call ""the _other_ world,"" one detecting about her some odour of the\nworm, with the feeling that here was rather ghost than woman. And yet I\ncan hardly convey to you the why of this, except by dry details as to\nthe contours of her lofty brow, meagre lips, pointed chin, and ashen\ncheeks. She was tall and deplorably emaciated, her whole skeleton,\nexcept the thigh-bones, being quite visible. Her eyes were of the bluish\nhue of cigarette smoke, and had in them the strangest, feeble, unearthly\ngaze; while at thirty-five her paltry wisp of hair was quite white.\n\n\'She was well-to-do, and lived alone in old Wooding Manor-house, five\nmiles from Ash Thomas. As you know, I was ""beginning"" in these parts at\nthe time, and soon took up my residence at the manor. She insisted that\nI should devote myself to her alone; and that one patient constituted\nthe most lucrative practice which I ever had.\n\n\'Well, I quickly found that, in the state of trance, Miss Wilson\npossessed very remarkable powers: remarkable, I mean, not, of course,\nbecause peculiar to herself in _kind_, but because they were so\nconstant, reliable, exact, and far-reaching, in degree. The veriest\nfledgling in psychical science will now sit and discourse finically to\nyou about the reporting powers of the mind in its trance state--just as\nthough it was something quite new! This simple fact, I assure you, which\nthe Psychical Research Society, only after endless investigation, admits\nto be scientific, has been perfectly well known to every old crone since\nthe Middle Ages, and, I assume, long previously. What an unnecessary air\nof discovery! The certainty that someone in trance in Manchester can\ntell you what is going on in London, or in Pekin, was not, of course,\nleft to the acumen of an office in Fleet Street; and the society, in\nestablishing the fact beyond doubt for the general public, has not gone\none step toward explaining it. They have, in fact, revealed nothing that\nmany of us did not, with absolute assurance, know before.\n\n\'But talking of poor Miss Wilson, I say that her powers were\n_remarkable_, because, though not exceptional in _genre_, they were so\nspecial in quantity,--so ""constant,"" and ""far-reaching."" I believe it to\nbe a fact that, _in general_, the powers of trance manifest themselves\nmore particularly with regard to space, as distinct from time: the\nspirit roams in the present--it travels over a plain--it does not\n_usually_ attract the interest of observers by great ascents, or by\ngreat descents. I fancy that is so. But Miss Wilson\'s gift was special\nto this extent, that she travelled in every direction, and easily in all\nbut one, north and south, up and down, in the past, the present, and the\nfuture.\n\nThis I discovered, not at once, but gradually. She would emit a stream\nof sounds in the trance state--I can hardly call it _speech_, so\nmurmurous, yet guttural, was the utterance, mixed with puffy\nbreath-sounds at the languid lips. This state was accompanied by an\nintense contraction of the pupils, absence of the knee-jerk,\nconsiderable rigor, and a rapt and arrant expression. I got into the\nhabit of sitting long hours at her bed-side, quite fascinated by her,\ntrying to catch the import of that opiate and visionary language which\ncame puffing and fluttering in deliberate monotone from her lips.\nGradually, in the course of months, my ear learned to detect the words;\n""the veil was rent"" for me also; and I was able to follow somewhat the\ncourse of her musing and wandering spirit.\n\nAt the end of six months I heard her one day repeat some words which\nwere familiar to me. They were these: ""Such were the arts by which the\nRomans extended their conquests, and attained the palm of victory; and\nthe concurring testimony of different authors enables us to describe\nthem with precision..."" I was startled: they are part of Gibbon\'s\n""Decline and Fall,"" which I easily guessed that she had never read.\n\nI said in a stern voice: ""Where are you?""\n\nShe replied, ""Us are in a room, eight hundred and eleven miles above. A\nman is writing. Us are reading.""\n\nI may tell you two things: first, that in trance she never spoke of\nherself as ""I,"" nor even as ""we,"" but, for some unknown reason, in the\n_objective_ way, as ""_us_"": ""us are,"" she would say--""us will,"" ""us\nwent""; though, of course, she was an educated lady, and I don\'t think\never lived in the West of England, where they say ""us"" in that way;\nsecondly, when wandering in the past, she always represented herself as\nbeing ""_above_"" (the earth?), and higher the further back in time she\nwent; in describing present events she appears to have felt herself _on_\n(the earth); while, as regards the future, she invariably declared that\n""_us_"" were so many miles ""within"" (the earth).\n\nTo her excursions in this last direction, however, there seemed to exist\ncertain fixed limits: I say seemed, for I cannot be sure, and only mean\nthat, in spite of my efforts, she never, in fact, went far in this\ndirection. Three, four thousand ""miles"" were common figures on her lips\nin describing her distance ""above""; but her distance ""within"" never got\nbeyond sixty-three. Usually, she would say twenty, twenty-five. She\nappeared, in relation to the future, to resemble a diver in the deep\nsea, who, the deeper he strives, finds a more resistant pressure, till,\nat no great depth, resistance becomes prohibition, and he can no further\nstrive.\n\n\'I am afraid I can\'t go on: though I had a good deal to tell you about\nthis lady. During fifteen years, off and on, I sat listening by her dim\nbed-side to her murmuring trances! At last my expert ear could detect\nthe sense of her faintest sigh. I heard the ""Decline and Fall"" from\nbeginning to end. Some of her reports were the most frivolous nonsense:\nover others I have hung in a horror of interest. Certainly, my friend, I\nhave heard some amazing words proceed from those wan lips of Mary\nWilson. Sometimes I could hitch her repeatedly to any scene or subject\nthat I chose by the mere exercise of my will; at others, the flighty\nwaywardness of her spirit eluded and baffled me: she resisted--she\ndisobeyed: otherwise I might have sent you, not four note-books, but\ntwenty, or forty. About the fifth year it struck me that it would be\nwell to jot down her more connected utterances, since I knew shorthand.\n\nThe note-book marked ""I.,"" [1] which seems to me the most curious,\nbelongs to the seventh year. Its history, like those of the other three,\nis this: I heard her one afternoon murmuring in the intonation used when\n_reading_; the matter interested me; I asked her where she was. She\nreplied: ""Us are forty-five miles within: us read, and another writes"";\nfrom which I concluded that she was some fifteen to thirty years in the\nfuture, perusing an as yet unpublished work. After that, during some\nweeks, I managed to keep her to the same subject, and finally, I fancy,\nwon pretty well the whole work. I believe you would find it striking,\nand hope you will be able to read my notes.\n\n\'But no more of Mary Wilson now. Rather let us think a little of A.L.\nBrowne, F.R.C.P.!--with a breathing-tube in his trachea, and Eternity\nunder his pillow...\' [Dr. Browne\'s letter then continues on a subject of\nno interest here.]\n\n[The present writer may add that Dr. Browne\'s prognosis of his own case\nproved correct, for he passed away two days after writing the above. My\ntranscription of the shorthand book marked \'III.\' I now proceed to give\nwithout comment, merely reminding the reader that the words form the\nsubstance of a book or document to be written, or to be motived\n(according to Miss Wilson) in that Future, which, no less than the Past,\nsubstantively exists in the Present--though, like the Past, we see it\nnot. I need only add that the title, division into paragraphs, &c., have\nbeen arbitrarily contrived by myself for the sake of form and\nconvenience.]\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This I intend to publish under the title of \'The Last\nMiracle; \'II.\' will bear that of \'The Lord of the Sea\'; the present book\nis marked \'III.\' The perusal of \'IV.\' I have yet finished, but so far do\nnot consider it suitable for publication.]\n\n\n\n\n(_Here begins the note-book marked \'III.\'_)\n\n\n\n\nTHE PURPLE CLOUD\n\n\nWell, the memory seems to be getting rather impaired now, rather weak.\nWhat, for instance, was the name of that parson who preached, just\nbefore the _Boreal_ set out, about the wickedness of any further attempt\nto reach the North Pole? I have forgotten! Yet four years ago it was\nfamiliar to me as my own name.\n\nThings which took place before the voyage seem to be getting a little\ncloudy in the memory now. I have sat here, in the loggia of this Cornish\nvilla, to write down some sort of account of what has happened--God\nknows why, since no eye can ever read it--and at the very beginning I\ncannot remember the parson\'s name.\n\nHe was a strange sort of man surely, a Scotchman from Ayrshire, big and\ngaunt, with tawny hair. He used to go about London streets in shough\nand rough-spun clothes, a plaid flung from one shoulder. Once I saw him\nin Holborn with his rather wild stalk, frowning and muttering to\nhimself. He had no sooner come to London, and opened chapel (I think in\nFetter Lane), than the little room began to be crowded; and when, some\nyears afterwards, he moved to a big establishment in Kensington, all\nsorts of men, even from America and Australia, flocked to hear the\nthunderstorms that he talked, though certainly it was not an age apt to\nfly into enthusiasms over that species of pulpit prophets and\nprophecies. But this particular man undoubtedly did wake the strong dark\nfeelings that sleep in the heart; his eyes were very singular and\npowerful; his voice from a whisper ran gathering, like snow-balls, and\ncrashed, as I have heard the pack-ice in commotion far yonder in the\nNorth; while his gestures were as uncouth and gawky as some wild man\'s\nof the primitive ages.\n\nWell, this man--what _was_ his name?--Macintosh? Mackay? I think--yes,\nthat was it! _Mackay_. Mackay saw fit to take offence at the new attempt\nto reach the Pole in the _Boreal_; and for three Sundays, when the\npreparations were nearing completion, stormed against it at Kensington.\n\nThe excitement of the world with regard to the North Pole had at this\ndate reached a pitch which can only be described as _fevered_, though\nthat word hardly expresses the strange ecstasy and unrest which\nprevailed: for the abstract interest which mankind, in mere desire for\nknowledge, had always felt in this unknown region, was now, suddenly, a\nthousand and a thousand times intensified by a new, concrete interest--a\ntremendous _money_ interest.\n\nAnd the new zeal had ceased to be healthy in its tone as the old zeal\nwas: for now the fierce demon Mammon was making his voice heard in this\nmatter.\n\nWithin the ten years preceding the _Boreal_ expedition, no less than\ntwenty-seven expeditions had set out, and failed.\n\nThe secret of this new rage lay in the last will and testament of Mr.\nCharles P. Stickney of Chicago, that king of faddists, supposed to be\nthe richest individual who ever lived: he, just ten years before the\n_Boreal_ undertaking, had died, bequeathing 175 million dollars to the\nman, of whatever nationality, who first reached the Pole.\n\nSuch was the actual wording of the will--_\'the man who first reached\'_:\nand from this loose method of designating the person intended had\nimmediately burst forth a prolonged heat of controversy in Europe and\nAmerica as to whether or no the testator meant _the Chief_ of the first\nexpedition which reached: but it was finally decided, on the highest\nlegal authority, that, in any case, the actual wording of the document\nheld good: and that it was the individual, whatever his station in the\nexpedition, whose foot first reached the 90th degree of north latitude,\nwho would have title to the fortune.\n\nAt all events, the public ferment had risen, as I say, to a pitch of\npositive fever; and as to the _Boreal_ in particular, the daily progress\nof her preparations was minutely discussed in the newspapers, everyone\nwas an authority on her fitting, and she was in every mouth a bet, a\nhope, a jest, or a sneer: for now, at last, it was felt that success was\nprobable. So this Mackay had an acutely interested audience, if a\nsomewhat startled, and a somewhat cynical, one.\n\nA truly lion-hearted man this must have been, after all, to dare\nproclaim a point-of-view so at variance with the spirit of his age! One\nagainst four hundred millions, they bent one way, he the opposite,\nsaying that they were wrong, all wrong! People used to call him \'John\nthe Baptist Redivivus\': and without doubt he did suggest something of\nthat sort. I suppose that at the time when he had the face to denounce\nthe _Boreal_ there was not a sovereign on any throne in Europe who, but\nfor shame, would have been glad of a subordinate post on board.\n\nOn the third Sunday night of his denunciation I was there in that\nKensington chapel, and I heard him. And the wild talk he talked! He\nseemed like a man delirious with inspiration.\n\nThe people sat quite spell-bound, while Mackay\'s prophesying voice\nranged up and down through all the modulations of thunder, from the\nhurrying mutter to the reverberant shock and climax: and those who came\nto scoff remained to wonder.\n\nPut simply, what he said was this: That there was undoubtedly some sort\nof Fate, or Doom, connected with the Poles of the earth in reference to\nthe human race: that man\'s continued failure, in spite of continual\nefforts, to reach them, abundantly and super-abundantly proved this; and\nthat this failure constituted a lesson--_and a warning_--which the race\ndisregarded at its peril.\n\nThe North Pole, he said, was not so very far away, and the difficulties\nin the way of reaching it were not, on the face of them, so very great:\nhuman ingenuity had achieved a thousand things a thousand times more\ndifficult; yet in spite of over half-a-dozen well-planned efforts in\nthe nineteenth century, and thirty-one in the twentieth, man had never\nreached: always he had been baulked, baulked, by some seeming\nchance--some restraining Hand: and herein lay the lesson--_herein the\nwarning_. Wonderfully--really _wonderfully_--like the Tree of\nKnowledge in Eden, he said, was that Pole: all the rest of earth lying\nopen and offered to man--but _That_ persistently veiled and \'forbidden.\'\nIt was as when a father lays a hand upon his son, with: \'Not here, my\nchild; wheresoever you will--but not here.\'\n\nBut human beings, he said, were free agents, with power to stop their\nears, and turn a callous consciousness to the whispers and warning\nindications of Heaven; and he believed, he said, that the time was now\ncome when man would find it absolutely in his power to stand on that\n90th of latitude, and plant an impious right foot on the head of the\nearth--just as it had been given into the absolute power of Adam to\nstretch an impious right hand, and pluck of the Fruit of Knowledge; but,\nsaid he--his voice pealing now into one long proclamation of awful\naugury--just as the abuse of that power had been followed in the one\ncase by catastrophe swift and universal, so, in the other, he warned the\nentire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a lowering\nsky, and thundery weather.\n\nThe man\'s frantic earnestness, authoritative voice, and savage gestures,\ncould not but have their effect upon all; as for me, I declare, I sat as\nthough a messenger from Heaven addressed me. But I believe that I had\nnot yet reached home, when the whole impression of the discourse had\npassed from me like water from a duck\'s back. The Prophet in the\ntwentieth century was not a success. John Baptist himself, camel-skin\nand all, would, have met with only tolerant shrugs. I dismissed Mackay\nfrom my mind with the thought: \'He is behind his age, I suppose.\'\n\nBut haven\'t I thought differently of Mackay since, my God...?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree weeks--it was about that--before that Sunday night discourse, I\nwas visited by Clark, the chief of the coming expedition--a mere visit\nof friendship. I had then been established about a year at No. II,\nHarley Street, and, though under twenty-five, had, I suppose, as _Ã©lite_\na practice as any doctor in Europe.\n\n_Ã\x89lite_--but small. I was able to maintain my state, and move among the\ngreat: but now and again I would feel the secret pinch of\nmoneylessness. Just about that time, in fact, I was only saved from\nconsiderable embarrassment by the success of my book, \'Applications of\nScience to the Arts.\'\n\nIn the course of conversation that afternoon, Clark said to me in his\nlight hap-hazard way:\n\n\'Do you know what I dreamed about you last night, Adam Jeffson? I\ndreamed that you were with us on the expedition.\'\n\nI think he must have seen my start: on the same night I had myself\ndreamed the same thing; but not a word said I about it now. There was a\nstammer in my tongue when I answered:\n\n\'Who? I?--on the expedition?--I would not go, if I were asked.\'\n\n\'Oh, you would.\'\n\n\'I wouldn\'t. You forget that I am about to be married.\'\n\n\'Well, we need not discuss the point, as Peters is not going to die,\'\nsaid he. \'Still, if anything did happen to him, you know, it is you I\nshould come straight to, Adam Jeffson.\'\n\n\'Clark, you jest,\' I said: \'I know really very little of astronomy, or\nmagnetic phenomena. Besides, I am about to be married....\'\n\n\'But what about your botany, my friend? _There\'s_ what we should be\nwanting from you: and as for nautical astronomy, poh, a man with your\nscientific habit would pick all that up in no time.\'\n\n\'You discuss the matter as gravely as though it were a possibility,\nClark,\' I said, smiling. \'Such a thought would never enter my head:\nthere is, first of all, my _fiancÃ©e_----\'\n\n\'Ah, the all-important Countess, eh?--Well, but she, as far as I know\nthe lady, would be the first to force you to go. The chance of stamping\none\'s foot on the North Pole does not occur to a man every day, my son.\'\n\n\'Do talk of something else!\' I said. \'There is Peters....\'\n\n\'Well, of course, there is Peters. But believe me, the dream I had was\nso clear----\'\n\n\'Let me alone with your dreams, and your Poles!\' I laughed.\n\nYes, I remember: I pretended to laugh loud! But my secret heart knew,\neven _then_, that one of those crises was occurring in my life which,\nfrom my youth, has made it the most extraordinary which any creature of\nearth ever lived. And I knew that this was so, firstly, because of the\ntwo dreams, and secondly, because, when Clark was gone, and I was\ndrawing on my gloves to go to see my _fiancÃ©e_, I heard distinctly the\nold two Voices talk within me: and One said: \'Go not to see her now!\'\nand the Other: \'Yes, go, go!\'\n\nThe two Voices of my life! An ordinary person reading my words would\nundoubtedly imagine that I mean only two ordinary contradictory\nimpulses--or else that I rave: for what modern man could comprehend how\nreal-seeming were those voices, how loud, and how, ever and again, I\nheard them contend within me, with a nearness \'nearer than breathing,\'\nas it says in the poem, and \'closer than hands and feet.\'\n\nAbout the age of seven it happened first to me. I was playing one summer\nevening in a pine-wood of my father\'s; half a mile away was a\nquarry-cliff; and as I played, it suddenly seemed as if someone said to\nme, inside of me: \'Just take a walk toward the cliff\'; and as if someone\nelse said: \'Don\'t go that way at all\'--mere whispers then, which\ngradually, as I grew up, seemed to swell into cries of wrathful\ncontention! I did go toward the cliff: it was steep, thirty feet high,\nand I fell. Some weeks later, on recovering speech, I told my astonished\nmother that \'someone had pushed me\' over the edge, and that someone else\n\'had caught me\' at the bottom!\n\nOne night, soon after my eleventh birthday, lying in bed, the thought\nstruck me that my life must be of great importance to some thing or\nthings which I could not see; that two Powers, which hated each other,\nmust be continually after me, one wishing for some reason to kill me,\nand the other for some reason to keep me alive, one wishing me to do so\nand so, and the other to do the opposite; that I was not a boy like\nother boys, but a creature separate, special, marked for--something.\nAlready I had notions, touches of mood, passing instincts, as occult and\nprimitive, I verily believe, as those of the first man that stepped; so\nthat such Biblical expressions as \'The Lord spake to So-and-so, saying\'\nhave hardly ever suggested any question in my mind as to how the Voice\nwas heard: I did not find it so very difficult to comprehend that\noriginally man had more ears than two; nor should have been surprised to\nknow that I, in these latter days, more or less resembled those primeval\nones.\n\nBut not a creature, except perhaps my mother, has ever dreamed me what I\nhere state that I was. I seemed the ordinary youth of my time, bow in my\n\'Varsity eight, cramming for exams., dawdling in clubs. When I had to\ndecide as to a profession, who could have suspected the conflict that\ntransacted itself in my soul, while my brain was indifferent to the\nmatter--that agony of strife with which the brawling voices shouted, the\none: \'Be a scientist--a doctor,\' and the other: \'Be a lawyer, an\nengineer, an artist--be _anything_ but a doctor!\'\n\nA doctor I became, and went to what had grown into the greatest of\nmedical schools--Cambridge; and there it was that I came across a man,\nnamed Scotland, who had a rather odd view of the world. He had rooms, I\nremember, in the New Court at Trinity, and a set of us were generally\nthere. He was always talking about certain \'Black\' and \'White Powers,\ntill it became absurd, and the men used to call him\n\'black-and-white-mystery-man,\' because, one day, when someone said\nsomething about \'the black mystery of the universe,\' Scotland\ninterrupted him with the words: \'the black-and-white mystery.\'\n\nQuite well I remember Scotland now--the sweetest, gentle soul he was,\nwith a passion for cats, and Sappho, and the Anthology, very short in\nstature, with a Roman nose, continually making the effort to keep his\nneck straight, and draw his paunch in. He used to say that the universe\nwas being frantically contended for by two Powers: a White and a Black;\nthat the White was the stronger, but did not find the conditions on our\nparticular planet very favourable to his success; that he had got the\nbest of it up to the Middle Ages in Europe, but since then had been\nslowly and stubbornly giving way before the Black; and that finally the\nBlack would win--not everywhere perhaps, but _here_--and would carry\noff, if no other earth, at least _this_ one, for his prize.\n\nThis was Scotland\'s doctrine, which he never tired of repeating; and\nwhile others heard him with mere toleration, little could they divine\nwith what agony of inward interest, I, cynically smiling there, drank in\nhis words. Most profound, most profound, was the impression they made\nupon me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I was saying that when Clark left me, I was drawing on my gloves to\ngo to see my _fiancÃ©e_, the Countess Clodagh, when I heard the two\nvoices most clearly.\n\nSometimes the urgency of one or other impulse is so overpowering, that\nthere is no resisting it: and it was so then with the one that bid me\ngo.\n\nI had to traverse the distance between Harley Street and Hanover Square,\nand all the time it was as though something shouted at my physical ear:\n\'Since you go, breathe no word of the _Boreal_, and Clark\'s visit\'; and\nanother shout: \'Tell, tell, hide nothing!\'\n\nIt seemed to last a month: yet it was only some minutes before I was in\nHanover Square, and Clodagh in my arms.\n\nShe was, in my opinion, the most superb of creatures, Clodagh--that\nhaughty neck which seemed always scorning something just behind her left\nshoulder. Superb! but ah--I know it now--a godless woman, Clodagh, a\nbitter heart.\n\nClodagh once confessed to me that her favourite character in history was\nLucrezia Borgia, and when she saw my horror, immediately added: \'Well,\nno, I am only joking!\' Such was her duplicity: for I see now that she\nlived in the constant effort to hide her heinous heart from me. Yet, now\nI think of it, how completely did Clodagh enthral me!\n\nOur proposed marriage was opposed by both my family and hers: by mine,\nbecause her father and grandfather had died in lunatic asylums; and by\nhers, because, forsooth, I was neither a rich nor a noble match. A\nsister of hers, much older than herself, had married a common country\ndoctor, Peters of Taunton, and this so-called _mÃ©salliance_ made the\nso-called _mÃ©salliance_ with me doubly detestable in the eyes of her\nrelatives. But Clodagh\'s extraordinary passion for me was to be stemmed\nneither by their threats nor prayers. What a flame, after all, was\nClodagh! Sometimes she frightened me.\n\nShe was at this date no longer young, being by five years my senior, as\nalso, by five years, the senior of her nephew, born from the marriage of\nher sister with Peters of Taunton. This nephew was Peter Peters, who was\nto accompany the _Boreal_ expedition as doctor, botanist, and\nmeteorological assistant.\n\nOn that day of Clark\'s visit to me I had not been seated five minutes\nwith Clodagh, when I said:\n\n\'Dr. Clark--ha! ha! ha!--has been talking to me about the Expedition. He\nsays that if anything happened to Peters, I should be the first man he\nwould run to. He has had an absurd dream...\'\n\nThe consciousness that filled me as I uttered these words was the\n_wickedness_ of me--the crooked wickedness. But I could no more help it\nthan I could fly.\n\nClodagh was standing at a window holding a rose at her face. For quite a\nminute she made no reply. I saw her sharp-cut, florid face in profile,\nsteadily bent and smelling. She said presently in her cold, rapid way:\n\n\'The man who first plants his foot on the North Pole will certainly be\nennobled. I say nothing of the many millions... I only wish that I was\na man!\'\n\n\'I don\'t know that I have any special ambition that way,\' I rejoined. \'I\nam very happy in my warm Eden with my Clodagh. I don\'t like the outer\nCold.\'\n\n\'Don\'t let me think little of you!\' she answered pettishly.\n\n\'Why should you, Clodagh? I am not bound to desire to go to the North\nPole, am I?\'\n\n\'But you _would_ go, I suppose, if you could?\'\n\n\'I might--I--doubt it. There is our marriage....\'\n\n\'Marriage indeed! It is the one thing to transform our marriage from a\nsneaking difficulty to a ten times triumphant event.\'\n\n\'You mean if _I_ personally were the first to stand at the Pole. But\nthere are many in an expedition. It is very unlikely that _I_,\npersonally--\'\n\n\'For _me_ you will, Adam--\' she began.\n\n\'""_Will_,"" Clodagh?\' I cried. \'You say ""_will_""? there is not even the\nslightest shadow of a probability--!\'\n\n\'But why? There are still three weeks before the start. They say...\'\n\nShe stopped, she stopped.\n\n\'They say what?\'\n\nHer voice dropped:\n\n\'That Peter takes atropine.\'\n\nAh, I started then. She moved from the window, sat in a rocking-chair,\nand turned the leaves of a book, without reading. We were silent, she\nand I; I standing, looking at her, she drawing the thumb across the\nleaf-edges, and beginning again, contemplatively. Then she laughed dryly\na little--a dry, mad laugh.\n\n\'Why did you start when I said that?\' she asked, reading now at random.\n\n\'_I_! I did not start, Clodagh! What made you think that I started? I\ndid not start! Who told you, Clodagh, that Peters takes atropine?\'\n\n\'He is my nephew: I should know. But don\'t look dumbfoundered in that\nabsurd fashion: I have no intention of poisoning him in order to see you\na multimillionaire, and a Peer of the Realm....\'\n\n\'My dearest Clodagh!\'\n\n\'I easily might, however. He will be here presently. He is bringing Mr.\nWilson for the evening.\' (Wilson was going as electrician of the\nexpedition.)\n\n\'Clodagh.\' I said, \'believe me, you jest in a manner which does not\nplease me.\'\n\n\'Do I really?\' she answered with that haughty, stiff half-turn of her\nthroat: \'then I must be more exquisite. But, thank Heaven, it is only a\njest. Women are no longer admired for doing such things.\'\n\n\'Ha! ha! ha!--no--no longer admired, Clodagh! Oh, my good Lord! let us\nchange this talk....\'\n\nBut now she could talk of nothing else. She got from me that afternoon\nthe history of all the Polar expeditions of late years, how far they\nreached, by what aids, and why they failed. Her eyes shone; she listened\neagerly. Before this time, indeed, she had been interested in the\n_Boreal_, knew the details of her outfitting, and was acquainted with\nseveral members of the expedition. But now, suddenly, her mind seemed\nwholly possessed, my mention of Clark\'s visit apparently setting her\nwell a-burn with the Pole-fever.\n\nThe passion of her kiss as I tore myself from her embrace that day I\nshall not forget. I went home with a pretty heavy heart.\n\nThe house of Dr. Peter Peters was three doors from mine, on the opposite\nside of the street. Toward one that night, his footman ran to knock me\nup with the news that Peters was very ill. I hurried to his bed-side,\nand knew by the first glance at his deliriums and his staring pupils\nthat he was poisoned with atropine. Wilson, the electrician, who had\npassed the evening with him at Clodagh\'s in Hanover Square, was there.\n\n\'What on earth is the matter?\' he said to me.\n\n\'Poisoned,\' I answered.\n\n\'Good God! what with?\'\n\n\'Atropine.\'\n\n\'Good Heavens!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be frightened: I think he will recover.\'\n\n\'Is that certain?\'\n\n\'Yes, I think--that is, if he leaves off taking the drug, Wilson.\'\n\n\'What! it is he who has poisoned himself?\'\n\nI hesitated, I hesitated. But I said:\n\n\'He is in the habit of taking atropine, Wilson.\'\n\nThree hours I remained there, and, God knows, toiled hard for his life:\nand when I left him in the dark of the fore-day, my mind was at rest: he\nwould recover.\n\nI slept till 11 A.M., and then hurried over again to Peters. In the room\nwere my two nurses, and Clodagh.\n\nMy beloved put her forefinger to her lips, whispering:\n\n\'Sh-h-h! he is asleep....\'\n\nShe came closer to my ear, saying:\n\n\'I heard the news early. I am come to stay with him, till--the last....\'\n\nWe looked at each other some time--eye to eye, steadily, she and I: but\nmine dropped before Clodagh\'s. A word was on my mouth to say, but I said\nnothing.\n\nThe recovery of Peters was not so steady as I had expected. At the end\nof the first week he was still prostrate. It was then that I said to\nClodagh:\n\n\'Clodagh, your presence at the bed-side here somehow does not please me.\nIt is so unnecessary.\'\n\n\'Unnecessary certainly,\' she replied: \'but I always had a genius for\nnursing, and a passion for watching the battles of the body. Since no\none objects, why should you?\'\n\n\'Ah!... I don\'t know. This is a case that I dislike. I have half a mind\nto throw it to the devil.\'\n\n\'Then do so.\'\n\n\'And you, too--go home, go home, Clodagh!\'\n\n\'But _why_?--if one does no harm. In these days of ""the corruption of\nthe upper classes,"" and Roman decadence of everything, shouldn\'t every\ninnocent whim be encouraged by you upright ones who strive against the\ntide? Whims are the brakes of crimes: and this is mine. I find a\nsensuous pleasure, almost a sensual, in dabbling in delicate drugs--like\nHelen, for that matter, and Medea, and Calypso, and the great antique\nwomen, who were all excellent chymists. To study the human ship in a\ngale, and the slow drama of its foundering--isn\'t that a quite thrilling\ndistraction? And I want you to get into the habit at once of letting me\nhave my little way----\'\n\nNow she touched my hair with a lofty playfulness that soothed me: but\neven then I looked upon the rumpled bed, and saw that the man there was\nreally very sick.\n\nI have still a nausea to write about it! Lucrezia Borgia in her own age\nmay have been heroic: but Lucrezia in this late century! One could retch\nup the heart...\n\nThe man grew sick on that bed, I say. The second week passed, and only\nten days remained before the start of the expedition.\n\nAt the end of that second week, Wilson, the electrician, was one evening\nsitting by Peter\'s bedside when I entered.\n\nAt the moment, Clodagh was about to administer a dose to Peters; but\nseeing me, she put down the medicine-glass on the night table, and came\ntoward me; and as she came, I saw a sight which stabbed me: for Wilson\ntook up the deposited medicine-glass, elevated it, looked at it,\nsmelled into it: and he did it with a kind of hurried, light-fingered\nstealth; and he did it with an under-look, and a meaningness of\nexpression which, I thought, proved mistrust....\n\nMeantime, Clark came each day. He had himself a medical degree, and\nabout this time I called him in professionally, together with Alleyne of\nCavendish Square, to consultation over Peters. The patient lay in a\nsemi-coma broken by passionate vomitings, and his condition puzzled us\nall. I formally stated that he took atropine--had been originally\npoisoned by atropine: but we saw that his present symptoms were not\natropine symptoms, but, it almost seemed, of some other vegetable\npoison, which we could not precisely name.\n\n\'Mysterious thing,\' said Clark to me, when we were alone.\n\n\'_I_ don\'t understand it,\' I said.\n\n\'Who are the two nurses?\'\n\n\'Oh, highly recommended people of my own.\'\n\n\'At any rate, my dream about you comes true, Jeffson. It is clear that\nPeters is out of the running now.\'\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\'I now formally invite you to join the expedition,\' said Clark: \'do you\nconsent?\'\n\nI shrugged again.\n\n\'Well, if that means consent,\' he said, \'let me remind you that you have\nonly eight days, and all the world to do in them.\'\n\nThis conversation occurred in the dining-room of Peters\' house: and as\nwe passed through the door, I saw Clodagh gliding down the passage\noutside--rapidly--away from us.\n\nNot a word I said to her that day about Clark\'s invitation. Yet I asked\nmyself repeatedly: Did she not know of it? Had she not _listened_, and\nheard?\n\nHowever that was, about midnight, to my great surprise, Peters opened\nhis eyes, and smiled. By noon the next day, his fine vitality, which so\nfitted him for an Arctic expedition, had re-asserted itself. He was then\nleaning on an elbow, talking to Wilson, and except his pallor, and\nstrong stomach-pains, there was now hardly a trace of his late approach\nto death. For the pains I prescribed some quarter-grain tablets of\nsulphate of morphia, and went away.\n\nNow, David Wilson and I never greatly loved each other, and that very\nday he brought about a painful situation as between Peters and me, by\ntelling Peters that I had taken his place in the expedition. Peters, a\ntouchy fellow, at once dictated a letter of protest to Clark; and Clark\nsent Peters\' letter to me, marked with a big note of interrogation in\nblue pencil.\n\nNow, all Peters\' preparations were made, mine not; and he had six days\nin which to recover himself. I therefore wrote to Clark, saying that the\nchanged circumstances of course annulled my acceptance of his offer,\nthough I had already incurred the inconvenience of negotiating with a\n_locum tenens_.\n\nThis decided it: Peters was to go, I stay. The fifth day before the\ndeparture dawned. It was a Friday, the 15th June. Peters was now in an\narm-chair. He was cheerful, but with a fevered pulse, and still the\nstomach-pains. I was giving him three quarter-grains of morphia a day.\nThat Friday night, at 11 P.M., I visited him, and found Clodagh there,\ntalking to him. Peters was smoking a cigar.\n\n\'Ah,\' Clodagh said, \'I was waiting for you, Adam. I didn\'t know whether\nI was to inject anything to-night. Is it Yes or No?\'\n\n\'What do you think, Peters?\' I said: \'any more pains?\'\n\n\'Well, perhaps you had better give us another quarter,\' he answered:\n\'there\'s still some trouble in the tummy off and on.\'\n\n\'A quarter-grain, then, Clodagh, \'I said.\n\nAs she opened the syringe-box, she remarked with a pout:\n\n\'Our patient has been naughty! He has taken some more atropine.\'\n\nI became angry at once.\n\n\'Peters,\' I cried, \'you know you have no right to be doing things like\nthat without consulting me! Do that once more, and I swear I have\nnothing further to do with you!\'\n\n\'Rubbish,\' said Peters: \'why all this unnecessary heat? It was a mere\nflea-bite. I felt that I needed it.\'\n\n\'He injected it with his own hand...\' remarked Clodagh.\n\nShe was now standing at the mantel-piece, having lifted the syringe-box\nfrom the night-table, taken from its velvet lining both the syringe and\nthe vial containing the morphia tablets, and gone to the mantel-piece to\nmelt one of the tablets in a little of the distilled water there. Her\nback was turned upon us, and she was a long time. I was standing; Peters\nin his arm-chair, smoking. Clodagh then began to talk about a Charity\nBazaar which she had visited that afternoon.\n\nShe was long, she was long. The crazy thought passed through some dim\nregion of my soul: \'Why is she so _long_?\'\n\n\'Ah, that was a pain!\' went Peters: \'never mind the bazaar, aunt--think\nof the morphia.\'\n\nSuddenly an irresistible impulse seized me--to rush upon her, to dash\nsyringe, tabloids, glass, and all, from her hands. I _must_ have obeyed\nit--I was on the tip-top point of obeying--my body already leant prone:\nbut at that instant a voice at the opened door behind me said:\n\n\'Well, how is everything?\'\n\nIt was Wilson, the electrician, who stood there. With lightning\nswiftness I remembered an under-look of mistrust which I had once seen\non his face. Oh, well, I would not, and could not!--she was my love--I\nstood like marble...\n\nClodagh went to meet Wilson with frank right hand, in the left being the\nfragile glass containing the injection. My eyes were fastened on her\nface: it was full of reassurance, of free innocence. I said to myself:\n\'I must surely be mad!\'\n\nAn ordinary chat began, while Clodagh turned up Peters\' sleeve, and,\nkneeling there, injected his fore-arm. As she rose, laughing at\nsomething said by Wilson, the drug-glass dropped from her hand, and her\nheel, by an apparent accident, trod on it. She put the syringe among a\nnumber of others on the mantel-piece.\n\n\'Your friend has been naughty, Mr. Wilson,\' she said again with that\nsame pout: \'he has been taking more atropine.\'\n\n\'Not really?\' said Wilson.\n\n\'Let me alone, the whole of you,\' answered Peters: \'I ain\'t a child.\'\n\nThese were the last intelligible words he ever spoke. He died shortly\nbefore 1 A.M. He had been poisoned by a powerful dose of atropine.\n\nFrom that moment to the moment when the _Boreal_ bore me down the\nThames, all the world was a mere tumbling nightmare to me, of which\nhardly any detail remains in my memory. Only I remember the inquest, and\nhow I was called upon to prove that Peters had himself injected himself\nwith atropine. This was corroborated by Wilson, and by Clodagh: and the\nverdict was in accordance.\n\nAnd in all that chaotic hurry of preparation, three other things only,\nbut those with clear distinctness now, I remember.\n\nThe first--and chief--is that tempest of words which I heard at\nKensington from that big-mouthed Mackay on the Sunday night. What was it\nthat led me, busy as I was, to that chapel that night? Well, perhaps I\nknow.\n\nThere I sat, and heard him: and most strangely have those words of his\nperoration planted themselves in my brain, when, rising to a passion of\nprophecy, he shouted: \'And as in the one case, transgression was\nfollowed by catastrophe swift and universal, so, in the other, I warn\nthe entire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a\nlowering sky, and thundery weather.\'\n\nAnd this second thing I remember: that on reaching home, I walked into\nmy disordered library (for I had had to hunt out some books), where I\nmet my housekeeper in the act of rearranging things. She had apparently\nlifted an old Bible by the front cover to fling it on the table, for as\nI threw myself into a chair my eye fell upon the open print near the\nbeginning. The print was very large, and a shaded lamp cast a light upon\nit. I had been hearing Mackay\'s wild comparison of the Pole with the\ntree of Eden, and that no doubt was the reason why such a start\nconvulsed me: for my listless eyes had chanced to rest upon some words.\n\n\'The woman gave me of the tree, and I did eat....\'\n\nAnd a third thing I remember in all that turmoil of doubt and flurry:\nthat as the ship moved down with the afternoon tide a telegram was put\ninto my hand; it was a last word from Clodagh; and she said only this:\n\n\'Be first--for Me.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Boreal_ left St. Katherine\'s Docks in beautiful weather on the\nafternoon of the 19th June, full of good hope, bound for the Pole.\n\nAll about the docks was one region of heads stretched far in innumerable\nvagueness, and down the river to Woolwich a continuous dull roar and\nmurmur of bees droned from both banks to cheer our departure.\n\nThe expedition was partly a national affair, subvented by Government:\nand if ever ship was well-found it was the _Boreal_. She had a frame\ntougher far than any battle-ship\'s, capable of ramming some ten yards of\ndrift-ice; and she was stuffed with sufficient pemmican, codroe,\nfish-meal, and so on, to last us not less than six years.\n\nWe were seventeen, all told, the five Heads (so to speak) of the\nundertaking being Clark (our Chief), John Mew (commander), Aubrey\nMaitland (meteorologist), Wilson (electrician), and myself (doctor,\nbotanist, and assistant meteorologist).\n\nThe idea was to get as far east as the 100Â°, or the 120Â°, of longitude;\nto catch there the northern current; to push and drift our way\nnorthward; and when the ship could no further penetrate, to leave her\n(either three, or else four, of us, on ski), and with sledges drawn by\ndogs and reindeer make a dash for the Pole.\n\nThis had also been the plan of the last expedition--that of the\n_Nix_--and of several others. The _Boreal_ only differed from the _Nix_,\nand others, in that she was a thing of nicer design, and of more\nexquisite forethought.\n\nOur voyage was without incident up to the end of July, when we\nencountered a drift of ice-floes. On the 1st August we were at Kabarova,\nwhere we met our coal-ship, and took in a little coal for emergency,\nliquid air being our proper motor; also forty-three dogs, four reindeer,\nand a quantity of reindeer-moss; and two days later we turned our bows\nfinally northward and eastward, passing through heavy \'slack\' ice under\nsail and liquid air in crisp weather, till, on the 27th August, we lay\nmoored to a floe off the desolate island of Taimur.\n\nThe first thing which we saw here was a bear on the shore, watching for\nyoung white-fish: and promptly Clark, Mew, and Lamburn (engineer) went\non shore in the launch, I and Maitland following in the pram, each party\nwith three dogs.\n\nIt was while climbing away inland that Maitland said to me:\n\n\'When Clark leaves the ship for the dash to the Pole, it is three, not\ntwo, of us, after all, that he is going to take with him, making a party\nof four.\'\n\n_I_: \'Is that so? Who knows?\'\n\n_Maitland_: \'Wilson does. Clark has let it out in conversation with\nWilson.\'\n\n_I_: \'Well, the more the merrier. Who will be the three?\'\n\n_Maitland_: \'Wilson is sure to be in it, and there may be Mew, making\nthe third. As to the fourth, I suppose _I_ shall get left out in the\ncold.\'\n\n_I_: \'More likely I.\'\n\n_Maitland_: \'Well, the race is between us four: Wilson, Mew, you and I.\nIt is a question of physical fitness combined with special knowledge.\nYou are too lucky a dog to get left out, Jeffson.\'\n\n_I_: \'Well, what does it matter, so long as the expedition as a whole is\nsuccessful? That is the main thing.\'\n\n_Maitland_: \'Oh yes, that\'s all very fine talk, Jeffson! But is it quite\nsincere? Isn\'t it rather a pose to affect to despise $175,000,000? _I_\nwant to be in at the death, and I mean to be, if I can. We are all more\nor less self-interested.\'\n\n\'Look,\' I whispered--\'a bear.\'\n\nIt was a mother and cub: and with determined trudge she came wagging her\nlow head, having no doubt smelled the dogs. We separated on the\ninstant, doubling different ways behind ice-boulders, wanting her to go\non nearer the shore, before killing; but, passing close, she spied, and\nbore down at a trot upon me. I fired into her neck, and at once, with a\nroar, she turned tail, making now straight in Maitland\'s direction. I\nsaw him run out from cover some hundred yards away, aiming his long-gun:\nbut no report followed: and in half a minute he was under her fore-paws,\nshe striking out slaps at the barking, shrinking dogs. Maitland roared\nfor my help: and at that moment, I, poor wretch, in far worse plight\nthan he, stood shivering in ague: for suddenly one of those wrangles of\nthe voices of my destiny was filling my bosom with loud commotion, one\nurging me to fly to Maitland\'s aid, one passionately commanding me be\nstill. But it lasted, I believe, some seconds only: I ran and got a shot\ninto the bear\'s brain, and Maitland leapt up with a rent down his face.\n\nBut singular destiny! Whatever I did--if I did evil, if I did good--the\nresult was the same: tragedy dark and sinister! Poor Maitland was doomed\nthat voyage, and my rescue of his life was the means employed to make\nhis death the more certain.\n\nI think that I have already written, some pages back, about a man\ncalled Scotland, whom I met at Cambridge. He was always talking about\ncertain \'Black\' and \'White\' beings, and their contention for the earth.\nWe others used to call him the black-and-white mystery-man, because, one\nday--but that is no matter now. Well, with regard to all that, I have a\nfancy, a whim of the mind--quite wide of the truth, no doubt--but I have\nit here in my brain, and I will write it down now. It is this: that\nthere may have been some sort of arrangement, or understanding, between\nBlack and White, as in the case of Adam and the fruit, that, should\nmankind force his way to the Pole and the old forbidden secret biding\nthere, then some mishap should not fail to overtake the race of man;\nthat the White, being kindly disposed to mankind, did not wish this to\noccur, and intended, for the sake of the race, to destroy our entire\nexpedition before it reached; and that the Black, knowing that the White\nmeant to do this, and by what means, used me--_me_!--to outwit this\ndesign, first of all working that I should be one of the party of four\nto leave the ship on ski.\n\nBut the childish attempt, my God, to read the immense riddle of the\nworld! I could laugh loud at myself, and at poor Black-and-White\nScotland, too. The thing can\'t be so simple.\n\nWell, we left Taimur the same day, and good-bye now to both land and\nopen sea. Till we passed the latitude of Cape Chelyuskin (which we did\nnot sight), it was one succession of ice-belts, with Mew in the\ncrow\'s-nest tormenting the electric bell to the engine-room, the anchor\nhanging ready to drop, and Clark taking soundings. Progress was slow,\nand the Polar night gathered round us apace, as we stole still onward\nand onward into that blue and glimmering land of eternal frore. We now\nleft off bed-coverings of reindeer-skin and took to sleeping-bags. Eight\nof the dogs had died by the 25th September, when we were experiencing\n19Â° of frost. In the darkest part of our night, the Northern Light\nspread its silent solemn banner over us, quivering round the heavens in\na million fickle gauds.\n\nThe relations between the members of our little crew were\nexcellent--with one exception: David Wilson and I were not good friends.\n\nThere was a something--a tone--in the evidence which he had given at the\ninquest on Peters, which made me mad every time I thought of it. He had\nheard Peters admit just before death that he, Peters, had administered\natropine to himself: and he had had to give evidence of that fact. But\nhe had given it in a most half-hearted way, so much so, that the coroner\nhad asked him: \'What, sir, are you hiding from me?\' Wilson had replied:\n\'Nothing. I have nothing to tell.\'\n\nAnd from that day he and I had hardly exchanged ten words, in spite of\nour constant companionship in the vessel; and one day, standing alone on\na floe, I found myself hissing with clenched fist: \'If he dared suspect\nClodagh of poisoning Peters, I could _kill_ him!\'\n\nUp to 78Â° of latitude the weather had been superb, but on the night of\nthe 7th October--well I remember it--we experienced a great storm. Our\ntub of a ship rolled like a swing, drenching the whimpering dogs at\nevery lurch, and hurling everything on board into confusion. The\npetroleum-launch was washed from the davits; down at one time to 40Â°\nbelow zero sank the thermometer; while a high aurora was whiffed into a\ndishevelled chaos of hues, resembling the smeared palette of some\nturbulent painter of the skies, or mixed battle of long-robed seraphim,\nand looking the very symbol of tribulation, tempest, wreck, and\ndistraction. I, for the first time, was sick.\n\nIt was with a dizzy brain, therefore, that I went off watch to my bunk.\nSoon, indeed, I fell asleep: but the rolls and shocks of the ship,\ncombined with the heavy Greenland anorak which I had on, and the state\nof my body, together produced a fearful nightmare, in which I was\nconscious of a vain struggle to move, a vain fight for breath, for the\nsleeping-bag turned to an iceberg on my bosom. Of Clodagh was my gasping\ndream. I dreamed that she let fall, drop by drop, a liquid, coloured\nlike pomegranate-seeds, into a glass of water; and she presented the\nglass to Peters. The draught, I knew, was poisonous as death: and in a\nlast effort to break the bands of that dark slumber, I was conscious, as\nI jerked myself upright, of screaming aloud:\n\n\'Clodagh! Clodagh! _Spare the man...!_\'\n\nMy eyes, starting with horror, opened to waking; the electric light was\nshining in the cabin; and there stood David Wilson looking at me.\n\nWilson was a big man, with a massively-built, long face, made longer by\na beard, and he had little nervous contractions of the flesh at the\ncheek-bones, and plenty of big freckles. His clinging pose, his smile of\ndisgust, his whole air, as he stood crouching and lurching there, I can\nshut my eyes, and see now.\n\nWhat he was doing in my cabin I did not know. To think, my good God,\nthat he should have been led there just then! This was one of the\nfour-men starboard berths: _his_ was a-port: yet there he was! But he\nexplained at once.\n\n\'Sorry to interrupt your innocent dreams, says he: \'the mercury in\nMaitland\'s thermometer is frozen, and he asked me to hand him his\nspirits-of-wine one from his bunk...\'\n\nI did not answer. A hatred was in my heart against this man.\n\nThe next day the storm died away, and either three or four days later\nthe slush-ice between the floes froze definitely. The _Boreal\'s_ way was\nthus blocked. We warped her with ice-anchors and the capstan into the\nposition in which she should lay up for her winter\'s drift. This was in\nabout 79Â° 20\' N. The sun had now totally vanished from our bleak sky,\nnot to reappear till the following year.\n\nWell, there was sledging with the dogs, and bear-hunting among the\nhummocks, as the months, one by one, went by. One day Wilson, by far our\nbest shot, got a walrus-bull; Clark followed the traditional pursuit of\na Chief, examining Crustacea; Maitland and I were in a relation of close\nfriendship, and I assisted his meteorological observations in a snow-hut\nbuilt near the ship. Often, through the twenty-four hours, a clear blue\nmoon, very spectral, very fair, suffused all our dim and livid clime.\n\nIt was five days before Christmas that Clark made the great\nannouncement: he had determined, he said, if our splendid northward\ndrift continued, to leave the ship about the middle of next March for\nthe dash to the Pole. He would take with him the four reindeer, all the\ndogs, four sledges, four kayaks, and three companions. The companions\nwhom he had decided to invite were: Wilson, Mew, and Maitland.\n\nHe said it at dinner; and as he said it, David Wilson glanced at my wan\nface with a smile of pleased malice: for _I_ was left out.\n\nI remember well: the aurora that night was in the sky, and at its edge\nfloated a moon surrounded by a ring, with two mock-moons. But all shone\nvery vaguely and far, and a fog, which had already lasted some days,\nmade the ship\'s bows indistinct to me, as I paced the bridge on my\nwatch, two hours after Clark\'s announcement.\n\nFor a long time all was very still, save for the occasional whine of a\ndog. I was alone, and it grew toward the end of my watch, when Maitland\nwould succeed me. My slow tread tolled like a passing-bell, and the\nmountainous ice lay vague and white around me, its sheeted ghastliness\nnot less dreadfully silent than eternity itself.\n\nPresently, several of the dogs began barking together, left off, and\nbegan again.\n\nI said to myself; \'There is a bear about somewhere.\'\n\nAnd after some five minutes I saw--I thought that I saw--it. The fog\nhad, if anything thickened; and it was now very near the end of my\nwatch.\n\nIt had entered the ship, I concluded, by the boards which slanted from\nan opening in the port bulwarks down to the ice. Once before, in\nNovember, a bear, having smelled the dogs, had ventured on board at\nmidnight: but _then_ there had resulted a perfect hubbub among the dogs.\n_Now_, even in the midst of my excitement, I wondered at their\nquietness, though some whimpered--with fear, I thought. I saw the\ncreature steal forward from the hatchway toward the kennels a-port; and\nI ran noiselessly, and seized the watch-gun which stood always loaded by\nthe companionway.\n\nBy this time, the form had passed the kennels, reached the bows, and now\nwas making toward me on the starboard side. I took aim. Never, I\nthought, had I seen so huge a bear--though I made allowance for the\nmagnifying effect of the fog.\n\nMy finger was on the trigger: and at that moment a deathly shivering\nsickness took me, the wrangling voices shouted at me, with \'Shoot!\'\n\'Shoot not!\' \'Shoot!\' Ah well, that latter shout was irresistible. I\ndrew the trigger. The report hooted through the Polar night.\n\nThe creature dropped; both Wilson and Clark were up at once: and we\nthree hurried to the spot.\n\nBut the very first near glance showed a singular kind of bear. Wilson\nput his hand to the head, and a lax skin came away at his touch.... It\nwas Aubrey Maitland who was underneath it, and I had shot him dead.\n\nFor the past few days he had been cleaning skins, among them the skin of\nthe bear from which I had saved him at Taimur. Now, Maitland was a born\npantomimist, continually inventing practical jokes; and perhaps to\nstartle me with a false alarm in the very skin of the old Bruin which\nhad so nearly done for him, he had thrown it round him on finishing its\ncleaning, and so, in mere wanton fun, had crept on deck at the hour of\nhis watch. The head of the bear-skin, and the fog, must have prevented\nhim from seeing me taking aim.\n\nThis tragedy made me ill for weeks. I saw that the hand of Fate was upon\nme. When I rose from bed, poor Maitland was lying in the ice behind the\ngreat camel-shaped hummock near us.\n\nBy the end of January we had drifted to 80Â° 55\'; and it was then that\nClark, in the presence of Wilson, asked me if I would make the fourth\nman, in the place of poor Maitland, for the dash in the spring. As I\nsaid \'Yes, I am willing,\' David Wilson spat with a disgusted emphasis. A\nminute later he sighed, with \'Ah, poor Maitland...\' and drew in his\nbreath with a _tut! tut!_\n\nGod knows, I had an impulse to spring then and there at his throat, and\nstrangle him: but I curbed myself.\n\nThere remained now hardly a month before the dash, and all hands set to\nwork with a will, measuring the dogs, making harness and seal-skin shoes\nfor them, overhauling sledges and kayaks, and cutting every possible\nounce of weight. But we were not destined, after all, to set out that\nyear. About the 20th February, the ice began to pack, and the ship was\nsubjected to an appalling pressure. We found it necessary to make\ntrumpets of our hands to shout into one another\'s ears, for the whole\nice-continent was crashing, popping, thundering everywhere in terrific\nupheaval. Expecting every moment to see the _Boreal_ crushed to\nsplinters, we had to set about unpacking provisions, and placing\nsledges, kayaks, dogs and everything in a position for instant flight.\nIt lasted five days, and was accompanied by a tempest from the north,\nwhich, by the end of February, had driven us back south into latitude\n79Â° 40\'. Clark, of course, then abandoned the thought of the Pole for\nthat summer.\n\nAnd immediately afterwards we made a startling discovery: our stock of\nreindeer-moss was found to be somehow ridiculously small. Egan, our\nsecond mate, was blamed; but that did not help matters: the sad fact\nremained. Clark was advised to kill one or two of the deer, but he\npig-headedly refused: and by the beginning of summer they were all dead.\n\nWell, our northward drift recommenced. Toward the middle of February we\nsaw a mirage of the coming sun above the horizon; there were flights of\nArctic petrels and snow-buntings; and spring was with us. In an ice-pack\nof big hummocks and narrow lanes we made good progress all the summer.\n\nWhen the last of the deer died, my heart sank; and when the dogs killed\ntwo of their number, and a bear crushed a third, I was fully expecting\nwhat actually came; it was this: Clark announced that he could now take\nonly two companions with him in the spring: and they were Wilson and\nMew. So once more I saw David Wilson\'s pleased smile of malice.\n\nWe settled into our second winter-quarters. Again came December, and all\nour drear sunless gloom, made worse by the fact that the windmill would\nnot work, leaving us without the electric light.\n\nAh me, none but those who have felt it could dream of one half the\nmental depression of that long Arctic night; how the soul takes on the\nhue of the world; and without and within is nothing but gloom, gloom,\nand the reign of the Power of Darkness.\n\nNot one of us but was in a melancholic, dismal and dire mood; and on the\n13th December Lamburn, the engineer, stabbed Cartwright, the old\nharpooner, in the arm.\n\nThree days before Christmas a bear came close to the ship, and then\nturned tail. Mew, Wilson, I and Meredith (a general hand) set out in\npursuit. After a pretty long chase we lost him, and then scattered\ndifferent ways. It was very dim, and after yet an hour\'s search, I was\nreturning weary and disgusted to the ship, when I saw some shadow like a\nbear sailing away on my left, and at the same time sighted a man--I did\nnot know whom--running like a handicapped ghost some little distance to\nthe right. So I shouted out:\n\n\'There he is--come on! This way!\'\n\nThe man quickly joined me, but as soon as ever he recognised me, stopped\ndead. The devil must have suddenly got into him, for he said:\n\n\'No, thanks, Jeffson: alone with you I am in danger of my life....\'\n\nIt was Wilson. And I, too, forgetting at once all about the bear,\nstopped and faced him.\n\n\'I see,\' said I. \'But, Wilson, you are going to explain to me _now_ what\nyou mean, you hear? What _do_ you mean, Wilson?\'\n\n\'What I say,\' he answered deliberately, eyeing me up and down: \'alone\nwith you I am in danger of my life. Just as poor Maitland was, and just\nas poor Peters was. Certainly, you are a deadly beast.\'\n\nFury leapt, my God, in my heart. Black as the tenebrous Arctic night was\nmy soul.\n\n\'Do you mean,\' said I, \'that I want to put you out of the way in order\nto go in your place to the Pole? Is that your meaning, man?\'\n\n\'That\'s about my meaning, Jeffson,\' says he: \'you are a deadly beast,\nyou know.\'\n\n\'Stop!\' I said, with blazing eye. \'I am going to kill _you_, Wilson--as\nsure as God lives: but I want to hear first. Who _told_ you that I\nkilled Peters?\'\n\n\'Your lover killed him--with _your_ collusion. Why, I heard you, man, in\nyour beastly sleep, calling the whole thing out. And I was pretty sure\nof it before, only I had no proofs. By God, I should enjoy putting a\nbullet into you, Jeffson!\'\n\n\'You wrong me--you, you wrong me!\' I shrieked, my eyes staring with\nravenous lust for his blood; \'and now I am going to pay you well for it.\n_Look out, you!_\'\n\nI aimed my gun for his heart, and I touched the trigger. He held up his\nleft hand.\n\n\'Stop,\' he said, \'stop.\' (He was one of the coolest of men ordinarily.)\n\'There is no gallows on the _Boreal_, but Clark could easily rig one for\nyou. I want to kill you, too, because there are no criminal courts up\nhere, and it would be doing a good action for my country. But not\nhere--not now. Listen to me--don\'t shoot. Later we can meet, when all is\nready, so that no one may be the wiser, and fight it all out.\'\n\nAs he spoke I let the gun drop. It was better so. I knew that he was\nmuch the best shot on the ship, and I an indifferent one: but I did not\ncare, I did not care, if I was killed.\n\nIt is a dim, inclement land, God knows: and the spirit of darkness and\ndistraction is there.\n\nTwenty hours later we met behind the great saddle-shaped hummock, some\nsix miles to the S.E. of the ship. We had set out at different times, so\nthat no one might suspect. And each brought a ship\'s-lantern.\n\nWilson had dug an ice-grave near the hummock, leaving at its edge a\nheap of brash-ice and snow to fill it. We stood separated by an interval\nof perhaps seventy yards, the grave between us, each with a lantern at\nhis feet.\n\nEven so we were mere shadowy apparitions one to the other. The air\nglowered very drearily, and present in my inmost soul were the frills of\ncold. A chill moon, a mere abstraction of light, seemed to hang far\noutside the universe. The temperature was at 55Â° below zero, so that we\nhad on wind-clothes over our anoraks, and heavy foot-bandages under our\nLap boots. Nothing but a weird morgue seemed the world, haunted with\ndespondent madness; and exactly like that world about us were the minds\nof us two poor men, full of macabre, bleak, and funereal feelings.\n\nBetween us yawned an early grave for one or other of our bodies.\n\nI heard Wilson cry out:\n\n\'Are you ready, Jeffson?\'\n\n\'Aye, Wilson!\' cried I.\n\n\'_Then here goes!_\' cries he.\n\nEven as he spoke, he fired. Surely, the man was in deadly earnest to\nkill me.\n\nBut his shot passed harmlessly by me: as indeed was only likely: we\nwere mere shadows one to the other.\n\nI fired perhaps ten seconds later than he: but in those ten seconds he\nstood perfectly revealed to me in clear, lavender light.\n\nAn Arctic fire-ball had traversed the sky, showering abroad, a\nsulphurous glamour over the snow-landscape. Before the intenser blue of\nits momentary shine had passed away, I saw Wilson stagger forward, and\ndrop. And him and his lantern I buried deep there under the rubble ice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 13th March, nearly three months later, Clark, Mew and I left the\nBoreal in latitude 85Â° 15\'.\n\nWe had with us thirty-two dogs, three sledges, three kayaks, human\nprovisions for 112 days, and dog provisions for 40. Being now about 340\nmiles from the Pole, we hoped to reach it in 43 days, then, turning\nsouth, and feeding living dogs with dead, make either Franz Josef Land\nor Spitzbergen, at which latter place we should very likely come up with\na whaler.\n\nWell, during the first days, progress was very slow, the ice being rough\nand laney, and the dogs behaving most badly, stopping dead at every\ndifficulty, and leaping over the traces. Clark had had the excellent\nidea of attaching a gold-beater\'s-skin balloon, with a lifting power of\n35 pounds, to each sledge, and we had with us a supply of zinc and\nsulphuric-acid to repair the hydrogen-waste from the bags; but on the\nthird day Mew over-filled and burst his balloon, and I and Clark had to\ncut ours loose in order to equalise weights, for we could neither leave\nhim behind, turn back to the ship, nor mend the bag. So it happened that\nat the end of the fourth day out, we had made only nineteen miles, and\ncould still from a hummock discern afar the leaning masts of the old\nBoreal. Clark led on ski, captaining a sledge with 400 lbs. of\ninstruments, ammunition, pemmican, aleuronate bread; Mew followed, his\nsledge containing provisions only; and last came I, with a mixed\nfreight. But on the third day Clark had an attack of snow-blindness, and\nMew took his place.\n\nPretty soon our sufferings commenced, and they were bitter enough. The\nsun, though constantly visible day and night, gave no heat. Our\nsleeping-bags (Clark and Mew slept together in one, I in another) were\nsoaking wet all the night, being thawed by our warmth; and our fingers,\nunder wrappings of senne-grass and wolf-skin, were always bleeding.\nSometimes our frail bamboo-cane kayaks, lying across the sledges, would\ncrash perilously against an ice-ridge--and they were our one hope of\nreaching land. But the dogs were the great difficulty: we lost six\nmortal hours a day in harnessing and tending them. On the twelfth day\nClark took a single-altitude observation, and found that we were only in\nlatitude 86Â° 45\'; but the next day we passed beyond the furthest point\nyet reached by man, viz. 86Â° 53\', attained by the _Nix_ explorers four\nyears previously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur one secret thought now was food, food--our day-long lust for the\neating-time. Mew suffered from \'Arctic thirst.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder these conditions, man becomes in a few days, not a savage only,\nbut a mere beast, hardly a grade above the bear and walrus. Ah, the ice!\nA long and sordid nightmare was that, God knows.\n\nOn we pressed, crawling our little way across the Vast, upon whose hoar\nsilence, from Eternity until then, Bootes only, and that Great Bear, had\nwatched.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the eleventh day our rate of march improved: all lanes\ndisappeared, and ridges became much less frequent. By the fifteenth day\nI was leaving behind the ice-grave of David Wilson at the rate of ten to\nthirteen miles a day.\n\nYet, as it were, his arm reached out and touched me, even there.\n\nHis disappearance had been explained by a hundred different guesses on\nthe ship--all plausible enough. I had no idea that anyone connected me\nin any way with his death.\n\nBut on our twenty-second day of march, 140 miles from our goal, he\ncaused a conflagration of rage and hate to break out among us three.\n\nIt was at the end of a march, when our stomachs were hollow, our frames\nready to drop, and our mood ravenous and inflamed. One of Mew\'s dogs was\nsick: it was necessary to kill it: he asked me to do it.\n\n\'Oh,\' said I, \'you kill your own dog, of course.\'\n\n\'Well, I don\'t know,\' he replied, catching fire at once, \'you ought to\nbe used to killing, Jeffson.\'\n\n\'How do you mean, Mew?\' said I with a mad start, for madness and the\nflames of Hell were instant and uppermost in us all: \'you mean because\nmy profession----\'\n\n\'Profession! damn it, no,\' he snarled like a dog: \'go and dig up David\nWilson--I dare say you know where to find him--and he will tell you my\nmeaning, right enough.\'\n\nI rushed at once to Clark, who was stooping among the dogs,\nunharnessing: and savagely pushing his shoulder, I exclaimed:\n\n\'That beast accuses me of murdering David Wilson!\'\n\n\'Well?\' said Clark.\n\n\'I\'d split his skull as clean----!\'\n\n\'Go away, Adam Jeffson, and let me be!\' snarled Clark.\n\n\'Is that all you\'ve got to say about it, then--you?\'\n\n\'To the devil with you, man, say I, and let me be!\' cried he: \'you know\nyour own conscience best, I suppose.\'\n\nBefore this insult I stood with grinding teeth, but impotent. However,\nfrom that moment a deeper mood of brooding malice occupied my spirit.\nIndeed the humour of us all was one of dangerous, even murderous,\nfierceness. In that pursuit of riches into that region of cold, we had\nbecome almost like the beasts that perish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 10th April we passed the 89th parallel of latitude, and though\nsick to death, both in spirit and body, pressed still on. Like the lower\nanimals, we were stricken now with dumbness, and hardly once in a week\nspoke a word one to the other, but in selfish brutishness on through a\nreal hell of cold we moved. It is a cursed region--beyond doubt\ncursed--not meant to be penetrated by man: and rapid and awful was the\ndegeneration of our souls. As for me, never could I have conceived that\nsavagery so heinous could brood in a human bosom as now I felt it brood\nin mine. If men could enter into a country specially set apart for the\nhabitation of devils, and there become possessed of evil, as we were so\nwould they be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we advanced, the ice every day became smoother; so that, from four\nmiles a day, our rate increased to fifteen, and finally (as the sledges\nlightened) to twenty.\n\nIt was now that we began to encounter a succession of strange-looking\nobjects lying scattered over the ice, whose number continually\nincreased as we proceeded. They had the appearance of rocks, or pieces\nof iron, incrusted with glass-fragments of various colours, and they\nwere of every size. Their incrustations we soon determined to be\ndiamonds, and other precious stones. On our first twenty-mile day Mew\npicked up a diamond-crystal as large as a child\'s foot, and such objects\nsoon became common. We thus found the riches which we sought, beyond all\ndream; but as the bear and the walrus find them: for ourselves we had\nlost; and it was a loss of riches barren as ashes, for all those\nmillions we would not have given an ounce of fish-meal. Clark grumbled\nsomething about their being meteor-stones, whose ferruginous substance\nhad been lured by the magnetic Pole, and kept from frictional burning in\ntheir fall by the frigidity of the air: and they quickly ceased to\ninterest our sluggish minds, except in so far as they obstructed our\nway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had all along had good weather: till, suddenly, on the morning of the\n13th April, we were overtaken by a tempest from the S.W., of such mighty\nand solemn volume that the heart quailed beneath it. It lasted in its\nfull power only an hour, but during that time snatched two of our\nsledges long distances, and compelled us to lie face-downward. We had\ntravelled all the sun-lit night, and were gasping with fatigue; so as\nsoon as the wind allowed us to huddle together our scattered things, we\ncrawled into the sleeping-bags, and instantly slept.\n\nWe knew that the ice was in awful upheaval around us; we heard, as our\neyelids sweetly closed, the slow booming of distant guns, and brittle\ncracklings of artillery. This may have been a result of the tempest\nstirring up the ocean beneath the ice. Whatever it was, we did not care:\nwe slept deep.\n\nWe were within ten miles of the Pole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn my sleep it was as though someone suddenly shook my shoulder with\nurgent \'_Up! up_!\' It was neither Clark nor Mew, but a dream merely: for\nClark and Mew, when I started up, I saw lying still in their\nsleeping-bag.\n\nI suppose it must have been about noon. I sat staring a minute, and my\nfirst numb thought was somehow this: that the Countess Clodagh had\nprayed me \'Be first\'--for her. Wondrous little now cared I for the\nCountess Clodagh in her far unreal world of warmth--precious little for\nthe fortune which she coveted: millions on millions of fortunes lay\nunregarded around me. But that thought, _Be first!_ was deeply suggested\nin my brain, as if whispered there. Instinctively, brutishly, as the\nGadarean swine rushed down a steep place, I, rubbing my daft eyes,\narose.\n\nThe first thing which my mind opened to perceive was that, while the\ntempest was less strong, the ice was now in extraordinary agitation. I\nlooked abroad upon a vast plain, stretched out to a circular, but waving\nhorizon, and varied by many hillocks, boulders, and sparkling\nmeteor-stones that everywhere tinselled the blinding white, some big as\nhouses, most small as limbs. And this great plain was now rearranging\nitself in a widespread drama of havoc, withdrawing in ravines like\nmutual backing curtsies, then surging to clap together in passionate\nmountain-peaks, else jostling like the Symplegades, fluent and\ninconstant as billows of the sea, grinding itself, piling itself,\npouring itself in cataracts of powdered ice, while here and there I saw\nthe meteor-stones leap spasmodically, in dusts and heaps, like geysers\nor spurting froths in a steamer\'s wake, a tremendous uproar, meantime,\nfilling all the air. As I stood, I plunged and staggered, and I found\nthe dogs sprawling, with whimperings, on the heaving floor.\n\nI did not care. Instinctively, daftly, brutishly, I harnessed ten of\nthem to my sledge; put on Canadian snow-shoes: and was away\nnorthward--alone.\n\nThe sun shone with a clear, benign, but heatless shining: a ghostly,\nremote, yet quite limpid light, which seemed designed for the lighting\nof other planets and systems, and to strike here by happy chance. A\ngreat wind from the S.W., meantime, sent thin snow-sweepings flying\nnorthward past me.\n\nThe odometer which I had with me had not yet measured four miles, when I\nbegan to notice two things: first that the jewelled meteor-stones were\nnow accumulating beyond all limit, filling my range of vision to the\nnorthern horizon with a dazzling glister: in mounds, and parterres, and\nscattered disconnection they lay, like largesse of autumn leaves, spread\nout over those Elysian fields and fairy uplands of wealth, trillions of\nbillions, so that I had need to steer my twining way among them. Now,\ntoo, I noticed that, but for these stones, all roughness had\ndisappeared, not a trace of the upheaval going on a little further south\nbeing here, for the ice lay positively as smooth as a table before me.\nIt is my belief that this stretch of smooth ice has never, never felt\none shock, or stir, or throe, and reaches right down to the bottom of\nthe deep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now with a wild hilarity I flew. Gradually, a dizziness, a lunacy,\nhad seized upon me, till finally, up-buoyed on air, and dancing mad, I\nsped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and\neyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had\nits hand of ice upon my heart, I being so alone in that place, face to\nface with the Ineffable: but still with a giddy levity, and a fatal joy,\nand a blind hilarity, on I sped, I spun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odometer measured nine miles from my start. I was in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the Pole.\n\nI cannot say when it began, but now I was conscious of a sound in my\nears, distinct and near, a steady sound of splashing, or fluttering,\nresembling the noising of a cascade or brook: and it grew. Forty more\nsteps I took (slide I could not now for the meteorites)--perhaps\nsixty--perhaps eighty: and now, to my sudden horror, I stood by a\ncircular clean-cut lake.\n\nOne minute only, swaying and nodding there, I stood: and then I dropped\ndown flat in swoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a hundred years, I suppose, I should never succeed in analysing\n_why_ I swooned: but my consciousness still retains the impression of\nthat horrid thrill. I saw nothing distinctly, for my whole being reeled\nand toppled drunken, like a spinning-top in desperate death-struggle at\nthe moment when it flags, and wobbles dissolutely to fall; but the very\ninstant that my eyes met what was before me, I knew, I knew, that here\nwas the Sanctity of Sanctities, the old eternal inner secret of the Life\nof this Earth, which it was a most burning shame for a man to see. The\nlake, I fancy, must be a mile across, and in its middle is a pillar of\nice, very low and broad; and I had the clear impression, or dream, or\nnotion, that there was a name, or word, graven all round in the ice of\nthe pillar in characters which I could never read; and under the name a\nlong date; and the fluid of the lake seemed to me to be wheeling with a\nshivering ecstasy, splashing and fluttering, round the pillar, always\nfrom west to east, in the direction of the spinning of the earth; and it\nwas borne in upon me--I can\'t at all say how--that this fluid was the\nsubstance of a living creature; and I had the distinct fancy, as my\nsenses failed, that it was a creature with many dull and anguished eyes,\nand that, as it wheeled for ever round in fluttering lust, it kept its\neyes always turned upon the name and the date graven in the pillar. But\nthis must be my madness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must have been not less than an hour before a sense of life returned\nto me; and when the thought stabbed my brain that a long, long time I\nhad lain there in the presence of those gloomy orbs, my spirit seemed to\ngroan and die within me.\n\nIn some minutes, however, I had scrambled to my feet, clutched at a\ndog\'s harness, and without one backward glance, was flying from that\nplace.\n\nHalf-way to the halting-place, I waited Clark and Mew, being very sick\nand doddering, and unable to advance. But they did not come.\n\nLater on, when I gathered force to go further, I found that they had\nperished in the upheaval of the ice. One only of the sledges, half\nburied, I saw near the spot of our bivouac.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone that same day I began my way southward, and for five days made\ngood progress. On the eighth day I noticed, stretched right across the\nsouth-eastern horizon, a region of purple vapour which luridly obscured\nthe face of the sun: and day after day I saw it steadily brooding\nthere. But what it could be I did not understand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, onward through the desert ice I continued my lonely way, with a\nbaleful shrinking terror in my heart; for very stupendous, alas! is the\nburden of that Arctic solitude upon one poor human soul.\n\nSometimes on a halt I have lain and listened long to the hollow silence,\nrecoiling, crushed by it, hoping that at least one of the dogs might\nwhine. I have even crept shivering from the thawed sleeping-bag to flog\na dog, so that I might hear a sound.\n\nI had started from the Pole with a well-filled sledge, and the sixteen\ndogs left alive from the ice-packing which buried my comrades. This was\non the evening of the 13th April. I had saved from the wreck of our\nthings most of the whey-powder, pemmican, &c., as well as the\ntheodolite, compass, chronometer, train-oil lamp for cooking, and other\nimplements: I was therefore in no doubt as to my course, and I had\nprovisions for ninety days. But ten days from the start my supply of\ndog-food failed, and I had to begin to slaughter my only companions, one\nby one.\n\nWell, in the third week the ice became horribly rough, and with moil\nand toil enough to wear a bear to death, I did only five miles a day.\nAfter the day\'s work I would crawl with a dying sigh into the\nsleeping-bag, clad still in the load of skins which stuck to me a mere\nfilth of grease, to sleep the sleep of a swine, indifferent if I never\nwoke.\n\nAlways--day after day--on the south-eastern horizon, brooded sullenly\nthat curious stretched-out region of purple vapour, like the smoke of\nthe conflagration of the world. And I noticed that its length constantly\nreached out and out, and silently grew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce I had a very pleasant dream. I dreamed that I was in a garden--an\nArabian paradise--so sweet was the perfume. All the time, however, I had\na sub-consciousness of the gale which was actually blowing from the S.E.\nover the ice, and, at the moment when I awoke, was half-wittedly droning\nto myself; \'It is a Garden of Peaches; but I am not really in the\ngarden: I am really on the ice; only, the S.E. storm is wafting to me\nthe aroma of this Garden of Peaches.\'\n\nI opened my eyes--I started--I sprang to my feet! For, of all the\nmiracles!--I could not doubt--an actual aroma like peach-blossom was in\nthe algid air about me!\n\nBefore I could collect my astonished senses, I began to vomit pretty\nviolently, and at the same time saw some of the dogs, mere skeletons as\nthey were, vomiting, too. For a long time I lay very sick in a kind of\ndaze, and, on rising, found two of the dogs dead, and all very queer.\nThe wind had now changed to the north.\n\nWell, on I staggered, fighting every inch of my deplorably weary way.\nThis odour of peach-blossom, my sickness, and the death of the two dogs,\nremained a wonder to me.\n\nTwo days later, to my extreme mystification (and joy), I came across a\nbear and its cub lying dead at the foot of a hummock. I could not\nbelieve my eyes. There she lay on her right side, a spot of dirty-white\nin a disordered patch of snow, with one little eye open, and her\nfierce-looking mouth also; and the cub lay across her haunch, biting\ninto her rough fur. I set to work upon her, and allowed the dogs a\nglorious feed on the blubber, while I myself had a great banquet on the\nfresh meat. I had to leave the greater part of the two carcasses, and I\ncan feel again now the hankering reluctance--quite unnecessary, as it\nturned out--with which I trudged onwards. Again and again I found\nmyself asking: \'Now, what could have killed those two bears?\'\n\nWith brutish stolidness I plodded ever on, almost like a walking\nmachine, sometimes nodding in sleep while I helped the dogs, or\nmanouvred the sledge over an ice-ridge, pushing or pulling. On the 3rd\nJune, a month and a half from my start, I took an observation with the\ntheodolite, and found that I was not yet 400 miles from the Pole, in\nlatitude 84Â° 50\'. It was just as though some Will, some Will, was\nobstructing and retarding me.\n\nHowever, the intolerable cold was over, and soon my clothes no longer\nhung stark on me like armour. Pools began to appear in the ice, and\npresently, what was worse, my God, long lanes, across which, somehow, I\nhad to get the sledge. But about the same time all fear of starvation\npassed away: for on the 6th June I came across another dead bear, on the\n7th three, and thenceforth, in rapidly growing numbers, I met not bears\nonly, but fulmars, guillemots, snipes, Ross\'s gulls, little awks--all,\nall, lying dead on the ice. And never anywhere a living thing, save me,\nand the two remaining dogs.\n\nIf ever a poor man stood shocked before a mystery, it was I now. I had a\nbig fear on my heart.\n\nOn the 2nd July the ice began packing dangerously, and soon another\nstorm broke loose upon me from the S.W. I left off my trek, and put up\nthe silk tent on a five-acre square of ice surrounded by lanes: and\n_again_--for the second time--as I lay down, I smelled that delightful\nstrange odour of peach-blossom, a mere whiff of it, and presently\nafterwards was taken sick. However, it passed off this time in a couple\nof hours.\n\nNow it was all lanes, lanes, alas! yet no open water, and such was the\ndifficulty and woe of my life, that sometimes I would drop flat on the\nice, and sob: \'Oh, no more, no more, my God: here let me die.\' The\ncrossing of a lane might occupy ten or twelve entire hours, and then, on\nthe other side I might find another one opening right before me.\nMoreover, on the 8th July, one of the dogs, after a feed on blubber,\nsuddenly died; and there was left me only \'Reinhardt,\' a white-haired\nSiberian dog, with little pert up-sticking ears, like a cat\'s. Him, too,\nI had to kill on coming to open water.\n\nThis did not happen till the 3rd August, nearly four months from the\nPole.\n\nI can\'t think, my God, that any heart of man ever tholed the appalling\nnightmare and black abysm of sensations in which, during those four\nlong desert months, I weltered: for though I was as a brute, I had a\nman\'s heart to feel. What I had seen, or dreamed, at the Pole followed\nand followed me; and if I shut my poor weary eyes to sleep, those others\nyonder seemed to watch me still with their distraught and gloomy gaze,\nand in my spinning dark dreams spun that eternal ecstasy of the lake.\n\nHowever, by the 28th July I knew from the look of the sky, and the\nabsence of fresh-water ice, that the sea could not be far; so I set to\nwork, and spent two days in putting to rights the now battered kayak.\nThis done, I had no sooner resumed my way than I sighted far off a\nstreaky haze, which I knew to be the basalt cliffs of Franz Josef Land;\nand in a craziness of joy I stood there, waving my ski-staff about my\nhead, with the senile cheers of a very old man.\n\nIn four days this land was visibly nearer, sheer basaltic cliffs mixed\nwith glacier, forming apparently a great bay, with two small islands in\nthe mid-distance; and at fore-day of the 3rd August I arrived at the\ndefinite edge of the pack-ice in moderate weather at about the\nfreezing-point.\n\nI at once, but with great reluctance, shot Reinhardt, and set to work to\nget the last of the provisions, and the most necessary of the\nimplements, into the kayak, making haste to put out to the toilless\nluxury of being borne on the water, after all the weary trudge. Within\nfourteen hours I was coasting, with my little lug-sail spread, along the\nshore-ice of that land. It was midnight of a calm Sabbath, and low on\nthe horizon smoked the drowsing red sun-ball, as my canvas skiff lightly\nchopped her little way through this silent sea. Silent, silent: for\nneither snort of walrus, nor yelp of fox, nor cry of startled kittiwake,\ndid I hear: but all was still as the jet-black shadow of the cliffs and\nglacier on the tranquil sea: and many bodies of dead things strewed the\nsurface of the water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I found a little fjord, I went up it to the end where stood a\nstretch of basalt columns, looking like a shattered temple of\nAntediluvians; and when my foot at last touched land, I sat down there a\nlong, long time in the rubbly snow, and silently wept. My eyes that\nnight were like a fountain of tears. For the firm land is health and\nsanity, and dear to the life of man; but I say that the great ungenial\nice is a nightmare, and a blasphemy, and a madness, and the realm of the\nPower of Darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew that I was at Franz Josef Land, somewhere or other in the\nneighbourhood of C. Fligely (about 82Â° N.), and though it was so late,\nand getting cold, I still had the hope of reaching Spitzbergen that\nyear, by alternately sailing all open water, and dragging the kayak over\nthe slack drift-ice. All the ice which I saw was good flat fjord-ice,\nand the plan seemed feasible enough; so after coasting about a little,\nand then three days\' good rest in the tent at the bottom of a ravine of\ncolumnar basalt opening upon the shore, I packed some bear and walrus\nflesh, with what artificial food was left, into the kayak, and I set out\nearly in the morning, coasting the shore-ice with sail and paddle. In\nthe afternoon I managed to climb a little way up an iceberg, and made\nout that I was in a bay whose terminating headlands were invisible. I\naccordingly decided to make S.W. by W. to cross it, but, in doing so, I\nwas hardly out of sight of land, when a northern storm overtook me\ntoward midnight; before I could think, the little sail was all but\nwhiffed away, and the kayak upset. I only saved it by the happy chance\nof being near a floe with an ice-foot, which, projecting under the\nwater, gave me foot-hold; and I lay on the floe in a mooning state the\nwhole night under the storm, for I was half drowned.\n\nAnd at once, on recovering myself, I abandoned all thought of whalers\nand of Europe for that year. Happily, my instruments, &c., had been\nsaved by the kayak-deck when she capsized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards inland from the shore-rim, in a circular place where\nthere was some moss and soil, I built myself a semi-subterranean Eskimo\nden for the long Polar night. The spot was quite surrounded by high\nsloping walls of basalt, except to the west, where they opened in a\nthree-foot cleft to the shore, and the ground was strewn with slabs and\nboulders of granite and basalt. I found there a dead she-bear, two\nwell-grown cubs, and a fox, the latter having evidently fallen from the\ncliffs; in three places the snow was quite red, overgrown with a red\nlichen, which at first I took for blood. I did not even yet feel secure\nfrom possible bears, and took care to make my den fairly tight, a work\nwhich occupied me nearly four weeks, for I had no tools, save a hatchet,\nknife, and metal-shod ski-staff. I dug a passage in the ground two feet\nwide, two deep, and ten long, with perpendicular sides, and at its north\nend a circular space, twelve feet across, also with perpendicular sides,\nwhich I lined with stones; the whole excavation I covered with\ninch-thick walrus-hide, skinned during a whole bitter week from four of\na number that lay about the shore-ice; for ridge-pole I used a thin\npointed rock which I found near, though, even so, the roof remained\nnearly flat. This, when it was finished, I stocked well, putting in\neverything, except the kayak, blubber to serve both for fuel and\noccasional light, and foods of several sorts, which I procured by merely\nstretching out the hand. The roof of both circular part and passage was\nsoon buried under snow and ice, and hardly distinguishable from the\ngeneral level of the white-clad ground. Through the passage, if I passed\nin or out, I crawled flat, on hands and knees: but that was rare: and in\nthe little round interior, mostly sitting in a cowering attitude, I\nwintered, harkening to the large and windy ravings of darkling December\nstorms above me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll those months the burden of a thought bowed me; and an unanswered\nquestion, like the slow turning of a mechanism, revolved in my gloomy\nspirit: for everywhere around me lay bears, walruses, foxes, thousands\nupon thousands of little awks, kittiwakes, snow-owls, eider-ducks,\ngulls-dead, dead. Almost the only living things which I saw were some\nwalruses on the drift-floes: but very few compared with the number\nwhich I expected. It was clear to me that some inconceivable catastrophe\nhad overtaken the island during the summer, destroying all life about\nit, except some few of the amphibia, cetacea, and crustacea.\n\nOn the 5th December, having crept out from the den during a southern\nstorm, I had, for the third time, a distant whiff of that self-same\nodour of peach-blossom: but now without any after-effects.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, again came Christmas, the New Year--Spring: and on the 22nd May I\nset out with a well-stocked kayak. The water was fairly open, and the\nice so good, that at one place I could sail the kayak over it, the wind\nsending me sliding at a fine pace. Being on the west coast of Franz\nJosef Land, I was in as favourable a situation as possible, and I turned\nmy bow southward with much hope, keeping a good many days just in sight\nof land. Toward the evening of my third day out I noticed a large flat\nfloe, presenting far-off a singular and lovely sight, for it seemed\nfreighted thick with a profusion of pink and white roses, showing in its\nclear crystal the empurpled reflection. On getting near I saw that it\nwas covered with millions of Ross\'s gulls, all dead, whose pretty rosy\nbosoms had given it that appearance.\n\nUp to the 29th June I made good progress southward and westward (the\nweather being mostly excellent), sometimes meeting dead bears, floating\naway on floes, sometimes dead or living walrus-herds, with troop after\ntroop of dead kittiwakes, glaucus and ivory gulls, skuas, and every kind\nof Arctic fowl. On that last day--the 29th June--I was about to encamp\non a floe soon after midnight, when, happening to look toward the sun,\nmy eye fell, far away south across the ocean of floes, upon\nsomething--_the masts of a ship_.\n\nA phantom ship, or a real ship: it was all one; real, I must have\ninstantly felt, it could not be: but at a sight so incredible my heart\nset to beating in my bosom as though I must surely die, and feebly\nwaving the cane oar about my head, I staggered to my knees, and thence\nwith wry mouth toppled flat.\n\nSo overpoweringly sweet was the thought of springing once more, like the\nbeasts of Circe, from a walrus into a man. At this time I was tearing my\nbear\'s-meat just like a bear; I was washing my hands in walrus-blood to\nproduce a glairy sort of pink cleanliness, in place of the black grease\nwhich chronically coated them.\n\nWorn as I was, I made little delay to set out for that ship; and I had\nnot travelled over water and ice four hours when, to my in-describable\njoy, I made out from the top of a steep floe that she was the _Boreal_.\nIt seemed most strange that she should be anywhere hereabouts: I could\nonly conclude that she must have forced and drifted her way thus far\nwestward out of the ice-block in which our party had left her, and\nperhaps now was loitering here in the hope of picking us up on our way\nto Spitzbergen.\n\nIn any case, wild was the haste with which I fought my way to be at her,\nmy gasping mouth all the time drawn back in a _rictus_ of laughter at\nthe anticipation of their gladness to see me, their excitement to hear\nthe grand tidings of the Pole attained. Anon I waved the paddle, though\nI knew that they could not yet see me, and then I dug deep at the\nwhitish water. What astonished me was her main-sail and fore-mast\nsquare-sail--set that calm morning; and her screws were still, for she\nmoved not at all. The sun was abroad like a cold spirit of light,\ntouching the great ocean-room of floes with dazzling spots, and a tint\nalmost of rose was on the world, as it were of a just-dead bride in her\nspangles and white array. The _Boreal_ was the one little distant\njet-black spot in all this purity: and upon her, as though she were\nHeaven, I paddled, I panted. But she was in a queerish state: by 9 A.M.\nI could see that. Two of the windmill arms were not there, and half\nlowered down her starboard beam a boat hung askew; moreover, soon after\n10 I could clearly see that her main-sail had a long rent down the\nmiddle.\n\nI could not at all make her out. She was not anchored, though a\nsheet-anchor hung over at the starboard cathead; she was not moored; and\ntwo small ice-floes, one on each side, were sluggishly bombarding her\nbows.\n\nI began now to wave the paddle, battling for my breath, ecstatic, crazy\nwith excitement, each second like a year to me. Very soon I could make\nout someone at the bows, leaning well over, looking my way. Something\nput it into my head that it was Sallitt, and I began an impassioned\nshouting. \'Hi! Sallitt! Hallo! Hi!\' I called.\n\nI did not see him move: I was still a good way off: but there he stood,\nleaning steadily over, looking my way. Between me and the ship now was\nall navigable water among the floes, and the sight of him so visibly\nnear put into me such a shivering eagerness, that I was nothing else but\na madman for the time, sending the kayak flying with venomous digs in\nquick-repeated spurts, and mixing with the diggings my crazy wavings,\nand with both the daft shoutings of \'Hallo! Hi! Bravo! I have _been to\nthe Pole!_\'\n\nWell, vanity, vanity. Nearer still I drew: it was broad morning, going\non toward noon: I was half a mile away, I was fifty yards. But on board\nthe _Boreal_, though now they _must_ have heard me, seen me, I observed\nno movement of welcome, but all, all was still as death that still\nArctic morning, my God. Only, the ragged sail flapped a little, and--one\non each side--two ice-floes sluggishly bombarded the bows, with hollow\nsounds.\n\nI was certain now that Sallitt it was who looked across the ice: but\nwhen the ship swung a little round, I noticed that the direction of his\ngaze was carried with her movement, he no longer looking my way.\n\n\'Why, Sallitt!\' I shouted reproachfully: \'why, Sallitt, man...!\' I\nwhined.\n\nBut even as I shouted and whined, a perfect wild certainty was in my\nheart: for an aroma like peach, my God, had been suddenly wafted from\nthe ship upon me, and I must have very well known then that that\nwatchful outlook of Sallitt saw nothing, and on the _Boreal_ were dead\nmen all; indeed, very soon I saw one of his eyes looking like a glass\neye which has slid askew, and glares distraught. And now again my\nwretched body failed, and my head dropped forward, where I sat, upon\nthe kayak-deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, after a long time, I lifted myself to look again at that forlorn\nand wandering craft. There she lay, quiet, tragic, as it were culpable\nof the dark secret she bore; and Sallitt, who had been such good friends\nwith me, would not cease his stare. I knew quite well why he was there:\nhe had leant over to vomit, and had leant ever since, his forearms\npressed on the bulwark-beam, his left knee against the boards, and his\nleft shoulder propped on the cathead. When I came quite near, I saw that\nwith every bump of the two floes against the bows, his face shook in\nresponse, and nodded a little; strange to say, he had no covering on his\nhead, and I noted the play of the faint breezes in his uncut hair. After\na time I would approach no more, for I was afraid; I did not dare, the\nsilence of the ship seemed so sacred and awful; and till late afternoon\nI sat there, watching the black and massive hull. Above her water-line\nemerged all round a half-floating fringe of fresh-green sea-weed,\nproving old neglect; an abortive attempt had apparently been made to\nlower, or take in, the larch-wood pram, for there she hung by a jammed\ndavit-rope, stern up, bow in the water; the only two arms of the\nwindmill moved this way and that, through some three degrees, with an\n_andante_ creaking sing-song; some washed clothes, tied on the bow-sprit\nrigging to dry, were still there; the iron casing all round the bluff\nbows was red and rough with rust; at several points the rigging was in\nconsiderable tangle; occasionally the boom moved a little with a\ntortured skirling cadence; and the sail, rotten, I presume, from\nexposure--for she had certainly encountered no bad weather--gave out\nanon a heavy languid flap at a rent down the middle. Besides Sallitt,\nlooking out there where he had jammed himself, I saw no one.\n\nBy a paddle-stroke now, and another presently, I had closely approached\nher about four in the afternoon, though my awe of the ship was\ncomplicated by that perfume of hers, whose fearful effects I knew. My\ntentative approach, however, proved to me, when I remained unaffected,\nthat, here and now, whatever danger there had been was past; and\nfinally, by a hanging rope, with a thumping desperation of heart, I\nclambered up her beam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had died, it seemed, very suddenly, for nearly all the twelve were\nin poses of activity. Egan was in the very act of ascending the\ncompanion-way; Lamburn was sitting against the chart-room door,\napparently cleaning two carbines; Odling at the bottom of the\nengine-room stair seemed to be drawing on a pair of reindeer komagar;\nand Cartwright, who was often in liquor, had his arms frozen tight round\nthe neck of Martin, whom he seemed to be kissing, they two lying stark\nat the foot of the mizzen-mast.\n\nOver all--over men, decks, rope-coils--in the cabin, in the\nengine-room--between skylight leaves--on every shelf, in every\ncranny--lay a purplish ash or dust, very impalpably fine. And steadily\nreigning throughout the ship, like the very spirit of death, was that\naroma of peach-blossom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere it had reigned, as I could see from the log-dates, from the rust on\nthe machinery, from the look of the bodies, from a hundred indications,\nduring something over a year. It was, therefore, mainly by the random\nworkings of winds and currents that this fragrant ship of death had been\nbrought hither to me.\n\nAnd this was the first direct intimation which I had that the Unseen\nPowers (whoever and whatever they may be), who through the history of\nthe world had been so very, very careful to conceal their Hand from the\neyes of men, hardly any longer intended to be at the pains to conceal\ntheir Hand from me. It was just as though the Boreal had been openly\npresented to me by a spiritual agency, which, though I could not see it,\nI could readily apprehend.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dust, though very thin and flighty above-decks, lay thickly\ndeposited below, and after having made a tour of investigation\nthroughout the ship, the first thing which I did was to examine\nthat--though I had tasted nothing all day, and was exhausted to death. I\nfound my own microscope where I had left it in the box in my berth to\nstarboard, though I had to lift up Egan to get at it, and to step over\nLamburn to enter the chart-room; but there, toward evening, I sat at the\ntable and bent to see if I could make anything of the dust, while it\nseemed to me as if all the myriad spirits of men that have sojourned on\nthe earth, and angel and devil, and all Time and all Eternity, hung\nsilent round for my decision; and such an ague had me, that for a long\ntime my wandering finger-tips, all ataxic with agitation, eluded every\ndelicate effort which I made, and I could nothing do. Of course, I know\nthat an odour of peach-blossom in the air, resulting in death, could\nonly be associated with some vaporous effluvium of cyanogen, or of\nhydrocyanic (\'prussic\') acid, or of both; and when I at last managed to\nexamine some of the dust under the microscope, I was not therefore\nsurprised to find, among the general mass of purplish ash, a number of\nbright-yellow particles, which could only be minute crystals of potassic\nferrocyanide. What potassic ferrocyanide was doing on board the _Boreal_\nI did not know, and I had neither the means, nor the force of mind,\nalas! to dive then further into the mystery; I understood only that by\nsome extraordinary means the air of the region just south of the Polar\nenviron had been impregnated with a vapour which was either cyanogen, or\nsome product of cyanogen; also, that this deadly vapour, which is very\nsoluble, had by now either been dissolved by the sea, or else dispersed\ninto space (probably the latter), leaving only its faint after-perfume;\nand seeing this, I let my poor abandoned head drop again on the table,\nand long hours I sat there staring mad, for I had a suspicion, my God,\nand a fear, in my breast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Boreal,_ I found, contained sufficient provisions, untouched by\nthe dust, in cases, casks, &c., to last me, probably, fifty years. After\ntwo days, when I had partially scrubbed and boiled the filth of fifteen\nmonths from my skin, and solaced myself with better food, I overhauled\nher thoroughly, and spent three more days in oiling and cleaning the\nengine. Then, all being ready, I dragged my twelve dead and laid them\ntogether in two rows on the chart-room floor; and I hoisted for love the\npoor little kayak which had served me through so many tribulations. At\nnine in the morning of the 6th July, a week from my first sighting of\nthe _Boreal_, I descended to the engine-room to set out.\n\nThe screws, like those of most quite modern ships, were driven by the\nsimple contrivance of a constant stream of liquid air, contained in very\npowerful tanks, exploding through capillary tubes into non-expansion\nslide-valve chests, much as in the ordinary way with steam: a motor\nwhich gave her, in spite of her bluff hulk, a speed of sixteen knots. It\nis, therefore, the simplest thing for one man to take these ships round\nthe world, since their movement, or stopping, depend upon nothing but\nthe depressing or raising of a steel handle, provided that one does not\nget blown to the sky meantime, as liquid air, in spite of its thousand\nadvantages, occasionally blows people. At any rate, I had tanks of air\nsufficient to last me through twelve years\' voyaging; and there was the\nordinary machine on board for making it, with forty tons of coal, in\ncase of need, in the bunkers, and two excellent Belleville boilers: so I\nwas well supplied with motors at least.\n\nThe ice here was quite slack, and I do not think I ever saw Arctic\nweather so bright and gay, the temperature at 41Â°. I found that I was\nmidway between Franz Josef and Spitzbergen, in latitude 79Â° 23\' N. and\nlongitude 39Â° E.; my way was perfectly clear; and something almost like\na mournful hopefulness was in me as the engines slid into their clanking\nturmoil, and those long-silent screws began to churn the Arctic sea. I\nran up with alacrity and took my stand at the wheel; and the bows of my\neventful Argo turned southward and westward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I needed food or sleep, the ship slept, too: when I awoke, she\ncontinued her way.\n\nSixteen hours a day sometimes I stood sentinel at that wheel,\noverlooking the varied monotony of the ice-sea, till my knees would\ngive, and I wondered why a wheel at which one might sit was not\ncontrived, rather delicate steering being often required among the floes\nand bergs. By now, however, I was less weighted with my ball of Polar\nclothes, and stood almost slim in a Lap great-coat, a round Siberian fur\ncap on my head.\n\nAt midnight when I threw myself into my old berth, it was just as though\nthe engines, subsided now into silence, were a dead thing, and had a\nghost which haunted me; for I heard them still, and yet not them, but\nthe silence of their ghost.\n\nSometimes I would startle from sleep, horrified to the heart at some\nsound of exploding iceberg, or bumping floe, noising far through that\nwhite mystery of quietude, where the floes and bergs were as floating\ntombs, and the world a liquid cemetery. Never could I describe the\nstrange Doom\'s-day shock with which such a sound would recall me from\nfar depths of chaos to recollection of myself: for often-times, both\nwaking and in nightmare, I did not know on which planet I was, nor in\nwhich Age, but felt myself adrift in the great gulf of time and space\nand circumstance, without bottom for my consciousness to stand upon; and\nthe world was all mirage and a new show to me; and the boundaries of\ndream and waking lost.\n\nWell, the weather was most fair all the time, and the sea like a pond.\nDuring the morning of the fifth day, the 11th July, I entered, and went\nmoving down, an extraordinary long avenue of snow-bergs and floes, most\nregularly placed, half a mile across and miles long, like a Titanic\ndouble-procession of statues, or the Ming Tombs, but rising and sinking\non the cadenced swell; many towering high, throwing placid shadows on\nthe aisle between; some being of a lucid emerald tint; and three or four\npouring down cascades that gave a far and chaunting sound. The sea\nbetween was of a strange thick bluishness, almost like raw egg-white;\nwhile, as always here, some snow-clouds, white and woolly, floated in\nthe pale sky. Down this avenue, which produced a mysterious impression\nof Cyclopean cathedrals and odd sequesteredness, I had not passed a\nmile, when I sighted a black object at the end.\n\nI rushed to the shrouds, and very soon made out a whaler.\n\nAgain the same panting agitations, mad rage to be at her, at once\npossessed me; I flew to the indicator, turned the lever to full, then\nback to give the wheel a spin, then up the main-mast ratlins, waving a\nlong foot-bandage of vadmel tweed picked up at random, and by the time I\nwas within five hundred yards of her, had worked myself to such a pitch,\nthat I was again shouting that futile madness: \'Hullo! Hi! Bravo! _I\nhave been to the Pole!_\'\n\nAnd those twelve dead that I had in the chart-room there must have heard\nme, and the men on the whaler must have heard me, and smiled their\nsmile.\n\nFor, as to that whaler, I should have known better at once, if I had not\nbeen crazy, since she _looked_ like a ship of death, her boom slamming\nto port and starboard on the gentle heave of the sea, and her fore-sail\nreefed that serene morning. Only when I was quite near her, and hurrying\ndown to stop the engines, did the real truth, with perfect suddenness,\ndrench my heated brain; and I almost ran into her, I was so stunned.\n\nHowever, I stopped the _Boreal_ in time, and later on lowered the kayak,\nand boarded the other.\n\nThis ship had evidently been stricken silent in the midst of a perfect\ndrama of activity, for I saw not one of her crew of sixty-two who was\nnot busy, except one boy. I found her a good-sized thing of 500 odd\ntons, ship-rigged, with auxiliary engine of seventy horse-power, and\npretty heavily armour-plated round the bows. There was no part of her\nwhich I did not over-haul, and I could see that they had had a great\ntime with whales, for a mighty carcass, attached to the outside of the\nship by the powerful cant-purchase tackle, had been in process of\nflensing and cutting-in, and on the deck two great blankets of blubber,\nlooking each a ton-weight, surrounded by twenty-seven men in many\nattitudes, some terrifying to see, some disgusting, several grotesque,\nall so unhuman, the whale dead, and the men dead, too, and death was\nthere, and the rank-flourishing germs of Inanity, and a mesmerism, and a\nsilence, whose dominion was established, and its reign was growing old.\nFour of them, who had been removing the gums from a mass of stratified\nwhalebone at the mizzen-mast foot, were quite imbedded in whale-flesh;\nalso, in a barrel lashed to the top of the main top-gallant masthead was\nvisible the head of a man with a long pointed beard, looking steadily\nout over the sea to the S.W., which made me notice that five only of the\nprobable eight or nine boats were on board; and after visiting the\n\'tween-decks, where I saw considerable quantities of stowed whalebone\nplates, and about fifty or sixty iron oil-tanks, and cut-up blubber; and\nafter visiting cabin, engine-room, fo\'cas\'le, where I saw a lonely boy\nof fourteen with his hand grasping a bottle of rum under all the\nturned-up clothes in a chest, he, at the moment of death, being\nevidently intent upon hiding it; and after two hours\' search of the\nship, I got back to my own, and half an hour later came upon all the\nthree missing whale-boats about a mile apart, and steered zig-zag near\nto each. They contained five men each and a steerer, and one had the\nharpoon-gun fired, with the loose line coiled round and round the head\nand upper part of the stroke line-manager; and in the others hundreds of\nfathoms of coiled rope, with toggle-irons, whale-lances, hand-harpoons,\nand dropped heads, and grins, and lazy _abandon_, and eyes that stared,\nand eyes that dozed, and eyes that winked.\n\nAfter this I began to sight ships not infrequently, and used regularly\nto have the three lights burning all night. On the 12th July I met one,\non the 15th two, on the 16th one, on the 17th three, on the 18th\ntwo--all Greenlanders, I think: but, of the nine, I boarded only three,\nthe glass quite clearly showing me, when yet far off, that on the others\nwas no life; and on the three which I boarded were dead men; so that\nthat suspicion which I had, and that fear, grew very heavy upon me.\n\nI went on southward, day after day southward, sentinel there at my\nwheel; clear sunshine by day, when the calm pale sea sometimes seemed\nmixed with regions of milk, and at night the immense desolation of a\nworld lit by a sun that was long dead, and by a light that was gloom. It\nwas like Night blanched in death then; and wan as the very kingdom of\ndeath and Hades I have seen it, most terrifying, that neuter state and\nlimbo of nothingness, when unreal sea and spectral sky, all boundaries\nlost, mingled in a vast shadowy void of ghastly phantasmagoria, pale to\nutter huelessness, at whose centre I, as if annihilated, seemed to swoon\nin immensity of space. Into this disembodied world would come anon\nwaftures of that peachy scent which I knew: and their frequency rapidly\ngrew. But still the _Boreal_ moved, traversing, as it were, bottomless\nEternity: and I reached latitude 72Â°, not far now from Northern Europe.\n\nAnd now, as to that blossomy peach-scent--even while some floes were yet\naround me--I was just like some fantastic mariner, who, having set out\nto search for Eden and the Blessed Islands, finds them, and balmy gales\nfrom their gardens come out, while he is yet afar, to meet him with\ntheir perfumes of almond and champac, cornel and jasmin and lotus. For I\nhad now reached a zone where the peach-aroma was constant; all the world\nseemed embalmed in its spicy fragrance; and I could easily imagine\nmyself voyaging beyond the world toward some clime of perpetual and\nenchanting Spring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I saw at last what whalers used to call \'the blink of the ice\';\nthat is to say, its bright apparition or reflection in the sky when it\nis left behind, or not yet come-to. By this time I was in a region where\na good many craft of various sorts were to be seen; I was continually\nmeeting them; and not one did I omit to investigate, while many I\nboarded in the kayak or the larch-wood pram. Just below latitude 70Â° I\ncame upon a good large fleet of what I supposed to be Lafoden cod and\nherring fishers, which must have drifted somewhat on a northward\ncurrent. They had had a great season, for the boats were well laden with\ncuring fish. I went from one to the other on a zig-zag course, they\nbeing widely scattered, some mere dots to the glass on the horizon. The\nevening was still and clear with that astral Arctic clearness, the sun\njust beginning his low-couched nightly drowse. These sturdy-looking\nbrown boats stood rocking gently there with slow-creaking noises, as of\nthings whining in slumber, without the least damage, awaiting the\nappalling storms of the winter months on that tenebrous sea, when a\ndark doom, and a deep grave, would not fail them. The fishers were braw\ncarles, wearing, many of them, fringes of beard well back from the\nchin-point, with hanging woollen caps. In every case I found below-decks\na number of cruses of corn-brandy, marked _aquavit_, two of which I took\ninto the pram. In one of the smacks an elderly fisher was kneeling in a\nforward sprawling pose, clasping the lug-mast with his arms, the two\nknees wide apart, head thrown back, and the yellow eye-balls with their\nislands of grey iris staring straight up the mast-pole. At another of\nthem, instead of boarding in the pram, I shut off the _Boreal\'s_ liquid\nair at such a point that, by delicate steering, she slackened down to a\nstoppage just a-beam of the smack, upon whose deck I was thus able to\njump down. After looking around I descended the three steps aft into the\ndark and garrety below-decks, and with stooping back went calling in an\nawful whisper: \'_Anyone? Anyone?_\' Nothing answered me: and when I went\nup again, the _Boreal_ had drifted three yards beyond my reach. There\nbeing a dead calm, I had to plunge into the water, and in that\nhalf-minute there a sudden cold throng of unaccountable terrors beset\nme, and I can feel again now that abysmal desolation of loneliness, and\nsense of a hostile and malign universe bent upon eating me up: for the\nocean seemed to me nothing but a great ghost.\n\nTwo mornings later I came upon another school, rather larger boats\nthese, which I found to be Brittany cod-fishers. Most of these, too, I\nboarded. In every below-decks was a wooden or earthenware image of the\nVirgin, painted in gaudy faded colours; and in one case I found a boy\nwho had been kneeling before the statue, but was toppled sideways now,\nhis knees still bent, and the cross of Christ in his hand. These\nstalwart blue woollen blouses and tarpaulin sou\'-westers lay in every\npose of death, every detail of feature and expression still perfectly\npreserved. The sloops were all the same, all, all: with sing-song creaks\nthey rocked a little, nonchalantly: each, as it were, with a certain\nsub-consciousness of its own personality, and callous unconsciousness of\nall the others round it: yet each a copy of the others: the same hooks\nand lines, disembowelling-knives, barrels of salt and pickle, piles and\ncasks of opened cod, kegs of biscuit, and low-creaking rockings, and a\nbilgy smell, and dead men. The next day, about eighty miles south of the\nlatitude of Mount Hekla, I sighted a big ship, which turned out to be\nthe French cruiser _Lazare TrÃ©port_. I boarded and overhauled her\nduring three hours, her upper, main, and armoured deck, deck by deck, to\nher lowest black depths, even childishly spying up the tubes of her two\nbig, rusted turret-guns. Three men in the engine-room had been much\nmangled, after death, I presume, by a burst boiler; floating about 800\nyards to the north-east lay a long-boat of hers, low in the water,\ncrammed with marines, one oar still there, jammed between the row-lock\nand the rower\'s forced-back chin; on the ship\'s starboard deck, in the\nlong stretch of space between the two masts, the blue-jackets had\nevidently been piped up, for they lay there in a sort of serried\ndisorder, to the number of two hundred and seventy-five. Nothing could\nbe of suggestion more tragic than the wasted and helpless power of this\npoor wandering vessel, around whose stolid mass myriads of wavelets,\nbusy as aspen-leaves, bickered with a continual weltering splash that\nwas quite loud to hear. I sat a good time that afternoon in one of her\nsteely port main-deck casemates on a gun-carriage, my head sunken on my\nbreast, furtively eyeing the bluish turned-up feet, all shrunk,\nexsanguined, of a sailor who lay on his back before me; his soles were\nall that I could see, the rest of him lying head-downwards beyond the\nsteel door-sill.\n\nDrenched in seas of lugubrious reverie I sat, till, with a shuddering\nstart, I awoke, paddled back to the _Boreal_, and, till sleep conquered\nme, went on my way. At ten the next morning, coming on deck, I spied to\nthe west a group of craft, and turned my course upon them. They turned\nout to be eight Shetland sixerns, which must have drifted north-eastward\nhither. I examined them well, but they were as the long list of the\nothers: for all the men, and all the boys, and all the dogs on them were\ndead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have come to land a long time before I did: but I would not: I\nwas so afraid. For I was used to the silence of the ice: and I was used\nto the silence of the sea: but, God knows it, I was afraid of the\nsilence of the land.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce, on the 15th July, I had seen a whale, or thought I did, spouting\nvery remotely afar on the S.E. horizon; and on the 19th I distinctly saw\na shoal of porpoises vaulting the sea-surface, in their swift-successive\nmanner, northward: and seeing them, I had said pitifully to myself:\n\'Well, I am not quite alone in the world, then, my good God--not quite\nalone.\'\n\nMoreover, some days later, the _Boreal_ had found herself in a bank of\ncod making away northward, millions of fish, for I saw them, and one\nafternoon caught three, hand-running, with the hook.\n\nSo the sea, at least, had its tribes to be my mates.\n\nBut if I should find the land as still as the sea, without even the\nspouting whale, or school of tumbling sea-hogs--_if Paris were dumber\nthan the eternal ice_--what then, I asked myself, should I do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have made short work, and landed at Shetland, for I found myself\nas far westward as longitude 11Â° 23\' W.: but I would not: I was so\nafraid. The shrinking within me to face that vague suspicion which I\nhad, turned me first to a foreign land.\n\nI made for Norway, and on the first night of this definite intention, at\nabout nine o\'clock, the weather being gusty, the sky lowering, the air\nsombrous, and the sea hard-looking, dark, and ridged, I was steaming\nalong at a good rate, holding the wheel, my poor port and starboard\nlights still burning there, when, without the least notice, I received\nthe roughest physical shock of my life, being shot bodily right over\nthe wheel, thence, as from a cannon, twenty feet to the cabin-door,\nthrough it head-foremost down the companion-way, and still beyond some\nsix yards along the passage. I had crashed into some dark and dead ship,\nprobably of large size, though I never saw her, nor any sign of her; and\nall that night, and the next day till four in the afternoon, the\n_Boreal_ went driving alone over the sea, whither she would: for I lay\nunconscious. When I woke, I found that I had received really very small\ninjuries, considering: but I sat there on the floor a long time in a\nsulky, morose, disgusted, and bitter mood; and when I rose, pettishly\nstopped the ship\'s engines, seeing my twelve dead all huddled and\ndisfigured. Now I was afraid to steam by night, and even in the daytime\nI would not go on for three days: for I was childishly angry with I know\nnot what, and inclined to quarrel with Those whom I could not see.\n\nHowever, on the fourth day, a rough swell which knocked the ship about,\nand made me very uncomfortable, coaxed me into moving; and I did so with\nbows turned eastward and southward.\n\nI sighted the Norway coast four days later, in latitude 63Â° 19\', at noon\nof the 11th August, and pricked off my course to follow it; but it was\nwith a slow and dawdling reluctance that I went, at much less than\nhalf-speed. In some eight hours, as I knew from the chart, I ought to\nsight the lighthouse light on Smoelen Island; and when quiet night came,\nthe black water being branded with trails of still moonlight, I passed\nquite close to it, between ten and twelve, almost under the shadow of\nthe mighty hills: but, oh my God, no light was there. And all the way\ndown I marked the rugged sea-board slumber darkling, afar or near, with\nnever, alas! one friendly light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, on the 15th August I had another of those maniac raptures, whose\npassing away would have left an elephant racked and prostrate. During\nfour days I had seen not one sign of present life on the Norway coast,\nonly hills, hills, dead and dark, and floating craft, all dead and dark;\nand my eyes now, I found, had acquired a crazy fixity of stare into the\nvery bottom of the vacant abyss of nothingness, while I remained\nunconscious of being, save of one point, rainbow-blue, far down in the\ninfinite, which passed slowly from left to right before my consciousness\na little way, then vanished, came back, and passed slowly again, from\nleft to right continually; till some prick, or voice, in my brain would\nstartle me into the consciousness that I was staring, whispering the\nprofound confidential warning: _You must not stare so, or it is over\nwith you!_\' Well, lost in a blank trance of this sort, I was leaning\nover the wheel during the afternoon of the 15th, when it was as if some\ninstinct or premonition in my soul leapt up, and said aloud: \'If you\nlook just yonder, _you will see...!_\' I started, and in one instant had\nsurged up from all that depth of reverie to reality: I glanced to the\nright: and there, at last, my God, I saw something human which moved,\nrapidly moved: at last!--and it came to me.\n\nThat sense of recovery, of waking, of new solidity, of the comfortable\nusual, a million-fold too intense for words--how sweetly consoling it\nwas! Again now, as I write, I can fancy and feel it--the rocky solidity,\nthe adamant ordinary, on which to base the feet, and live. From the day\nwhen I stood at the Pole, and saw there the dizzy thing that made me\nswoon, there had come into my way not one sign or trace that other\nbeings like myself were alive on the earth with me: till now, suddenly,\nI had the sweet indubitable proof: for on the south-western sea, not\nfour knots away, I saw a large, swift ship: and her bows, which were\nsharp as a hatchet, were steadily chipping through the smooth sea at a\npretty high pace, throwing out profuse ribbony foams that went\nwide-vawering, with outward undulations, far behind her length, as she\nran the sea in haste, straight northward.\n\nAt the moment, I was steering about S.E. by S., fifteen miles out from a\nshadowy-blue series of Norway mountains; and just giving the wheel one\nfrantic spin to starboard to bring me down upon her, I flew to the\nbridge, leant my back on the main-mast, which passed through it, put a\nfoot on the white iron rail before me, and there at once felt all the\nmocking devils of distracted revelry possess me, as I caught the cap\nfrom my long hairs, and commenced to wave and wave and wave, red-faced\nmaniac that I was: for at the second nearer glance, I saw that she was\nflying an ensign at the main, and a long pennant at the main-top, and I\ndid not know what she was flying those flags there for: and I was\nembittered and driven mad.\n\nWith distinct minuteness did she print herself upon my consciousness in\nthat five minutes\' interval: she was painted a dull and cholera yellow,\nlike many Russian ships, and there was a faded pink space at her bows\nunder the line where the yellow ceased: the ensign at her main I made\nout to be the blue-and-white saltire, and she was clearly a Russian\npassenger-liner, two-masted, two-funnelled, though from her funnels came\nno trace of smoke, and the position of her steam-cones was anywhere. All\nabout her course the sea was spotted with wobbling splendours of the low\nsun, large coarse blots of glory near the eye, but lessening to a\nsmaller pattern in the distance, and at the horizon refined to a\nhomogeneous band of livid silver.\n\nThe double speed of the _Boreal_ and the other, hastening opposite ways,\nmust have been thirty-eight or forty knots, and the meeting was\naccomplished in certainly less than five minutes: yet into that time I\ncrowded years of life. I was shouting passionately at her, my eyes\nstarting from my head, my face all inflamed with rage the most prone,\nloud and urgent. For she did not stop, nor signal, nor make sign of\nseeing me, but came furrowing down upon me like Juggernaut, with\nsteadfast run. I lost reason, thought, memory, purpose, sense of\nrelation, in that access of delirium which transported me, and can only\nremember now that in the midst of my shouting, a word, uttered by the\nfiends who used my throat to express their frenzy, set me laughing high\nand madly: for I was crying: \'Hi! Bravo! Why don\'t you stop? _Madmen! I\nhave been to the Pole!\'_\n\nThat instant an odour arose, and came, and struck upon my brain, most\ndetestable, most execrable; and while one might count ten, I was aware\nof her near-sounding engines, and that cursed charnel went tearing past\nme on her maenad way, not fifteen yards from my eyes and nostrils. She\nwas a thing, my God, from which the vulture and the jackal, prowling for\noffal, would fly with shrieks of loathing. I had a glimpse of decks\npiled thick with her festered dead.\n\nIn big black letters on the round retreating yellow stern my eye-corner\ncaught the word _Yaroslav_, as I bent over the rail to retch and cough\nand vomit at her. She was a horrid thing.\n\nThis ship had certainly been pretty far south in tropical or\nsub-tropical latitudes with her great crowd of dead: for all the bodies\nwhich I had seen till then, so far from smelling ill, seemed to give out\na certain perfume of the peach. She was evidently one of those many\nships of late years which have substituted liquid air for steam, yet\nretained their old steam-funnels, &c., in case of emergency: for air, I\nbelieve, was still looked at askance by several builders, on account of\nthe terrible accidents which it sometimes caused. The _Boreal_ herself\nis a similar instance of both motors. This vessel, the _Yaroslav_, must\nhave been left with working engines when her crew were overtaken by\ndeath, and, her air-tanks being still unexhausted, must have been\nranging the ocean with impunity ever since, during I knew not how many\nmonths, or, it might be, years.\n\nWell, I coasted Norway for nearly a hundred and sixty miles without once\ngoing nearer land than two or three miles: for something held me back.\nBut passing the fjord-mouth where I knew that Aadheim was, I suddenly\nturned the helm to port, almost before I knew that I was doing it, and\nmade for land.\n\nIn half an hour I was moving up an opening in the land with mountains on\neither hand, streaky crags at their summit, umbrageous boscage below;\nand the whole softened, as it were, by veils woven of the rainbow.\n\nThis arm of water lies curved about like a thread which one drops, only\nthe curves are much more pointed, so that every few minutes the scene\nwas changed, though the vessel just crawled her way up, and I could see\nbehind me nothing of what was passed, or only a land-locked gleam like a\nlake.\n\nI never saw water so polished and glassy, like clarid polished marble,\nreflecting everything quite clean-cut in its lucid abysm, over which\nhardly the faintest zephyr breathed that still sun-down; it wimpled\nabout the bluff _Boreal_, which seemed to move as if careful not to\nbruise it, in rich wrinkles and creases, like glycerine, or\ndewy-trickling lotus-oil; yet it was only the sea: and the spectacle\nyonder was only crags, and autumn-foliage and mountain-slope: yet all\nseemed caught-up and chaste, rapt in a trance of rose and purple, and\nmade of the stuff of dreams and bubbles, of pollen-of-flowers, and rinds\nof the peach.\n\nI saw it not only with delight, but with complete astonishment: having\nforgotten, as was too natural in all that long barrenness of ice and\nsea, that anything could be so ethereally fair: yet homely, too, human,\nfamiliar, and consoling. The air here was richly spiced with that peachy\nscent, and there was a Sabbath and a nepenthe and a charm in that place\nat that hour, as it were of those gardens of Hesperus, and fields of\nasphodel, reserved for the spirits of the just.\n\nAlas! but I had the glass at my side, and for me nepenthe was mixed with\na despair immense as the vault of heaven, my good God: for anon I would\ntake it up to spy some perched hut of the peasant, or burg of the\n\'bonder,\' on the peaks: and I saw no one there; and to the left, at the\nthird marked bend of the fjord, where there is one of those watch-towers\nthat these people used for watching in-coming fish, I spied, lying on a\ncraggy slope just before the tower, a body which looked as if it must\nsurely tumble head-long, but did not. And when I saw that, I felt\ndefinitely, for the first time, that shoreless despair which I alone of\nmen have felt, high beyond the stars, and deep as hell; and I fell to\nstaring again that blank stare of Nirvana and the lunacy of Nothingness,\nwherein Time merges in Eternity, and all being, like one drop of water,\nflies scattered to fill the bottomless void of space, and is lost.\n\nThe _Boreal\'s_ bow walking over a little empty fishing-boat roused me,\nand a minute later, just before I came to a new promontory and bend, I\nsaw two people. The shore there is some three feet above the water, and\nedged with boulders of rock, about which grows a fringe of shrubs and\nsmall trees: behind this fringe is a path, curving upward through a\nsombre wooded little gorge; and on the path, near the water, I saw a\ndriver of one of those Norwegian sulkies that were called karjolers: he,\non the high front seat, was dead, lying sideways and backwards, with low\nhead resting on the wheel; and on a trunk strapped to a frame on the\naxle behind was a boy, his head, too, resting sideways on the wheel,\nnear the other\'s; and the little pony was dead, pitched forward on its\nhead and fore-knees, tilting the shafts downward; and some distance from\nthem on the water floated an empty skiff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I turned the next fore-land, I all at once began to see a number of\ncraft, which increased as I advanced, most of them small boats, with\nsome schooners, sloops, and larger craft, the majority a-ground: and\nsuddenly now I was conscious that, mingling with that delicious odour of\nspring-blossoms--profoundly modifying, yet not destroying it--was\nanother odour, wafted to me on the wings of the very faint land-breeze:\nand \'Man,\' I said, \'is decomposing\': for I knew it well: it was the\nodour of human corruption.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fjord opened finally in a somewhat wider basin, shut-in by quite\nsteep, high-towering mountains, which reflected themselves in the water\nto their last cloudy crag: and, at the end of this I saw ships, a quay,\nand a modest, homely old town.\n\nNot a sound, not one: only the languidly-working engines of the\n_Boreal_. Here, it was clear, the Angel of Silence had passed, and his\nscythe mown.\n\nI ran and stopped the engines, and, without anchoring, got down into an\nempty boat that lay at the ship\'s side when she stopped; and I paddled\ntwenty yards toward the little quay. There was a brigantine with all her\ncourses set, three jibs, stay-sails, square-sails, main and fore-sails,\nand gaff-top-sail, looking hanging and listless in that calm place, and\nwedded to a still copy of herself, mast-downward, in the water; there\nwere three lumber-schooners, a forty-ton steam-boat, a tiny barque, five\nNorway herring-fishers, and ten or twelve shallops: and the\nsailing-craft had all fore-and-aft sails set, and about each, as I\npassed among them, brooded an odour that was both sweet and abhorrent,\nan odour more suggestive of the very genius of mortality--the inner mind\nand meaning of Azrael--than aught that I could have conceived: for all,\nas I soon saw, were crowded with dead.\n\nWell, I went up the old mossed steps, in that strange dazed state in\nwhich one notices frivolous things: I remember, for instance, feeling\nthe lightness of my new clothes: for the weather was quite mild, and the\nday before I had changed to Summer things, having on now only a common\nundyed woollen shirt, the sleeves rolled up, and cord trousers, with a\nbelt, and a cloth cap over my long hair, and an old pair of yellow\nshoes, without laces, and without socks. And I stood on the unhewn\nstones of the edge of the quay, and looked abroad over a largish piece\nof unpaved ground, which lay between the first house-row and the quay.\n\nWhat I saw was not only most woeful, but wildly startling: woeful,\nbecause a great crowd of people had assembled, and lay dead, there; and\nwildly startling, because something in their _tout ensemble_ told me in\none minute why they were there in such number.\n\nThey were there in the hope, and with the thought, to fly westward by\nboat.\n\nAnd the something which told me this was a certain _foreign_ air about\nthat field of the dead as the eye rested on it, something un-northern,\nsouthern, and Oriental.\n\nTwo yards from my feet, as I stepped to the top, lay a group of three:\none a Norway peasant-girl in skirt of olive-green, scarlet stomacher,\nembroidered bodice, Scotch bonnet trimmed with silver lace, and big\nsilver shoe-buckles; the second was an old Norway man in knee-breeches,\nand eighteenth-century small-clothes, and red worsted cap; and the third\nwas, I decided, an old Jew of the Polish Pale, in gaberdine and\nskull-cap, with ear-locks.\n\nI went nearer to where they lay thick as reaped stubble between the\nquay and a little stone fountain in the middle of the space, and I saw\namong those northern dead two dark-skinned women in costly dress, either\nSpanish or Italian, and the yellower mortality of a Mongolian, probably\na Magyar, and a big negro in zouave dress, and some twenty-five obvious\nFrench, and two Morocco fezes, and the green turban of a shereef, and\nthe white of an Ulema.\n\nAnd I asked myself this question: \'How came these foreign stragglers\nhere in this obscure northern town?\'\n\nAnd my wild heart answered: \'There has been an impassioned stampede,\nnorthward and westward, of all the tribes of Man. And this that I, Adam\nJeffson, here see is but the far-tossed spray of that monstrous,\ninfuriate flood.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I passed up a street before me, careful, careful where I trod. It\nwas not utterly silent, nor was the quay-square, but haunted by a pretty\ndense cloud of mosquitoes, and dreamy twinges of music, like the drawing\nof the violin-bow in elf-land. The street was narrow, pavered, steep,\nand dark; and the sensations with which I, poor bent man, passed\nthrough that dead town, only Atlas, fabled to bear the burden of this\nEarth, could divine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought to myself: If now a wave from the Deep has washed over this\nplanetary ship of earth, and I, who alone happened to be in the extreme\nbows, am the sole survivor of that crew?... What then, my God, shall I\ndo?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt, I felt, that in this townlet, save the water-gnats of Norway,\nwas no living thing; that the hum and the savour of Eternity filled, and\nwrapped, and embalmed it.\n\nThe houses are mostly of wood, some of them fairly large, with a\n_porte-cochÃ¨re_ leading into a semi-circular yard, around which the\nbuilding stands, very steep-roofed, and shingled, in view of the heavy\nsnow-masses of winter. Glancing into one open casement near the ground,\nI saw an aged woman, stout and capped, lie on her face before a very\nlarge porcelain stove; but I paced on without stoppage, traversed\nseveral streets, and came out, as it became dark, upon a piece of\ngrass-land leading downward to a mountain-gorge. It was some distance\nalong this gorge that I found myself sitting the next morning: and how,\nand in what trance, I passed that whole blank night is obliterated from\nmy consciousness. When I looked about with the return of light I saw\nmajestic fir-grown mountains on either hand, almost meeting overhead at\nsome points, deeply shading the mossy gorge. I rose, and careless of\ndirection, went still onward, and walked and walked for hours,\nunconscious of hunger; there was a profusion of wild\nmountain-strawberries, very tiny, which must grow almost into winter, a\nfew of which I ate; there were blue gentianellas, and\nlilies-of-the-valley, and luxuriance of verdure, and a noise of waters.\nOccasionally, I saw little cataracts on high, fluttering like white wild\nrags, for they broke in the mid-fall, and were caught away, and\nscattered; patches also of reaped hay and barley, hung up, in a singular\nway, on stakes six feet high, I suppose to dry; there were perched huts,\nand a seemingly inaccessible small castle or burg, but none of these did\nI enter: and five bodies only I saw in the gorge, a woman with a babe,\nand a man with two small oxen.\n\nAbout three in the afternoon I was startled to find myself there, and\nturned back. It was dark when I again passed through those gloomy\nstreets of Aadheim, making for the quay, and now I felt both my hunger\nand a dropping weariness. I had no thought of entering any house, but\nas I passed by one open _porte-cochÃ¨re_, something, I know not what,\nmade me turn sharply in, for my mind had become as fluff on the winds,\nnot working of its own action, but the sport of impulses that seemed\nexternal. I went across the yard, and ascended a wooden spiral stair by\na twilight which just enabled me to pick my way among five or six vague\nforms fallen there. In that confined place fantastic qualms beset me; I\nmounted to the first landing, and tried the door, but it was locked; I\nmounted to the second: the door was open, and with a chill reluctance I\ntook a step inward where all was pitch darkness, the window-stores being\ndrawn. I hesitated: it was very dark. I tried to utter that word of\nmine, but it came in a whisper inaudible to my ears: I tried again, and\nthis time heard myself say: \'_anyone_?\' At the same time I had made\nanother step forward, and trodden upon a soft abdomen; and at that\ncontact terrors the most cold and ghastly thrilled me through and\nthrough, for it was as though I saw in that darkness the sudden eyeballs\nof Hell and frenzy glare upon me, and with a low gurgle of affright I\nwas gone, helter-skelter down the stairs, treading upon flesh, across\nthe yard, and down the street, with pelting feet, and open arms, and\nsobbing bosom, for I thought that all Aadheim was after me; nor was my\nhorrid haste appeased till I was on board the _Boreal_, and moving down\nthe fjord.\n\nOut to sea, then, I went again; and within the next few days I visited\nBergen, and put in at Stavanger. And I saw that Bergen and Stavanger\nwere dead.\n\nIt was then, on the 19th August, that I turned my bow toward my native\nland.\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom Stavanger I steered a straight course for the Humber.\n\nI had no sooner left behind me the Norway coast than I began to meet the\nships, the ships--ship after ship; and by the time I entered the zone\nof the ordinary alternation of sunny day and sunless night, I was moving\nthrough the midst of an incredible number of craft, a mighty and\nwide-spread fleet.\n\nOver all that great expanse of the North Sea, where, in its most\npopulous days of trade, the sailor might perhaps sight a sail or two, I\nhad now at every moment at least ten or twelve within scope of the\nglass, oftentimes as many as forty, forty-five.\n\nAnd very still they lay on a still sea, itself a dead thing, livid as\nthe lips of death; and there was an intensity in the calm that was\nappalling: for the ocean seemed weighted, and the air drugged.\n\nExtremely slow was my advance, for at first I would not leave any ship,\nhowever remotely small, without approaching sufficiently to investigate\nher, at least with the spy-glass: and a strange multitudinous mixture of\nspecies they were, trawlers in hosts, war-ships of every nation, used,\nit seemed, as passenger-boats, smacks, feluccas, liners, steam-barges,\ngreat four-masters with sails, Channel boats, luggers, a Venetian\n_burchiello_, colliers, yachts, _remorqueurs_, training ships, dredgers,\ntwo _dahabeeahs_ with curving gaffs, Marseilles fishers, a Maltese\n_speronare_, American off-shore sail, Mississippi steam-boats, Sorrento\nlug-schooners, Rhine punts, yawls, old frigates and three-deckers,\ncalled to novel use, Stromboli caiques, Yarmouth tubs, xebecs, Rotterdam\nflat-bottoms, floats, mere gunwaled rafts--anything from anywhere that\ncould bear a human freight on water had come, and was here: and all, I\nknew, had been making westward, or northward, or both; and all, I knew,\nwere crowded; and all were tombs, listlessly wandering, my God, on the\nwandering sea with their dead.\n\nAnd so fair was the world about them, too: the brightest suavest autumn\nweather; all the still air aromatic with that vernal perfume of peach:\nyet not so utterly still, but if I passed close to the lee of any\nfloating thing, the spicy stirrings of morning or evening wafted me\nfaint puffs of the odour of mortality over-ripe for the grave.\n\nSo abominable and accursed did this become to me, such a plague and a\nhissing, vague as was the offence, that I began to shun rather than seek\nthe ships, and also I now dropped my twelve, whom I had kept to be my\ncompanions all the way from the Far North, one by one, into the sea: for\nnow I had definitely passed into a zone of settled warmth.\n\nI was convinced, however, that the poison, whatever it might be, had\nsome embalming, or antiseptic, effect upon the bodies: at Aadheim,\nBergen and Stavanger, for instance, where the temperature permitted me\nto go without a jacket, only the merest hints and whiffs of the\nprocesses of dissolution had troubled me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVery benign, I say, and pleasant to see, was sky and sea during all that\nvoyage: but it was at sun-set that my sense of the wondrously beautiful\nwas roused and excited, in spite of that great burden which I carried.\nCertainly, I never saw sun-sets resembling those, nor could have\nconceived of aught so flamboyant, extravagant, and bewitched: for the\nwhole heaven seemed turned into an arena for warring Hierarchies,\nwarring for the universe, or it was like the wild countenance of God\ndefeated, and flying marred and bloody from His enemies. But many\nevenings I watched with unintelligent awe, believing it but a portent of\nthe un-sheathed sword of the Almighty; till, one morning, a thought\npricked me like a sword, for I suddenly remembered the great sun-sets of\nthe later nineteenth century, witnessed in Europe, America, and, I\nbelieve, over the world, after the eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa.\n\nAnd whereas I had before said to myself: \'If now a wave from the Deep\nhas washed over this planetary ship of earth...,\' I said now: \'A\nwave--but not from the Deep: a wave rather which she had reserved, and\nhas spouted, from her own un-motherly entrails...\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had some knowledge of Morse telegraphy, and of the manipulation of\ntape-machines, telegraphic typing-machines, and the ordinary wireless\ntransmitter and coherer, as of most little things of that sort which\ncame within the outskirts of the interest of a man of science; I had\ncollaborated with Professor Stanistreet in the production of a text-book\ncalled \'Applications of Science to the Arts,\' which had brought us some\nnotoriety; and, on the whole, the _minutiae_ of modern things were\nstill pretty fresh in my memory. I could therefore have wired from\nBergen or Stavanger, supposing the batteries not run down, to somewhere:\nbut I would not: I was so afraid; afraid lest for ever from nowhere\nshould come one answering click, or flash, or stirring....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have made short work, and landed at Hull: but I would not: I was\nso afraid. For I was used to the silence of the ice: and I was used to\nthe silence of the sea: but I was afraid of the silence of England.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI came in sight of the coast on the morning of the 26th August,\nsomewhere about Hornsea, but did not see any town, for I put the helm to\nport, and went on further south, no longer bothering with the\ninstruments, but coasting at hap-hazard, now in sight of land, and now\nin the centre of a circle of sea; not admitting to myself the motive of\nthis loitering slowness, nor thinking at all, but ignoring the\ndeep-buried fear of the to-morrow which I shirked, and instinctively\nhiding myself in to-day. I passed the Wash, I passed Yarmouth,\nFelixstowe. By now the things that floated motionless on the sea were\nbeyond numbering, for I could hardly lower my eyes ten minutes and lift\nthem, without seeing yet another there: so that soon after dusk I, too,\nhad to lie still among them all, till morning: for they lay dark, and to\nmove at any pace would have been to drown the already dead.\n\nWell, I came to the Thames-mouth, and lay pretty well in among the Flats\nand Pan Sands towards eight one evening, not seven miles from Sheppey\nand the North Kent coast: and I did not see any Nore Light, nor Girdler\nLight: and all along the coast I had seen no light: but as to that I\nsaid not one word to myself, not admitting it, nor letting my heart know\nwhat my brain thought, nor my brain know what my heart surmised; but\nwith a daft and mock-mistrustful under-look I would regard the darkling\nland, holding it a sentient thing that would be playing a prank upon a\npoor man like me.\n\nAnd the next morning, when I moved again, my furtive eye-corners were\nvery well aware of the Prince\'s Channel light-ship, and also the Tongue\nship, for there they were: but I would not look at them at all, nor go\nnear them: for I did not wish to have anything to do with whatever might\nhave happened beyond my own ken, and it was better to look straight\nbefore, seeing nothing, and concerning one\'s-self with one\'s-self.\n\nThe next evening, after having gone out to sea again, I was in a little\nto the E. by S. of the North Foreland: and I saw no light there, nor any\nSandhead light; but over the sea vast signs of wreckage, and the coasts\nwere strewn with old wrecked fleets. I turned about S.E., very slowly\nmoving--for anywhere hereabouts hundreds upon hundreds of craft lay dead\nwithin a ten-mile circle of sea--and by two in the fore-day had wandered\nup well in sight of the French cliffs: for I had said: \'I will go and\nsee the light-beam of the great revolving-drum on Calais pier that\nnightly beams half-way over-sea to England.\' And the moon shone clear in\nthe southern heaven that morning, like a great old dying queen whose\nCourt swarms distantly from around her, diffident, pale, and tremulous,\nthe paler the nearer; and I could see the mountain-shadows on her spotty\nfull-face, and her misty aureole, and her lights on the sea, as it were\nkisses stolen in the kingdom of sleep; and all among the quiet ships\nmysterious white trails and powderings of light, like palace-corridors\nin some fairy-land forlorn, full of breathless wan whispers, scandals,\nand runnings-to-and-fro, with leers, and agitated last embraces, and\nflight of the princess, and death-bed of the king; and on the N.E.\nhorizon a bank of brown cloud that seemed to have no relation with the\nworld; and yonder, not far, the white coast-cliffs, not so low as at\nCalais near, but arranged in masses separated by vales of sward, each\nwith its wreck: but no light of any revolving-drum I saw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could not sleep that night: for all the operations of my mind and body\nseemed in abeyance. Mechanically I turned the ship westward again; and\nwhen the sun came up, there, hardly two miles from me, were the cliffs\nof Dover; and on the crenulated summit of the Castle I spied the Union\nJack hang motionless.\n\nI heard eight, nine o\'clock strike in the cabin, and I was still at sea.\nBut some mad, audacious whisper was at my brain: and at 10.30, the 2nd\nSeptember, immediately opposite the Cross Wall Custom House, the\n_Boreal\'s_ anchor-chain, after a voyage of three years, two months, and\nfourteen days, ran thundering, thundering, through the starboard\nhawse-hole.\n\nAh heaven! but I must have been stark mad to let the anchor go! for the\neffect upon me of that shocking obstreperous hubbub, breaking in upon\nall that cemetery repose that blessed morning, and lasting it seemed a\nyear, was most appalling; and at the sudden racket I stood excruciated,\nwith shivering knees and flinching heart, God knows: for not less\nterrifically uproarious than the clatter of the last Trump it raged and\nraged, and I thought that all the billion dead could not fail to start,\nand rise, at alarum so excessive, and question me with their eyes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the top of the Cross Wall near I saw a grey crab fearlessly crawl; at\nthe end where the street begins, I saw a single gas-light palely burn\nthat broad day, and at its foot a black man lay on his face, clad only\nin a shirt and one boot; the harbour was almost packed with every sort\nof craft, and on a Calais-Dover boat, eight yards from my stern, which\nmust have left Calais crowded to suffocation, I saw the rotted dead lie\nheaped, she being unmoored, and continually grinding against an anchored\ngreen brig.\n\nAnd when I saw that, I dropped down upon my knees at the capstan, and my\npoor heart sobbed out the frail cry: \'Well, Lord God, Thou hast\ndestroyed the work of Thy hand...\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a time I got up, went below in a state of somnambulism, took a\npacket of pemmican cakes, leapt to land, and went following the railway\nthat runs from the Admiralty Pier. In an enclosed passage ten yards\nlong, with railway masonry on one side, I saw five dead lie, and could\nnot believe that I was in England, for all were dark-skinned people,\nthree gaudily dressed, and two in flowing white robes. It was the same\nwhen I turned into a long street, leading northward, for here were a\nhundred, or more, and never saw I, except in Constantinople, where I\nonce lived eighteen months, so variegated a mixture of races, black,\nbrunette, brown, yellow, white, in all the shades, some emaciated like\npeople dead from hunger, and, overlooking them all, one English boy with\na clean Eton collar sitting on a bicycle, supported by a lamp-post which\nhis arms clasped, he proving clearly the extraordinary suddenness of the\ndeath which had overtaken them all.\n\nI did not know whither, nor why, I went, nor had I the least idea\nwhether all this was visually seen by me in the world which I had known,\nor in some other, or was all phantasy of my disembodied spirit--for I\nhad the thought that I, too, might be dead since old ages, and my spirit\nwandering now through the universe of space, in which there is neither\nnorth nor south, nor up nor down, nor measure nor relation, nor aught\nwhatever, save an uneasy consciousness of a dream about bottomlessness.\nOf grief or pain, I think, I felt nothing; though I have a sort of\nmemory now that some sound, resembling a sob or groan, though it was\nneither, came at regular clockwork intervals from my bosom during three\nor four days. Meantime, my brain registered like a tape-machine details\nthe most frivolous, the most ludicrous--the name of a street, Strond\nStreet, Snargate Street; the round fur cap--black fur for the side,\nwhite ermine for the top--of a portly Karaite priest on his back, whose\nrobes had been blown to his spread knees, as if lifted and neatly folded\nthere; a violin-bow gripped between the thick, irregular teeth of a\nlittle Spaniard with brushed-back hair and mad-looking eyes; odd shoes\non the foot of a French girl, one black, one brown. They lay in the\nstreet about as numerous as gunners who fall round their carriage, at\nintervals of five to ten feet, the majority--as was the case also in\nNorway, and on the ships--in poses of distraction, with spread arms, or\nwildly distorted limbs, like men who, the instant before death, called\nupon the rocks and hills to cover them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the left I came to an opening in the land, called, I believe, \'The\nShaft,\' and into this I turned, climbing a very great number of steps,\nalmost covered at one point with dead: the steps I began to count, but\nleft off, then the dead, and left off. Finally, at the top, which must\nbe even higher than the Castle, I came to a great open space laid out\nwith gravel-walks, and saw fortifications, barracks, a citadel. I did\nnot know the town, except by passings-through, and was surprised at the\nbreadth of view. Between me and the Castle to the east lay the district\nof crowding houses, brick and ragstone, mixed in the distance with vague\nazure haze; and to the right the harbour, the sea, with their ships; and\nvisible around me on the heights seven or eight dead, biting the dust;\nthe sun now high and warm, with hardly a cloud in the sky; and yonder a\nmist, which was the coast of France.\n\nIt seemed too big for one poor man.\n\nMy head nodded. I sat on a bench, black-painted and hard, the seat and\nback of horizontal boards, with intervals; and as I looked, I nodded,\nheavy-headed and weary: for it was too big for me. And as I nodded, with\nforehead propped on my left hand, and the packet of pemmican cakes in my\nright, there was in my head, somehow, an old street-song of my\nchildhood: and I groaned it sleepily, like coronachs and drear funereal\nnenias, dirging; and the packet beat time in my right hand, falling and\nraising, falling heavily and rising, in time.\n\n    I\'ll buy the ring,\n    You\'ll rear the kids:\n    Servants to wait on our ting, ting, ting.\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    Ting, ting,\n    Won\'t we be happy?\n    Ting, ting,\n    That shall be it:\n    I\'ll buy the ring,\n    You\'ll rear the kids:\n    Servants to wait on our ting, ting, ting.\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    .   .   .   .   .\n\nSo maundering, I fell forward upon my face, and for twenty-three hours,\nthe living undistinguished from the dead, I slept there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was awakened by drizzle, leapt up, looked at a silver chronometer\nwhich, attached by a leather to my belt, I carried in my\nbreeches-pocket, and saw that it was 10 A.M. The sky was dark, and a\nmoaning wind--almost a new thing now to me--had arisen.\n\nI ate some pemmican, for I had a reluctance--needless as it turned\nout--to touch any of the thousand luxuries here, sufficient no doubt,\nin a town like Dover alone, to last me five or six hundred years, if I\ncould live so long; and, having eaten, I descended The Shaft, and spent\nthe whole day, though it rained and blustered continually, in wandering\nabout. Reasoning, in my numb way, from the number of ships on the sea, I\nexpected to find the town over-crowded with dead: but this was not so;\nand I should say, at a venture, that not a thousand English, nor fifteen\nthousand foreigners, were in it: for that westward rage and stampede\nmust have operated here also, leaving the town empty but for the ever\nnew-coming hosts.\n\nThe first thing which I did was to go into an open grocer\'s shop, which\nwas also a post and telegraph office, with the notion, I suppose, to get\na message through to London. In the shop a single gas-light was burning\nits last, and this, with that near the pier, were the only two that I\nsaw: and ghastly enough they looked, transparently wannish, and as it\nwere ashamed, like blinking night-things overtaken by the glare of day.\nI conjectured that they had so burned and watched during months, or\nyears: for they were now blazing diminished, with streaks and rays in\nthe flame, as if by effort, and if these were the only two, they must\nhave needed time to all-but exhaust the works. Before the counter lay a\nfashionably-dressed negro with a number of tied parcels scattered about\nhim, and on the counter an empty till, and behind it a tall thin woman\nwith her face resting sideways in the till, fingers clutching the outer\ncounter-rim, and such an expression of frantic terror as I never saw. I\ngot over the counter to a table behind a wire-gauze, and, like a numb\nfool, went over the Morse alphabet in my mind before touching the\ntransmitting key, though I knew no code-words, and there, big enough to\nbe seen, was the ABC dial, and who was to answer my message I did not\nask myself: for habit was still strong upon me, and my mind refused to\nreason from what I saw to what I did not see; but the moment I touched\nthe key, and peered greedily at the galvanometer-needle at my right, I\nsaw that it did not move, for no current was passing; and with a kind of\nfright, I was up, leapt, and got away from the place, though there was a\ngreat number of telegrams about the receiver which, if I had been in my\nsenses, I would have stopped and read.\n\nTurning the corner of the next street, I saw wide-open the door of a\nsubstantial large house, and went in. From bottom to top there was no\none there, except one English girl, sitting back in an easy-chair in the\ndrawing-room, which was richly furnished with Valenciennes curtains and\nazure-satin things. She was a girl of the lowest class, hardly clad in\nblack rags, and there she lay with hanging jaw, in a very crooked and\nawkward pose, a jemmy at her feet, in her left hand a roll of\nbank-notes, and in her lap three watches. In fact, the bodies which I\nsaw here were, in general, either those of new-come foreigners, or else\nof the very poor, the very old, or the very young.\n\nBut what made me remember this house was that I found here on one of the\nsofas a newspaper: _The Kent Express_; and sitting unconscious of my\ndead neighbour, I pored a long while over what was written there.\n\nIt said in a passage which I tore out and kept:\n\n\'Telegraphic communication with Tilsit, Insterburg, Warsaw, Cracow,\nPrzemysl, Gross Wardein, Karlsburg, and many smaller towns lying\nimmediately eastward of the 21st parallel of longitude has ceased during\nthe night. In some at least of them there must have been operators still\nat their duty, undrawn into the great westward-rushing torrent: but as\nall messages from Western Europe have been answered only by that dread\nmysterious silence which, just three months and two days since,\nastounded the world in the case of Eastern New Zealand, we can only\nassume that these towns, too, have been added to the long and mournful\nlist; indeed, after last evening\'s Paris telegrams we might have\nprophesied with some certainty, not merely their overthrow, but even the\nhour of it: for the rate-uniformity of the slow-riding vapour which is\ntouring our globe is no longer doubtful, and has even been definitely\nfixed by Professor Craven at 100-1/2 miles per day, or 4 miles 330 yards\nper hour. Its nature, its origin, remains, of course, nothing but matter\nof conjecture: for it leaves no living thing behind it: nor, God knows,\nis that of any moment now to us who remain. The rumour that it is\nassociated with an odour of almonds is declared, on high authority, to\nbe improbable; but the morose purple of its impending gloom has been\nattested by tardy fugitives from the face of its rolling and smoky\nmarch.\n\n\'Is this the end? We do not, and cannot, believe it. Will the pure sky\nwhich we to-day see above us be invaded in nine days, or less, by this\nsmoke of the Pit of Darkness? In spite of the assurances of the\nscientists, we still doubt. For, if so, to what purpose that long drama\nof History, in which we seem to see the Hand of the Dramaturgist?\nSurely, the end of a Fifth Act should be obvious, satisfying to one\'s\nsense of the complete: but History, so far, long as it has been,\nresembles rather a Prologue than a Fifth Act. Can it be that the\nManager, utterly dissatisfied, would sweep all off, and \'hang up\' the\npiece for ever? Certainly, the sins of mankind have been as scarlet: and\nif the fair earth which he has turned into Hell, send forth now upon him\nthe smoke of Hell, little the wonder. But we cannot yet believe. There\nis a sparing strain in nature, and through the world, as a thread, is\nspun a silence which smiles, and on the end of events we find placarded\nlarge the words: ""Why were ye afraid?"" A dignified Hope, therefore--even\nnow, when we cower beneath this worldwide shadow of the wings of the\nCondor of Death--becomes us: and, indeed, we see such an attitude among\nsome of the humblest of our people, from whose heart ascends the cry:\n""Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."" Here, therefore, O Lord! O\nLord, look down, and save!\n\n\'But even as we thus write of hope, Reason, if we would hear her,\nwhispers us ""fool"": and inclement is the sky of earth. No more ships can\nNew York Harbour contain, and whereas among us men die weekly of\nprivations by the hundred thousand, yonder across the sea they perish by\nthe million: for where the rich are pinched, how can the poor live?\nAlready 700 out of the 1000 millions of our race have perished, and the\nempires of civilisation have crumbled like sand-castles in a horror of\nanarchy. Thousands upon thousands of unburied dead, anticipating the\nmore deliberate doom that comes and smokes, and rides and comes and\ncomes, and does not fail, encumber the streets of London, Manchester,\nLiverpool. The guides of the nation have fled; the father stabs his\nchild, and the wife her husband, for a morsel of food; the fields lie\nwaste; wanton crowds carouse in our churches, universities, palaces,\nbanks and hospitals; we understand that late last night three\nterritorial regiments, the Munster Fusiliers, and the Lotian and East\nLancashire Regiments, riotously disbanded themselves, shooting two\nofficers; infectious diseases, as we all know, have spread beyond limit;\nin several towns the police seem to have disappeared, and, in nearly\nall, every vestige of decency; the results following upon the sudden\nrelease of the convicts appear to be monstrous in the respective\ndistricts; and within three short months Hell seems to have acquired\nthis entire planet, sending forth Horror, like a rabid wolf, and\nDespair, like a disastrous sky, to devour and confound her. Hear,\ntherefore, O Lord, and forgive our iniquities! O Lord, we beseech Thee!\nLook down, O Lord, and spare!\'\n\n     *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I had read this, and the rest of the paper, which had one whole\nsheet-side blank, I sat a long hour there, eyeing a little patch of the\npurple ash on a waxed board near the corner where the girl sat with her\ntime-pieces, so useless in her Eternity; and there was not a feeling in\nme, except a pricking of curiosity, which afterwards became morbid and\nravenous, to know something more of that cloud, or smoke, of which this\nman spoke, of its dates, its origin, its nature, its minute details.\nAfterwards, I went down, and entered several houses, searching for more\npapers, but did not find any; then I found a paper-shop which was open,\nwith boards outside, but either it had been deserted, or printing must\nhave stopped about the date of the paper which I had read, for the only\nthree news-papers there were dated long prior, and I did not read them.\n\nNow it was raining, and a blustering autumn day it was, distributing the\nodours of the world, and bringing me continual mixed whiffs of flowers\nand the hateful stench of decay. But I would not mind it much.\n\nI wandered and wandered, till I was tired of spahi and bashi-bazouk, of\nGreek and Catalan, of Russian \'pope\' and Coptic abuna, of dragoman and\nCalmuck, of Egyptian maulawi and Afghan mullah, Neapolitan and sheik,\nand the nightmare of wild poses, colours, stuffs and garbs, the\nyellow-green kefie of the Bedouin, shawl-turbans of Baghdad, the\nvoluminous rose-silk tob of women, and face-veils, and stark distorted\nnakedness, and sashes of figured muslin, and the workman\'s cords, and\nthe red tarboosh. About four, for very weariness, I was sitting on a\ndoor-steep, bent beneath the rain; but soon was up again, fascinated no\ndoubt by this changing bazaar of sameness, its chance combinations and\npermutations, and novelty in monotony. About five I was at a station,\nmarked Harbour Station, in and about which lay a considerable crowd, but\nnot one train. I sat again, and rested, rose and roamed again; soon\nafter six I found myself at another station, called \'Priory\'; and here I\nsaw two long trains, both crowded, one on a siding, and one at the\nup-platform.\n\nI examined both engines, and found them of the old boiler steam-type\nwith manholes, heaters, autoclaves, feed-pump, &c., now rare in western\ncountries, except England. In one there was no water, but in that at the\nplatform, the float-lever, barely tilted toward the float, showed that\nthere was some in the boiler. Of this one I overhauled all the\nmachinery, and found it good, though rusted. There was plenty of fuel,\nand oil, which I supplemented from a near shop: and during ninety\nminutes my brain and hands worked with an intelligence as it were\nautomatic, of their own motion. After three journeys across the station\nand street, I saw the fire blaze well, and the manometer move; when the\nlever of the safety-valve, whose load I lightened by half an atmosphere,\nlifted, I jumped down, and tried to disconnect the long string of\ncarriages from the engine: but failed, the coupling being an automatic\narrangement new to me; nor did I care. It was now very dark; but there\nwas still oil for bull\'s-eye and lantern, and I lit them. I forgot\nnothing. I rolled driver and stoker--the guard was absent--one to the\nplatform, one upon the rails: and I took their place there. At about\n8.30 I ran out from Dover, my throttle-valve pealing high a long\nfalsetto through the bleak and desolate night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy aim was London. But even as I set out, my heart smote me: I knew\nnothing of the metals, their junctions, facing-points, sidings,\nshuntings, and complexities. Even as to whether I was going toward, or\naway from, London, I was not sure. But just in proportion as my first\ntimorousness of the engine hardened into familiarity and self-sureness,\nI quickened speed, wilfully, with an obstinacy deaf and blind.\n\nFinally, from a mere crawl at first, I was flying at a shocking\nvelocity, while something, tongue in cheek, seemed to whisper me: \'There\nmust be other trains blocking the lines, at stations, in yards, and\neverywhere--it is a maniac\'s ride, a ride of death, and Flying\nDutchman\'s frenzy: remember your dark five-deep brigade of passengers,\nwho rock and bump together, and will suffer in a collision.\' But with\nmulish stubbornness I thought: \'They wished to go to London\'; and on I\nraged, not wildly exhilarated, so far as I can remember, nor lunatic,\nbut feeling the dull glow of a wicked and morose Unreason urge in my\nbosom, while I stoked all blackened at the fire, or saw the vague mass\nof dead horse or cow, running trees and fields, and dark homestead and\ndeep-slumbering farm, flit ghostly athwart the murky air, as the\nhalf-blind saw \'men like trees walking.\'\n\nLong, however, it did not last: I could not have been twenty miles from\nDover when, on a long reach of straight lines, I made out before me a\ntarpaulined mass opposite a signal-point: and at once callousness\nchanged to terror within me. But even as I plied the brake, I felt that\nit was too late: I rushed to the gangway to make a wild leap down an\nembankment to the right, but was thrown backward by a quick series of\nrough bumps, caused by eight or ten cattle which lay there across the\nlines: and when I picked myself up, and leapt, some seconds before the\nimpact, the speed must have considerably slackened, for I received no\nfracture, but lay in semi-coma in a patch of yellow-flowered whin on\nlevel ground, and was even conscious of a fire on the lines forty yards\naway, and, all the night, of vague thunder sounding from somewhere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout five, or half-past, in the morning I was sitting up, rubbing my\neyes, in a dim light mixed with drizzle. I could see that the train of\nmy last night\'s debauch was a huddled-up chaos of fallen carriages and\ndisfigured bodies. A five-barred gate on my left opened into a hedge,\nand swung with creaks: two yards from my feet lay a little shaggy pony\nwith swollen wan abdomen, the very picture of death, and also about me a\nnumber of dead wet birds.\n\nI picked myself up, passed through the gate, and walked up a row of\ntrees to a house at their end. I found it to be a little country-tavern\nwith a barn, forming one house, the barn part much larger than the\ntavern part. I went into the tavern by a small side-door--behind the\nbar--into a parlour--up a little stair--into two rooms: but no one was\nthere. I then went round into the barn, which was paved with\ncobble-stones, and there lay a dead mare and foal, some fowls, with two\ncows. A ladder-stair led to a closed trap-door in the floor above. I\nwent up, and in the middle of a wilderness of hay saw nine\npeople--labourers, no doubt--five men and four women, huddled together,\nand with them a tin-pail containing the last of some spirit; so that\nthese had died merry.\n\nI slept three hours among them, and afterwards went back to the tavern,\nand had some biscuits of which I opened a new tin, with some ham, jam\nand apples, of which I made a good meal, for my pemmican was gone.\n\nAfterwards I went following the rail-track on foot, for the engines of\nboth the collided trains were smashed. I knew northward from southward\nby the position of the sun: and after a good many stoppages at houses,\nand by railway-banks, I came, at about eleven in the night, to a great\nand populous town.\n\nBy the Dane John and the Cathedral, I immediately recognised it as\nCanterbury, which I knew quite well. And I walked up Castle Street to\nthe High Street, conscious for the first time of that\nregularly-repeated sound, like a sob or groan, which was proceeding from\nmy throat. As there was no visible moon, and these old streets very dim,\nI had to pick my way, lest I should desecrate the dead with my foot, and\nthey all should rise with hue and cry to hunt me. However, the bodies\nhere were not numerous, most, as before, being foreigners: and these,\nscattered about this strict old English burg that mourning dark night,\npresented such a scene of the baneful wrath of God, and all abomination\nof desolation, as broke me quite down at one place, where I stood in\ntravail with jeremiads and sore sobbings and lamentations, crying out\nupon it all, God knows.\n\nOnly when I stood at the west entrance of the Cathedral I could discern,\nspreading up the dark nave, to the lantern, to the choir, a\nphantasmagorical mass of forms: I went a little inward, and striking\nthree matches, peered nearer: the two transepts, too, seemed\ncrowded--the cloister-doorway was blocked--the southwest porch thronged,\nso that a great congregation must have flocked hither shortly before\ntheir fate overtook them.\n\nHere it was that I became definitely certain that the after-odour of the\npoison was not simply lingering in the air, but was being more or less\ngiven off by the bodies: for the blossomy odour of this church actually\novercame that other odour, the whole rather giving the scent of old\nmouldy linens long embalmed in cedars.\n\nWell, away with stealthy trot I ran from the abysmal silence of that\nplace, and in Palace Street near made one of those sudden immoderate\nrackets that seemed to outrage the universe, and left me so woefully\nfaint, decrepit, and gasping for life (the noise of the train was\ndifferent, for there I was flying, but here a captive, and which way I\nran was capture). Passing in Palace Street, I saw a little lampshop, and\nwanting a lantern, tried to get in, but the door was locked; so, after\ngoing a few steps, and kicking against a policeman\'s truncheon, I\nreturned to break the window-glass. I knew that it would make a fearful\nnoise, and for some fifteen or twenty minutes stood hesitating: but\nnever could I have dreamed, my good God, of _such_ a noise, so\npassionate, so dominant, so divulgent, and, O Heaven, so long-lasting:\nfor I seemed to have struck upon the weak spot of some planet, which\ncame suddenly tumbling, with protracted bellowing and _dÃ©bÃ¢cle_, about\nmy ears. It was a good hour before I would climb in; but then quickly\nfound what I wanted, and some big oil-cans; and till one or two in the\nmorning, the innovating flicker of my lantern went peering at random\ninto the gloomy nooks of the town.\n\nUnder a deep old Gothic arch that spanned a pavered alley, I saw the\nlittle window of a little house of rubble, and between the two\ndiamond-paned sashes rags tightly beaten in, the idea evidently being to\nmake the place air-tight against the poison. When I went in I found the\ndoor of that room open, though it, too, apparently, had been stuffed at\nthe edges; and on the threshold an old man and woman lay low. I\nconjectured that, thus protected, they had remained shut in, till either\nhunger, or the lack of oxygen in the used-up air, drove them forth,\nwhereupon the poison, still active, must have instantly ended them. I\nfound afterwards that this expedient of making air-tight had been widely\nresorted to; and it might well have proved successful, if both the\nsupply of inclosed air, and of food, had been anywhere commensurate with\nthe durability of the poisonous state.\n\nWeary, weary as I grew, some morbid persistence sustained me, and I\nwould not rest. About four in the morning I was at a station again,\nindustriously bending, poor wretch, at the sooty task of getting another\nengine ready for travel. This time, when steam was up, I succeeded in\nuncoupling the carriages from the engine, and by the time morning\nbroke, I was lightly gliding away over the country, whither I did not\nknow, but making for London.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I went with more intelligence and caution, and got on very well,\ntravelling seven days, never at night, except it was very clear, never\nat more than twenty or twenty-five miles, and crawling through tunnels.\nI do not know the maze into which the train took me, for very soon after\nleaving Canterbury it must have gone down some branch-line, and though\nthe names were marked at stations, that hardly helped me, for of their\nsituation relatively to London I was seldom sure. Moreover, again and\nagain was my progress impeded by trains on the metals, when I would have\nto run back to a shunting-point or a siding, and, in two instances,\nthese being far behind, changed from my own to the impeding engine. On\nthe first day I travelled unhindered till noon, when I stopped in open\ncountry that seemed uninhabited for ages, only that half a mile to the\nleft, on a shaded sward, was a large stone house of artistic design,\ncoated with tinted harling, the roof of red Ruabon tiles, and timbered\ngables. I walked to it after another row with putting out the fire and\narranging for a new one, the day being bright and mild, with great\nmasses of white cloud in the sky. The house had an outer and an inner\nhall, three reception rooms, fine oil-paintings, a kind of museum, and a\nlarge kitchen. In a bed-room above-stairs I found three women with\nservants\' caps, and a footman, arranged in a strange symmetrical way,\nhead to head, like rays of a star. As I stood looking at them, I could\nhave sworn, my good God, that I heard someone coming up the stairs. But\nit was some slight creaking of the breeze in the house, augmented a\nhundredfold to my inflamed and fevered hearing: for, used for years now\nto this silence of Eternity, it is as though I hear all sounds through\nan ear-trumpet. I went down, and after eating, and drinking some\nclary-water, made of brandy, sugar, cinnamon, and rose water, which I\nfound in plenty, I lay down on a sofa in the inner hall, and slept a\nquiet sleep until near midnight.\n\nI went out then, still possessed with the foolish greed to reach London,\nand after getting the engine to rights, went off under a clear black sky\nthronged with worlds and far-sown spawn, some of them, I thought,\nperhaps like this of mine, whelmed and drowned in oceans of silence,\nwith one only inhabitant to see it, and hear its silence. And all the\nlong night I travelled, stopping twice only, once to get the coal from\nan engine which had impeded me, and once to drink some water, which I\ntook care, as always, should be running water. When I felt my head nod,\nand my eyes close about 5 A.M., I threw myself, just outside the arch of\na tunnel upon a grassy bank, pretty thick with stalks and flowers, the\nworkings of early dawn being then in the east: and there, till near\neleven, slept.\n\nOn waking, I noticed that the country now seemed more like Surrey than\nKent: there was that regular swell and sinking of the land; but, in\nfact, though it must have been either, it looked like neither, for\nalready all had an aspect of return to a state of wild nature, and I\ncould see that for a year at the least no hand had tended the soil. Near\nbefore me was a stretch of lucerne of such extraordinary growth, that I\nwas led during that day and the succeeding one to examine the condition\nof vegetation with some minuteness, and nearly everywhere I detected a\ncertain hypertrophie tendency in stamens, calycles, pericarps, and\npistils, in every sort of bulbiferous growth that I looked at, in the\nrushes, above all, the fronds, mosses, lichens, and all cryptogamia, and\nin the trefoils, clover especially, and some creepers. Many\ncrop-fields, it was clear, had been prepared, but not sown; some had\nnot been reaped: and in both cases I was struck with their appearance of\nrankness, as I was also when in Norway, and was all the more surprised\nthat this should be the case at a time when a poison, whose action is\nthe arrest of oxidation, had traversed the earth; I could only conclude\nthat its presence in large volumes in the lower strata of the atmosphere\nhad been more or less temporary, and that the tendency to exuberance\nwhich I observed was due to some principle by which Nature acts with\nfreer energy and larger scope in the absence of man.\n\nTwo yards from the rails I saw, when I got up, a little rill beside a\nrotten piece of fence, barely oozing itself onward under masses of foul\nand stagnant fungoids: and here there was a sudden splash, and life: and\nI caught sight of the hind legs of a diving young frog. I went and lay\non my belly, poring over the clear dulcet little water, and presently\nsaw two tiny bleaks, or ablets, go gliding low among the swaying\nmoss-hair of the bottom-rocks, and thought how gladly would I be one of\nthem, with my home so thatched and shady, and my life drowned in their\nwide-eyed reverie. At any rate, these little creatures are alive, the\nbatrachians also, and, as I found the next day, pupae and chrysales of\none sort or another, for, to my deep emotion, I saw a little white\nbutterfly staggering in the air over the flower-garden of a rustic\nstation named Butley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was while I was lying there, poring upon that streamlet, that a\nthought came into my head: for I said to myself: \'If now I be here\nalone, alone, alone... alone, alone... one on the earth... and my girth\nhave a spread of 25,000 miles... what will happen to my mind? Into what\nkind of creature shall I writhe and change? I may live two years so!\nWhat will have happened then? I may live five years--ten! What will have\nhappened after the five? the ten? I may live twenty, thirty, forty...\'\n\nAlready, already, there are things that peep and sprout within me...!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wanted food and fresh running water, and walked from the engine half a\nmile through fields of lucerne whose luxuriance quite hid the\nfoot-paths, and reached my shoulder. After turning the brow of a hill, I\ncame to a park, passing through which I saw some dead deer and three\npersons, and emerged upon a terraced lawn, at the end of which stood an\nEarly English house of pale brick with copings, plinths, stringcourses\nof limestone, and spandrels of carved marble; and some distance from the\nporch a long table, or series of tables, in the open air, still spread\nwith cloths that were like shrouds after a month of burial; and the\ntable had old foods on it, and some lamps; and all around it, and all on\nthe lawn, were dead peasants. I seemed to know the house, probably from\nsome print which I may have seen, but I could not make out the\nescutcheon, though I saw from its simplicity that it must be very\nancient. Right across the faÃ§ade spread still some of the letters in\nevergreens of the motto: \'Many happy returns of the day,\' so that\nsomeone must have come of age, or something, for inside all was gala,\nand it was clear that these people had defied a fate which they, of\ncourse, foreknew. I went nearly throughout the whole spacious place of\nthick-carpeted halls, marbles, and famous oils, antlers and arras, and\ngilt saloons, and placid large bed-chambers: and it took me an hour.\nThere were here not less than a hundred and eighty people. In the first\nof a vista of three large reception-rooms lay what could only have been\na number of quadrille parties, for to the _coup d\'oeil_ they presented a\ntwo-and-two appearance, made very repulsive by their jewels and\nevening-dress. I had to steel my heart to go through this house, for I\ndid not know if these people were looking at me as soon as my back was\nturned. Once I was on the very point of flying, for I was going up the\ngreat central stairway, and there came a pelt of dead leaves against a\nwindow-pane in a corridor just above on the first floor, which thrilled\nme to the inmost soul. But I thought that if I once fled, they would all\nbe at me from behind, and I should be gibbering mad long, long before I\nreached the outer hall, and so stood my ground, even defiantly\nadvancing. In a small dark bedroom in the north wing on the second\nfloor--that is to say, at the top of the house--I saw a tall young lady\nand a groom, or wood-man, to judge by his clothes, horribly riveted in\nan embrace on a settee, she with a light coronet on her head in\nlow-necked dress, and their lipless teeth still fiercely pressed\ntogether. I collected in a bag a few delicacies from the under-regions\nof this house, Lyons sausages, salami, mortadel, apples, roes, raisins,\nartichokes, biscuits, a few wines, a ham, bottled fruit, pickles,\ncoffee, and so on, with a gold plate, tin-opener, cork-screw, fork, &c.,\nand dragged them all the long way back to the engine before I could eat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy brain was in such a way, that it was several days before the\nperfectly obvious means of finding my way to London, since I wished to\ngo there, at all occurred to me; and the engine went wandering the\nintricate railway-system of the south country, I having twice to water\nher with a coal-bucket from a pool, for the injector was giving no water\nfrom the tank under the coals, and I did not know where to find any near\ntank-sheds. On the fifth evening, instead of into London, I ran into\nGuildford.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, from eleven till the next day, there was a great storm over\nEngland: let me note it down. And ten days later, on the 17th of the\nmonth came another; and on the 23rd another; and I should be put to it\nto count the great number since. And they do not resemble English\nstorms, but rather Arctic ones, in a certain very suggestive something\nof personalness, and a carousing malice, and a Tartarus gloom, which I\ncannot quite describe. That night at Guildford, after wandering about,\nand becoming very weary, I threw myself upon a cushioned pew in an old\nNorman church with two east apses, called St. Mary\'s, using a\nBible-cushion for pillow, and placing some distance away a little tin\nlamp turned low, whose ray served me for _veilleuse_ through the night.\nHappily I had taken care to close up everything, or, I feel sure, the\nroof must have gone. Only one dead, an old lady in a chapel on the north\nside of the chancel, whom I rather mistrusted, was there with me: and\nthere I lay listening: for, after all, I could not sleep a wink, while\noutside vogued the immense tempest. And I communed with myself,\nthinking: \'I, poor man, lost in this conflux of infinitudes and vortex\nof the world, what can become of me, my God? For dark, ah dark, is the\nwaste void into which from solid ground I am now plunged a million\nfathoms deep, the sport of all the whirlwinds: and it were better for me\nto have died with the dead, and never to have seen the wrath and\nturbulence of the Ineffable, nor to have heard the thrilling bleakness\nof the winds of Eternity, when they pine, and long, and whimper, and\nwhen they vociferate and blaspheme, and when they expostulate and\nintrigue and implore, and when they despair and die, which ear of man\nshould never hear. For they mean to eat me up, I know, these Titanic\ndarknesses: and soon like a whiff I shall pass away, and leave the world\nto them.\' So till next morning I lay mumping, with shivers and\ncowerings: for the shocks of the storm pervaded the locked church to my\nvery heart; and there were thunders that night, my God, like callings\nand laughs and banterings, exchanged between distant hill-tops in Hell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\'Well, the next morning I went down the steep High Street, and found a\nyoung nun at the bottom whom I had left the previous evening with a\nnumber of girls in uniform opposite the Guildhall--half-way up the\nstreet. She must have been spun down, arm over arm, for the wind was\nwesterly, and whereas I had left her completely dressed to her wimple\nand beads, she was now nearly stripped, and her little flock scattered.\nAnd branches of trees, and wrecked houses, and reeling clouds of dead\nleaves were everywhere that wild morning.\n\nThis town of Guildford appeared to be the junction of an extraordinary\nnumber of railway-lines, and before again setting out in the afternoon,\nwhen the wind had lulled, having got an A B C guide, and a railway-map,\nI decided upon my line, and upon a new engine, feeling pretty sure now\nof making London, only thirty miles away. I then set out, and about five\no\'clock was at Surbiton, near my aim; I kept on, expecting every few\nminutes to see the great city, till darkness fell, and still, at\nconsiderable risk, I went, as I thought, forward: but no London was\nthere. I had, in fact, been on a loop-line, and at Surbiton gone wrong\nagain; for the next evening I found myself at Wokingham, farther away\nthan ever.\n\nI slept on a rug in the passage of an inn called The Rose, for there was\na wild, Russian-looking man, with projecting top-teeth, on a bed in the\nhouse, whose appearance I did not like, and it was late, and I too tired\nto walk further; and the next morning pretty early I set out again, and\nat 10 A.M. was at Reading.\n\nThe notion of navigating the land by precisely the same means as the\nsea, simple and natural as it was, had not at all occurred to me: but at\nthe first accidental sight of a compass in a little shop-window near the\nriver at Reading, my difficulties as to getting to any desired place in\nthe world vanished once and for all: for a good chart or map, the\ncompass, a pair of compasses, and, in the case of longer distances, a\nquadrant, sextant or theodolite, with a piece of paper and pencil, were\nall that were necessary to turn an engine into a land-ship, one choosing\nthe lines that ran nearest the direction of one\'s course, whenever they\ndid not run precisely.\n\nThus provided, I ran out from Reading about seven in the evening, while\nthere was still some light, having spent there some nine hours. This was\nthe town where I first observed that shocking crush of humanity, which\nI afterwards met in every large town west of London. Here, I should say,\nthe English were quite equal in number to the foreigners: and there were\nenough of both, God knows: for London must have poured many here. There\nwere houses, in every room of which, and on the stairs, the dead\nactually overlay each other, and in the streets before them were points\nwhere only on flesh, or under carriages, was it possible to walk. I went\ninto the great County Gaol, from which, as I had read, the prisoners had\nbeen released two weeks before-hand, and there I found the same pressed\ncondition, cells occupied by ten or twelve, the galleries continuously\nrough-paved with faces, heads, and old-clothes-shops of robes; and in\nthe parade-ground, against one wall, a mass of human stuff, like tough\ngrey clay mixed with rags and trickling black gore, where a crush as of\nhydraulic power must have acted. At a corner between a gate and a wall\nnear the biscuit-factory of this town I saw a boy, whom I believe to\nhave been blind, standing jammed, at his wrist a chain-ring, and, at the\nend of the chain, a dog; from his hap-hazard posture I conjectured that\nhe, and chain, and dog had been lifted from the street, and placed so,\nby the storm of the 7th of the month; and what made it very curious was\nthat his right arm pointed a little outward just over the dog, so that,\nat the moment when I first sighted him, he seemed a drunken fellow\nsetting his dog at me. In fact, all the dead I found much mauled and\nstripped and huddled: and the earth seemed to be making an abortive\neffort to sweep her streets.\n\nWell, some little distance from Reading I saw a big flower-seed farm,\nlooking dead in some plots, and in others quite rank: and here again,\nfluttering quite near the engine, two little winged aurelians in the\nquiet evening air. I went on, passing a great number of crowded trains\non the down-line, two of them in collision, and very broken up, and one\nexploded engine; even the fields and cuttings on either hand of the line\nhad a rather populous look, as if people, when trains and vehicles\nfailed, had set to trudging westward in caravans and streams. When I\ncame to a long tunnel near Slough, I saw round the foot of the arch an\nextraordinary quantity of wooden _dÃ©bris_, and as I went very slowly\nthrough, was alarmed by the continuous bumping of the train, which, I\nknew, was passing over bodies; at the other end were more _dÃ©bris_; and\nI easily guessed that a company of desperate people had made the tunnel\nair-tight at the two arches, and provisioned themselves, with the hope\nto live there till the day of destiny was passed; whereupon their\nbarricades must have been crashed through by some up-train and\nthemselves crushed, or else, other crowds, mad to share their cave of\nrefuge, had stormed the boardings. This latter, as I afterwards found,\nwas a very usual event.\n\nI should very soon have got to London now, but, as my bad luck would\nhave it, I met a long up-train on the metals, with not one creature in\nany part of it. There was nothing to do but to tranship, with all my\nthings, to its engine, which I found in good condition with plenty of\ncoal and water, and to set it going, a hateful labour: I being already\njet-black from hair to toes. However, by half-past ten I found myself\nstopped by another train only a quarter of a mile from Paddington, and\nwalked the rest of the way among trains in which the standing dead still\nstood, propped by their neighbours, and over metals where bodies were as\nordinary and cheap as waves on the sea, or twigs in a forest. I believe\nthat wild crowds had given chase on foot to moving trains, or fore-run\nthem in the frenzied hope of inducing them to stop.\n\nI came to the great shed of glass and girders which is the station, the\nnight being perfectly soundless, moonless, starless, and the hour about\neleven.\n\nI found later that all the electric generating-stations, or all that I\nvisited, were intact; that is to say, must have been shut down before\nthe arrival of the doom; also that the gas-works had almost certainly\nbeen abandoned some time previously: so that this city of dreadful\nnight, in which, at the moment when Silence choked it, not less than\nforty to sixty millions swarmed and droned, must have more resembled\nTartarus and the foul shades of Hell than aught to which my fancy can\nliken it.\n\nFor, coming nearer the platforms, I saw that trains, in order to move at\nall, must have moved through a slough of bodies pushed from behind, and\nforming a packed homogeneous mass on the metals: and I knew that they\n_had_ moved. Nor could _I_ now move, unless I decided to wade: for flesh\nwas everywhere, on the roofs of trains, cramming the interval between\nthem, on the platforms, splashing the pillars like spray, piled on\ntrucks and lorries, a carnal quagmire; and outside, it filled the space\nbetween a great host of vehicles, carpeting all that region of London.\nAnd all here that odour of blossoms, which nowhere yet, save on one vile\nship, had failed, was now wholly overcome by another: and the thought\nwas in my head, my God, that if the soul of man had sent up to Heaven\nthe odour which his body gave to me, then it was not so strange that\nthings were as they were.\n\nI got out from the station, with ears, God knows, that still awaited the\naccustomed noising of this accursed town, habituated as I now was to all\nthe dumb and absent void of Soundlessness; and I was overwhelmed in a\nnew awe, and lost in a wilder woesomeness, when, instead of lights and\nbusiness, I saw the long street which I knew brood darker than Babylons\nlong desolate, and in place of its ancient noising, heard, my God, a\nshocking silence, rising higher than I had ever heard it, and blending\nwith the silence of the inane, eternal stars in heaven.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could not get into any vehicle for some time, for all thereabouts was\npractically a mere block; but near the Park, which I attained by\nstooping among wheels, and selecting my foul steps, I overhauled a\nDaimler car, found in it two cylinders of petrol, lit the ignition-lamp,\nremoved with averted abhorrence three bodies, mounted, and broke that\npopulous stillness. And through streets nowhere empty of bodies I went\nurging eastward my jolting, and spattered, and humming way.\n\nThat I should have persisted, with so much pains, to come to this\nunbounded catacomb, seems now singular to me: for by that time I could\nnot have been sufficiently daft to expect to find another being like\nmyself on the earth, though I cherished, I remember, the irrational hope\nof yet somewhere finding dog, or cat, or horse, to be with me, and would\nanon think bitterly of Reinhardt, my Arctic dog, which my own hand had\nshot. But, in reality, a morbid curiosity must have been within me all\nthe time to read the real truth of what had happened, so far as it was\nknown, or guessed, and to gloat upon all that drama, and cup of\ntrembling, and pouring out of the vials of the wrath of God, which must\nhave preceded the actual advent of the end of Time. This inquisitiveness\nhad, at every town which I reached, made the search for newspapers\nuppermost in my mind; but, by bad luck, I had found only four, all of\nthem ante-dated to the one which I had read at Dover, though their dates\ngave me some idea of the period when printing must have ceased, viz.\nsoon after the 17th July--about three months subsequent to my arrival at\nthe Pole--for none I found later than this date; and these contained\nnothing scientific, but only orisons and despairings. On arriving,\ntherefore, at London, I made straight for the office of the _Times_,\nonly stopping at a chemist\'s in Oxford Street for a bottle of antiseptic\nto hold near my nose, though, having once left the neighbourhood of\nPaddington, I had hardly much need of this.\n\nI made my way to the square where the paper was printed, to find that,\neven there, the ground was closely strewn with calpac and pugaree, black\nabayeh and fringed praying-shawl, hob-nail and sandal, figured lungi and\nstriped silk, all very muddled and mauled. Through the dark square to\nthe twice-dark building I passed, and found open the door of an\nadvertisement-office; but on striking a match, saw that it had been\nlighted by electricity, and had therefore to retrace my stumbling steps,\ntill I came to a shop of lamps in a near alley, walking meantime with\ntimid cares that I might hurt no one--for in this enclosed neighbourhood\nI began to feel strange tremors, and kept striking matches, which, so\nstill was the black air, hardly flickered.\n\nWhen I returned to the building with a little lighted lamp, I at once\nsaw a file on a table, and since there were a number of dead there, and\nI wished to be alone, I took the heavy mass of paper between my left arm\nand side, and the lamp in my right hand; passed then behind a counter;\nand then, to the right, up a stair which led me into a very great\nbuilding and complexity of wooden steps and corridors, where I went\npeering, the lamp visibly trembling in my hand, for here also were the\ndead. Finally, I entered a good-sized carpeted room with a baize-covered\ntable in the middle, and large smooth chairs, and on the table many\nmanuscripts impregnated with purple dust, and around were books in\nshelves. This room had been locked upon a single man, a tall man in a\nfrock-coat, with a pointed grey beard, who at the last moment had\ndecided to fly from it, for he lay at the threshold, apparently fallen\ndead the moment he opened the door. Him, by drawing his feet aside, I\nremoved, locked the door upon myself, sat at the table before the dusty\nfile, and, with the little lamp near, began to search.\n\nI searched and read till far into the morning. But God knows, He\nalone....\n\nI had not properly filled the little reservoir with oil, and at about\nthree in the fore-day, it began to burn sullenly lower, letting sparks,\nand turning the glass grey: and in my deepest chilly heart was the\nquestion: \'Suppose the lamp goes out before the daylight....\'\n\nI knew the Pole, and cold, I knew them well: but to be frozen by panic,\nmy God! I read, I say, I searched, I would not stop: but I read that\nnight racked by terrors such as have never yet entered into the heart\nof man to conceive. My flesh moved and crawled like a lake which, here\nand there, the breeze ruffles. Sometimes for two, three, four minutes,\nthe profound interest of what I read would fix my mind, and then I would\nperuse an entire column, or two, without consciousness of the meaning of\none single word, my brain all drawn away to the innumerable host of the\nwan dead that camped about me, pierced with horror lest they should\nstart, and stand, and accuse me: for the grave and the worm was the\nworld; and in the air a sickening stirring of cerements and shrouds; and\nthe taste of the pale and insubstantial grey of ghosts seemed to infect\nmy throat, and faint odours of the loathsome tomb my nostrils, and the\ntoll of deep-toned passing-bells my ears; finally the lamp smouldered\nvery low, and my charnel fancy teemed with the screwing-down of coffins,\nlych-gates and sextons, and the grating of ropes that lower down the\ndead, and the first sound of the earth upon the lid of that strait and\ngloomy home of the mortal; that lethal look of cold dead fingers I\nseemed to see before me, the insipidness of dead tongues, the pout of\nthe drowned, and the vapid froths that ridge their lips, till my flesh\nwas moist as with the stale washing-waters of morgues and mortuaries,\nand with such sweats as corpses sweat, and the mawkish tear that lies\non dead men\'s cheeks; for what is one poor insignificant man in his\nflesh against a whole world of the disembodied, he alone with them, and\nnowhere, nowhere another of his kind, to whom to appeal against them? I\nread, and I searched: but God, God knows ... If a leaf of the paper,\nwhich I slowly, warily, stealingly turned, made but one faintest rustle,\nhow did that _reveille_ boom in echoes through the vacant and haunted\nchambers of my poor aching heart, my God! and there was a cough in my\nthroat which for a cruelly long time I would not cough, till it burst in\nhorrid clamour from my lips, sending crinkles of cold through my inmost\nblood. For with the words which I read were all mixed up visions of\ncrawling hearses, wails, and lugubrious crapes, and piercing shrieks of\nmadness in strange earthy vaults, and all the mournfulness of the black\nVale of Death, and the tragedy of corruption. Twice during the ghostly\nhours of that night the absolute and undeniable certainty that some\npresence--some most gashly silent being--stood at my right elbow, so\nthrilled me, that I leapt to my feet to confront it with clenched fists,\nand hairs that bristled stiff in horror and frenzy. After that second\ntime I must have fainted; for when it was broad day, I found my dropped\nhead over the file of papers, supported on my arms. And I resolved then\nnever again after sunset to remain in any house: for that night was\nenough to kill a horse, my good God; and that this is a haunted planet I\nknow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat I read in the _Times_ was not very definite, for how could it be?\nbut in the main it confirmed inferences which I had myself drawn, and\nfairly satisfied my mind.\n\nThere had been a battle royal in the paper between my old collaborator\nProfessor Stanistreet and Dr. Martin Rogers, and never could I have\nconceived such an indecorous piece of business, men like them calling\none another \'tyro,\' \'dreamer,\' and in one place \'block-head.\'\nStanistreet denied that the perfumed odour of almonds attributed to the\nadvancing cloud could be due to anything but the excited fancy of the\nreporting fugitives, because, said he, it was unknown that either Cn,\nHCn, or K_4FeCn_6 had been given out by volcanoes, and the\ndestructiveness to life of the travelling cloud could only be owing to\nCO and CO_2. To this Rogers, in an article characterised by\nextraordinary heat, replied that he could not understand how even a\n\'tyro\'(!) in chemical and geological phenomena would venture to rush\ninto print with the statement that HCn had not commonly been given out\nby volcanoes: that it _had_ been, he said, was perfectly certain; though\nwhether it had been or not could not affect the decision of a reasoning\nmind as to whether it was being: for that cyanogen, as a matter of fact,\nwas not rare in nature, though not directly occurring, being one of the\nproducts of the common distillation of pit-coal, and found in roots,\npeaches, almonds, and many tropical flora; also that it had been\nactually pointed out as probable by more than one thinker that some salt\nor salts of Cn, the potassic, or the potassic ferrocyanide, or both,\nmust exist in considerable stores in the earth at volcanic depths. In\nreply to this, Stanistreet in a two-column article used the word\n\'dreamer,\' and Rogers, when Berlin had been already silenced, finally\nreplied with his amazing \'block-head.\' But, in my opinion, by far the\nmost learned and lucid of the scientific dicta was from the rather\nunexpected source of Sloggett, of the Dublin Science and Art Department:\nhe, without fuss, accepted the statements of the fugitive eye-witnesses,\ndown to the assertion that the cloud, as it rolled travelling, seemed\nmixed from its base to the clouds with languid tongues of purple flame,\nrose-coloured at their edges. This, Sloggett explained, was the\ncharacteristic flame of both cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid vapour,\nwhich, being inflammable, may have become locally ignited in the passage\nover cities, and only burned in that limited and languid way on account\nof the ponderous volumes of carbonic anhydride with which they must, of\ncourse, be mixed: the dark empurpled colour was due to the presence of\nlarge quantities of the scoriae of the trappean rocks: basalts,\ngreen-stone, trachytes, and the various porphyries. This article was\nmost remarkable for its clear divination, because written so early--not\nlong, in fact, after the cessation of telegraphic communication with\nAustralia and China; and at a date so early Sloggett stated that the\ncharacter of the devastation not only proved an eruption--another, but\nfar greater Krakatoa--probably in some South Sea region, but indicated\nthat its most active product must be, not CO, but potassic ferrocyanide\n(K_4FeCn_6), which, undergoing distillation with the products of sulphur\nin the heat of eruption, produced hydrocyanic acid (HCn); and this\nvolatile acid, he said, remaining in a vaporous state in all climates\nabove a temperature of 26.5Â° C., might involve the entire earth, if the\neruption proved sufficiently powerful, travelling chiefly in a direction\ncontrary to the earth\'s west-to-east motion, the only regions which\nwould certainly be exempt being the colder regions of the Arctic\ncircles, where the vapour of the acid would assume the liquid state, and\nfall as rain. He did not anticipate that vegetation would be permanently\naffected, unless the eruption were of inconceivable duration and\nactivity, for though the poisonous quality of hydrocyanic acid consisted\nin its sudden and complete arrest of oxidation, vegetation had two\nsources of life--the soil as well as the air; with this exception, all\nlife, down to the lowest evolutionary forms, would disappear (here was\nthe one point in which he was somewhat at fault), until the earth\nreproduced them. For the rest, he fixed the rate of the on-coming cloud\nat from 100 to 105 miles a day; and the date of eruption, either the\n14th, 15th, or 16th of April--which was either one, two, or three days\nafter the arrival of the _Boreal_ party at the Pole; and he concluded by\nsaying that, if the facts were as he had stated them, then he could\nsuggest no hiding-place for the race of man, unless such places as mines\nand tunnels could be made air-tight; nor could even they be of use to\nany considerable number, except in the event of the poisonous state of\nthe air being of very short duration.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had thought of mines before: but in a very languid way, till this\narticle, and other things that I read, as it were struck my brain a slap\nwith the notion. For \'there,\' I said, \'if anywhere, shall I find a\nman....\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went out from that building that morning feeling like a man bowed down\nwith age, for the depths of unutterable horror into which I had had\nglimpses during that one night made me very feeble, and my steps\ntottered, and my brain reeled.\n\nI got out into Farringdon Street, and at the near Circus, where four\nstreets meet, had under my furthest range of vision nothing but four\nfields of bodies, bodies, clad in a rag-shop of every faded colour, or\nhalf-clad, or not clad at all, actually, in many cases, over-lying one\nanother, as I had seen at Reading, but here with a markedly more\nskeleton appearance: for I saw the swollen-looking shoulders, sharp\nhips, hollow abdomens, and stiff bony limbs of people dead from famine,\nthe whole having the grotesque air of some _macabre_ battle-field of\nfallen marionettes. Mixed with these was an extraordinary number of\nvehicles of all sorts, so that I saw that driving among them would be\nimpracticable, whereas the street which I had taken during the night\nwas fairly clear. I thought a minute what I should do: then went by a\nparallel back-street, and came out to a shop in the Strand, where I\nhoped to find all the information which I needed about the excavations\nof the country. The shutters were up, and I did not wish to make any\nnoise among these people, though the morning was bright, it being about\nten o\'clock, and it was easy to effect entrance, for I saw a crow-bar in\na big covered furniture-van near. I, therefore, went northward, till I\ncame to the British Museum, the cataloguing-system of which I knew well,\nand passed in. There was no one at the library-door to bid me stop, and\nin the great round reading-room not a soul, except one old man with a\nbag of goÃ®tre hung at his neck, and spectacles, he lying up a\nbook-ladder near the shelves, a \'reader\' to the last. I got to the\nprinted catalogues, and for an hour was upstairs among the dim sacred\ngalleries of this still place, and at the sight of certain Greek and\nCoptic papyri, charters, seals, had such a dream of this ancient earth,\nmy good God, as even an angel\'s pen could not half express on paper.\nAfterwards, I went away loaded with a good hundred-weight of\nOrdnance-maps, which I had stuffed into a bag found in the cloak-room,\nwith three topographical books; I then, at an instrument-maker\'s in\nHolborn, got a sextant and theodolite, and at a grocer\'s near the river\nput into a sack-bag provisions to last me a week or two; at Blackfriars\nBridge wharf-station I found a little sharp white steamer of a few tons,\nwhich happily was driven by liquid air, so that I had no troublesome\nfire to light: and by noon I was cutting my solitary way up the Thames,\nwhich flowed as before the ancient Britons were born, and saw it, and\nbuilt mud-huts there amid the primaeval forest; and afterwards the\nRomans came, and saw it, and called it Tamesis, or Thamesis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, as I lay asleep on the cabin-cushions of my little boat\nunder the lee of an island at Richmond, I had a clear dream, in which\nsomething, or someone, came to me, and asked me a question: for it said:\n\'Why do you go seeking another man?--that you may fall upon him, and\nkiss him? or that you may fall upon him, and murder him?\' And I answered\nsullenly in my dream: \'I would not murder him. I do not wish to murder\nanyone.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was essential to me was to know, with certainty, whether I was\nreally alone: for some instinct began to whisper me: \'Find that out: be\nsure, be sure: for without the assurance you can never be--yourself.\'\n\nI passed into the great Midland Canal, and went northward, leisurely\nadvancing, for I was in no hurry. The weather remained very warm, and\ngreat part of the country was still dressed in autumn leaves. I have\nwritten, I think, of the terrific character of the tempests witnessed in\nEngland since my return: well, the calms were just as intense and novel.\nThis observation was forced upon me: and I could not but be surprised.\nThere seemed no middle course now: if there was a wind, it was a storm:\nif there was not a storm, no leaf stirred, not a roughening zephyr ran\nthe water. I was reminded of maniacs that laugh now, and rave now--but\nnever smile, and never sigh.\n\nOn the fourth afternoon I passed by Leicester, and the next morning left\nmy pleasant boat, carrying maps and compass, and at a small station took\nengine, bound for Yorkshire, where I loitered and idled away two foolish\nmonths, sometimes travelling by steam-engine, sometimes by automobile,\nsometimes by bicycle, and sometimes on foot, till the autumn was quite\nover.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were two houses in London to which especially I had thought to\ngo: one in Harley Street, and one in Hanover Square: but when it came to\nthe point, I would not; and there was a little embowered home in\nYorkshire, where I was born, to which I thought to go: but I would not,\nconfining myself for many days to the eastern half of the county.\n\nOne morning, while passing on foot along the coast-wall from Bridlington\nto Flambro\', on turning my eyes from the sea, I was confronted by a\nthing which for a moment or two struck me with the most profound\nastonishment. I had come to a mansion, surrounded by trees, three\nhundred yards from the cliffs: and there, on a path at the bottom of the\ndomain, right before me, was a board marked: \'Trespassers will be\nProsecuted.\' At once a mad desire--the first which I had had--to laugh,\nto roar with laughter, to send wild echoes of merriment clapping among\nthe chalk gullies, and abroad on the morning air, seized upon me: but I\nkept it under, though I could not help smiling at this poor man, with\nhis little delusion that a part of the earth was his.\n\nHere the cliffs are, I should say, seventy feet high, broken by frequent\nslips in the upper stratum of clay, and, as I proceeded, climbing\nalways, I encountered some rather formidable gullies in the chalk, down\nand then up which I had to scramble, till I came to a great mound or\nbarrier, stretching right across the great promontory, and backed by a\nnatural ravine, this, no doubt, having been raised as a rampart by some\nof those old invading pirate-peoples, who had their hot life-scuffle,\nand are done now, like the rest. Going on, I came to a bay in the cliff,\nwith a great number of boats lodged on the slopes, some quite high,\nthough the declivities are steep; toward the inner slopes is a lime-kiln\nwhich I explored, but found no one there. When I came out on the other\nside, I saw the village, with an old tower at one end, on a bare stretch\nof land; and thence, after an hour\'s rest in the kitchen of a little\ninn, went out to the coast-guard station, and the lighthouse.\n\nLooking across the sea eastward, the light-keepers here must have seen\nthat thick cloud of convolving browns and purples, perhaps mixed with\nsmall tongues of fire, slowly walking the water, its roof in the clouds,\nupon them: for this headland is in precisely the same longitude as\nLondon; and, reckoning from the hour when, as recorded in the _Times_,\nthe cloud was seen from Dover over Calais, London and Flambro\' must have\nbeen overtaken soon after three o\'clock on the Sunday afternoon, the\n25th July. At sight in open daylight of a doom so gloomy--prophesied,\nbut perhaps hoped against to the last, and now come--the light-keepers\nmust have fled howling, supposing them to have so long remained faithful\nto duty: for here was no one, and in the village very few. In this\nlighthouse, which is a circular white tower, eighty feet high, on the\nedge of the cliff, is a book for visitors to sign their names: and I\nwill write something down here in black and white: for the secret is\nbetween God only, and me: After reading a few of the names, I took my\npencil, and I wrote my name there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reef before the Head stretches out a quarter of a mile, looking bold\nin the dead low-water that then was, and showing to what extent the sea\nhas pushed back this coast, three wrecks impaled on them, and a big\nsteamer quite near, waiting for the first movements of the already\nstrewn sea to perish. All along the cliff-wall to the bluff crowned by\nScarborough Castle northward, and to the low vanishing coast of\nHolderness southward, appeared those cracks and caves which had brought\nme here, though there seemed no attempts at barricades; however, I got\ndown a rough slope on the south side to a rude wild beach, strewn with\nwave-worn masses of chalk: and never did I feel so paltry and short a\nthing as there, with far-outstretched bays of crags about me, their\nbluffs encrusted at the base with stale old leprosies of shells and\nbarnacles, and crass algae-beards, and, higher up, the white cliff all\nstained and weather-spoiled, the rock in some parts looking quite\nchalky, and elsewhere gleaming hard and dull like dirty marbles, while\nin the huge withdrawals of the coast yawn darksome gullies and caverns.\nHere, in that morning\'s walk, I saw three little hermit-crabs, a limpet,\nand two ninnycocks in a pool of weeds under a bearded rock. What\nastonished me here, and, indeed, above, and everywhere, in London even,\nand other towns, was the incredible number of birds that strewed the\nground, at some points resembling a real rain, birds of nearly every\nsort, including tropic specimens: so that I had to conclude that they,\ntoo, had fled before the cloud from country to country, till conquered\nby weariness and grief, and then by death.\n\nBy climbing over rocks thick with periwinkles, and splashing through\ngreat sloppy stretches of crinkled sea-weed, which give a raw stench of\nbrine, I entered the first of the gullies: a narrow, long, winding one,\nwith sides polished by the sea-wash, and the floor rising inwards. In\nthe dark interior I struck matches, able still to hear from outside the\nponderous spasmodic rush and jostle of the sea between the crags of the\nreef, but now quite faintly. Here, I knew, I could meet only dead men,\nbut urged by some curiosity, I searched to the end, wading in the middle\nthrough a three-feet depth of sea-weed twine: but there was no one; and\nonly belemnites and fossils in the chalk. I searched several to the\nsouth of the headland, and then went northward past it toward another\nopening and place of perched boats, called in the map North Landing:\nwhere, even now, a distinct smell of fish, left by the old crabbers and\nherring-fishers, was perceptible. A number of coves and bays opened as I\nproceeded; a faded green turf comes down in curves at some parts on the\ncliff-brows, like wings of a young soldier\'s hair, parted in the middle,\nand plastered on his brow; isolated chalk-masses are numerous, obelisks,\ntop-heavy columns, bastions; at one point no less than eight headlands\nstretched to the end of the world before me, each pierced by its arch,\nNorman or Gothic, in whole or in half; and here again caves, in one of\nwhich I found a carpet-bag stuffed with a wet pulp like bread, and,\nstuck to the rock, a Turkish tarboosh; also, under a limestone quarry,\nfive dead asses: but no man. The east coast had evidently been shunned.\nFinally, in the afternoon I reached Filey, very tired, and there slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went onward by train-engine all along the coast to a region of\niron-ore, alum, and jet-excavations round Whitby and Middlesborough. By\nby-ways near the small place of Goldsborough I got down to the shore at\nKettleness, and reached the middle of a bay in which is a cave called\nthe Hob-Hole, with excavations all around, none of great depth, made by\njet-diggers and quarrymen. In the cave lay a small herd of cattle,\nthough for what purpose put there I cannot guess; and in the\njet-excavations I found nothing. A little further south is the chief\nalum-region, as at Sandsend, but as soon as I saw a works, and the great\ngap in the ground like a crater, where the lias is quarried, containing\nonly heaps of alum-shale, brushwood-stacks, and piles of cement-nodules\nextracted from the lias, I concluded that here could have been found no\nhiding; nor did I purposely visit the others, though I saw two later.\nFrom round Whitby, and those rough moors, I went on to Darlington, not\nfar now from my home: but I would not continue that way, and after two\ndays\' indecisive lounging, started for Richmond and the lead mines\nabout Arkengarth Dale, near Reeth. Here begins a region of mountain,\nvarious with glens, fells, screes, scars, swards, becks, passes,\nvillages, river-heads, and dales. Some of the faces which I saw in it\nalmost seemed to speak to me in a broad dialect which I knew. But they\nwere not numerous in proportion: for all this country-side must have had\nits population multiplied by at least some hundreds; and the villages\nhad rather the air of Danube, Levant, or Spanish villages. In one, named\nMarrick, I saw that the street had become the scene either of a great\nbattle or a great massacre; and soon I was everywhere coming upon men\nand women, English and foreign, dead from violence: cracked heads,\nwounds, unhung jaws, broken limbs, and so on. Instead of going direct to\nthe mines from Reeth, that waywardness which now rules my mind, as\nsqualls an abandoned boat, took me somewhat further south-west to the\nvillage of Thwaite, which I actually could not enter, so occupied with\ndead was every spot on which the eye rested a hundred yards about it.\nNot far from here I turned up, on foot now, a very steep, stony road to\nthe right, which leads over the Buttertubs Pass into Wensleydale, the\nday being very warm and bright, with large clouds that looked like\nlakes of molten silver giving off grey fumes in their centre, casting\nmoody shadows over the swardy dale, which below Thwaite expands, showing\nMuker two miles off, the largest village of Upper Swaledale. Soon,\nclimbing, I could look down upon miles of Swaledale and the hills\nbeyond, a rustic panorama of glens and grass, river and cloudshadow, and\nthere was something of lightness in my step that fair day, for I had\nleft all my maps and things, except one, at Reeth, to which I meant to\nreturn, and the earth, which is very good, was--mine. The ascent was\nrough, and also long: but if I paused and looked behind--I saw, I saw.\nMan\'s notion of a Heaven, a Paradise, reserved for the spirits of the\ngood, clearly arose from impressions which the earth made upon his mind:\nfor no Paradise can be fairer than this; just as his notion of a Hell\narose from the squalid mess into which his own foolish habits of thought\nand action turned this Paradise. At least, so it struck me then: and,\nthinking it, there was a hiss in my breath, as I went up into what more\nand more acquired the character of a mountain pass, with points of\nalmost Alpine savagery: for after I had skirted the edge of a deep glen\non the left, the slopes changed in character, heather was on the\nmountain-sides, a fretting beck sent up its noise, then screes, and\nscars, and a considerable waterfall, and a landscape of crags; and\nlastly a broad and rather desolate summit, palpably nearer the clouds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days later I was at the mines: and here I first saw that wide-spread\nscene of horror with which I have since become familiar. The story of\nsix out of ten of them all is the same, and short: selfish \'owners,\' an\nousted world, an easy bombardment, and the destruction of all concerned,\nbefore the arrival of the cloud in many cases. About some of the Durham\npit-mouths I have been given the impression that the human race lay\ncollected there; and that the notion of hiding himself in a mine must\nhave occurred to every man alive, and sent him thither.\n\nIn these lead mines, as in most vein-mining, there are more shafts than\nin collieries, and hardly any attempt at artificial ventilation, except\nat rises, winzes and cul-de-sacs. I found accordingly that, though their\ndepth does not exceed three hundred feet, suffocation must often have\nanticipated the other dreaded death. In nearly every shaft, both up-take\nand down-take, was a ladder, either of the mine, or of the fugitives,\nand I was able to descend without difficulty, having dressed myself in a\nhouse at the village in a check flannel shirt, a pair of two-buttoned\ntrousers with circles of leather at the knees, thick boots, and a\nminer\'s hat, having a leather socket attached to it, into which fitted a\nstraight handle from a cylindrical candlestick; with this light, and\nalso a Davy-lamp, which I carried about with me for a good many months,\nI lived for the most part in the deeps of the earth, searching for the\ntreasure of a life, to find everywhere, in English duckies and guggs,\nPomeranian women in gaudy stiff cloaks, the Walachian, the Mameluk, the\nKhirgiz, the Bonze, the Imaum, and almost every type of man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne most brilliant Autumn day I walked by the village market-cross at\nBarnard, come at last, but with a tenderness in my heart, and a\nreluctance, to where I was born; for I said I would go and see my sister\nAda, and--the other old one. I leaned and loitered a long time on the\nbridge, gazing up to the craggy height, which is heavy with waving wood,\nand crowned by the Castle-tower, the Tees sweeping round the\nmountain-base, smooth here and sunlit, but a mile down, where I wished\nto go, but would not, brawling bedraggled and lacerated, like a sweet\nstrumpet, all shallow among rocks under reaches of shadow--the shadow of\nRokeby Woods. I climbed very leisurely up the hill-side, having in my\nhand a bag with a meal, and up the stair in the wall to the top I went,\nwhere there is no parapet, but a massiveness of wall that precludes\ndanger; and here in my miner\'s attire I sat three hours, brooding\nsleepily upon the scene of lush umbrageous old wood that marks the long\nway the river takes, from Marwood Chase up above, and where the rapid\nBalder bickers in, down to bowery Rokeby, touched now with autumn; the\nthickness of trees lessening away toward the uplands, where there are\nfar etherealized stretches of fields within hedgerows, and in the sunny\nmirage of the farthest azure remoteness hints of lonesome moorland. It\nwas not till near three that I went down along the river, then, near\nRokeby, traversing the old meadow, and ascending the old hill: and\nthere, as of old, was the little black square with yellow letters on the\ngate-wall:\n\n  HUNT HILL HOUSE.\n\nNo part, no house, I believe, of this country-side was empty of strange\ncorpses: and they were in Hunt Hill, too. I saw three in the weedy plot\nto the right of the garden-path, where once the hawthorn and lilac tree\nhad grown from well-rollered grass, and in the little bush-wilderness to\nthe left, which was always a wilderness, one more: and in the\nbreakfast-room, to the right of the hall, three; and in the new wooden\nclinker-built attachment opening upon the breakfast-room, two, half\nunder the billiard-table; and in her room overlooking the porch on the\nfirst floor, the long thin form of my mother on her bed, with crushed-in\nleft temple, and at the foot of the bed, face-downward on the floor,\nblack-haired Ada in a night-dress.\n\nOf all the men and women who died, they two alone had burying. For I\ndigged a hole with the stable-spade under the front lilac; and I wound\nthem in the sheets, foot and form and head; and, not without throes and\nqualms, I bore and buried them there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time passed after this before the long, multitudinous, and\nperplexing task of visiting the mine-regions again claimed me. I found\nmyself at a place called Ingleborough, which is a big table-mountain,\nwith a top of fifteen to twenty acres, from which the sea is visible\nacross Lancashire to the west; and in the sides of this strange hill are\na number of caves which I searched during three days, sleeping in a\ngarden-shed at a very rural and flower-embowered village, for every room\nin it was thronged, a place marked Clapham in the chart, in Clapdale,\nwhich latter is a dale penetrating the slopes of the mountain: and there\nI found by far the greatest of the caves which I saw, having ascended a\npath from the village to a hollow between two grass slopes, where there\nis a beck, and so entering an arch to the left, screened by trees, into\nthe limestone cliff. The passage narrows pretty rapidly inwards, and I\nhad not proceeded two yards before I saw the clear traces of a great\nbattle here. All this region had, in fact, been invaded, for the cave\nmust have been famous, though I did not remember it myself, and for some\nmiles round the dead were pretty frequent, making the immediate approach\nto the cave a matter for care, if the foot was to be saved from\npollution. It is clear that there had been an iron gate across the\nentrance, that within this a wall had been built across, shutting in I\ndo not know how many, perhaps one or two, perhaps hundreds: and both\ngate and wall had been stormed and broken down, for there still were the\nsledges and rocks which, without doubt, had done it. I had a lamp, and\nat my forehead the lighted candle, and I went on quickly, seeing it\nuseless now to choose my steps where there was no choice, through a\npassage incrusted, roof and sides, with a scabrous petrified lichen, the\nroof low for some ninety yards, covered with down-looking cones, like\nan inverted forest of children\'s toy-trees. I then came to a round hole,\napparently artificial, opening through a curtain of stalagmitic\nformation into a great cavern beyond, which was quite animated and\nfestal with flashes, sparkles, and diamond-lustres, hung in their\nmyriads upon a movement of the eye, these being produced by large\nnumbers of snowy wet stalagmites, very large and high, down the centre\nof which ran a continuous long lane of clothes and hats and faces; with\nhasty reluctant feet I somehow passed over them, the cave all the time\nwidening, thousands of stalactites appearing on the roof of every size,\nfrom virgin\'s breast to giant\'s club, and now everywhere the wet drip,\ndrip, as it were a populous busy bazaar of perspiring brows and hurrying\nfeet, in which the only business is to drip. Where stalactite meets\nstalagmite there are pillars: where stalactite meets stalactite in\nfissures long or short there are elegances, flimsy draperies, delicate\nfantasies; there were also pools of water in which hung heads and feet,\nand there were vacant spots at outlying spaces, where the arched roof,\nwhich continually heightened itself, was reflected in the chill gleam of\nthe floor. Suddenly, the roof came down, the floor went up, and they\nseemed to meet before me; but looking, I found a low opening, through\nwhich, drawing myself on the belly over slime for some yards in\nrepulsive proximity to dead personalities, I came out upon a floor of\nsand and pebbles under a long dry tunnel, arched and narrow, grim and\ndull, without stalactites, suggestive of monks, and catacomb-vaults, and\nthe route to the grave; and here the dead were much fewer, proving\neither that the general mob had not had time to penetrate so far inward,\nor else that those within, if they were numerous, had gone out to\ndefend, or to harken to, the storm of their citadel. This passage led me\ninto an open space, the grandest of all, loftily vaulted, full of genie\nriches and buried treasures of light, the million-fold _ensemble_ of\nlustres dancing schottishe with the eye, as it moved or was still: this\nplace, I should guess, being quite half a mile from the entrance. My\nprying lantern showed me here only nineteen dead, men of various\nnations, and at the far end two holes in the floor, large enough to\nadmit the body, through which from below came up a sound of falling\nwater. Both of these holes, I could see, had been filled with cement\nconcrete--wisely, I fancy, for a current of air from somewhere seemed to\nbe now passing through them: and this would have resulted in the death\nof the hiders. Both, however, of the fillings had been broken through,\none partially, the other wholly, by the ignorant, I presume, who\nthought to hide in a secret place yet beyond, where they may have\nbelieved, on seeing the artificial work, that others were. I had my ear\na long time at one of these openings, listening to that mysterious chant\ndown below in a darkness most murky and dismal; and afterwards, spurred\nby the stubborn will which I had to be thorough, I went back, took a\nnumber of outer robes from the bodies, tied them well together, then one\nend round the nearest pillar, and having put my mouth to the hole,\ncalling: _\'Anyone? Anyone?\'_ let myself down by the rope of garments,\nthe candle at my head: I had not, however, descended far into those\nmournful shades, when my right foot plunged into water: and instantly\nthe feeling of terror pierced me that all the evil things in the\nuniverse were at my leg to drag me down to Hell: and I was up quicker\nthan I went down: nor did my flight cease till, with a sigh of\ndeliverance, I found myself in open air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this, seeing that the autumn warmth was passing away, I set myself\nwith more system to my task, and within the next six months worked with\nsteadfast will, and strenuous assiduity, seeking, not indeed for a man\nin a mine, but for some evidence of the possibility that a man might be\nalive, visiting in that time Northumberland and Durham, Fife and\nKinross, South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cornwall and the Midlands, the\nlead mines of Derbyshire, of Allandale and other parts of\nNorthumberland, of Alston Moor and other parts of Cumberland, of\nArkendale and other parts of Yorkshire, of the western part of Durham,\nof Salop, of Cornwall, of the Mendip Hills of Somersetshire, of Flint,\nCardigan, and Montgomery, of Lanark and Argyll, of the Isle of Man, of\nWaterford and Down; I have gone down the 360-ft. Grand Pipe iron ladder\nof the abandoned graphite-mine at Barrowdale in Cumberland, half-way up\na mountain 2,000 feet high; and visited where cobalt and manganese ore\nis mined in pockets at the Foel Hiraeddog mine near Rhyl in Flintshire,\nand the lead and copper Newton Stewart workings in Galloway; the Bristol\ncoal-fields, and mines of South Staffordshire, where, as in Somerset,\nGloucester, and Shropshire, the veins are thin, and the mining-system is\nthe \'long-wall,\' whereas in the North, and Wales, the system is the\n\'pillar-and stall\'; I have visited the open workings for iron ores of\nNorthamptonshire, and the underground stone-quarries, and the\nunderground slate-quarries, with their alternate pillars and chambers,\nin the Festiniog district of North Wales; also the rock-salt workings;\nthe tin, copper and cobalt workings of Cornwall; and where the minerals\nwere brought to the surface on the backs of men, and where they were\nbrought by adit-levels provided with rail-roads, and where, as in old\nCornish mines, there are two ladders in the shaft, moved up and down\nalternately, see-saw, and by skipping from one to the other at right\nmoments you ascended or descended, and where the drawing-up is by a gin\nor horse-whinn, with vertical drum; the Tisbury and Chilmark quarries in\nWiltshire, the Spinkwell and Cliffwood quarries in Yorkshire; and every\ntunnel, and every recorded hole: for something urged within me, saying:\n\'You must be sure first, or you can never be--yourself.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the Farnbrook Coal-field, in the Red Colt Pit, my inexperience nearly\nended my life: for though I had a minute theoretical knowledge of all\nBritish workings, I was, in my practical relation to them, like a man\nwho has learnt seamanship on shore. At this place the dead were\naccumulated, I think beyond precedent, the dark plain around for at\nleast three miles being as strewn as a reaped field with stacks, and,\nnear the bank, much more strewn than stack-fields, filling the only\nhouse within sight of the pit-mouth--the small place provided for the\ncompany\'s officials--and even lying over the great mountain-heap of\nwark, composed of the shale and _dÃ©bris_ of the working. Here I arrived\non the morning of the 15th December, to find that, unlike the others,\nthere was here no rope-ladder or other contrivance fixed by the\nfugitives in the ventilating-shaft, which, usually, is not very deep,\nbeing also the pumping-shaft, containing a plug-rod at one end of the\nbeam-engine which works the pumps; but looking down the shaft, I\ndiscerned a vague mass of clothes, and afterwards a thing that could\nonly be a rope-ladder, which a batch of the fugitives, by hanging to it\ntheir united weight, must have dragged down upon themselves, to prevent\nthe descent of yet others. My only way of going down, therefore, was by\nthe pit-mouth, and as this was an important place, after some hesitation\nI decided, very rashly. First I provided for my coming up again by\ngetting a great coil of half-inch rope, which I found in the bailiff\'s\noffice, probably 130 fathoms long, rope at most mines being so\nplentiful, that it almost seemed as if each fugitive had provided\nhimself in that way. This length of rope I threw over the beam of the\nbeam-engine in the bite where it sustains the rod, and paid one end\ndown the shaft, till both were at the bottom: in this way I could come\nup, by tying one rope-end to the rope-ladder, hoisting it, fastening the\nother end below, and climbing the ladder; and I then set to work to\nlight the pit-mouth engine-fire to effect my descent. This done, I\nstarted the engine, and brought up the cage from the bottom, the 300\nyards of wire-rope winding with a quaint deliberateness round the drum,\nreminding me of a camel\'s nonchalant leisurely obedience. When I saw the\nfour meeting chains of the cage-roof emerge, the pointed roof, and\ntwo-sided frame, I stopped the ascent, and next attached to the\nknock-off gear a long piece of twine which I had provided; carried the\nother end to the cage, in which I had five companions; lit my\nhat-candle, which was my test for choke-damp, and the Davy; and without\nthe least reflection, pulled the string. That hole was 900 feet deep.\nFirst the cage gave a little up-leap, and then began to descend--quite\nnormally, I thought, though the candle at once went out--nor had I the\nleast fear; a strong current of air, indeed, blew up the shaft: but that\nhappens in shafts. _This_ current, however, soon became too vehemently\nboisterous for anything: I saw the lamp-light struggle, the dead cheeks\nquiver, I heard the cage-shoes go singing down the wire-rope guides,\nand quicker we went, and quicker, that facile descent of Avernus,\nslipping lightly, then raging, with sparks at the shoes and guides, and\na hurricane in my ears and eyes and mouth. When we bumped upon the\n\'dogs\' at the bottom, I was tossed a foot upwards with the stern-faced\nothers, and then lay among them in the eight-foot space without\nconsciousness.\n\nIt was only when I sat, an hour later, disgustedly reflecting on this\nincident, that I remembered that there was always some \'hand-working\' of\nthe engine during the cage-descents, an engineman reversing the action\nby a handle at every stroke of the piston, to prevent bumping. However,\nthe only permanent injury was to the lamp: and I found many others\ninside.\n\nI got out into the coal-hole, a large black hall 70 feet square by 15\nhigh, the floor paved with iron sheets; there were some little holes\nround the wall, dug for some purpose which I never could discover, some\nwaggons full of coal and shale standing about, and all among the\nwaggons, and on them, and under them, bodies, clothes. I got a new lamp,\npouring in my own oil, and went down a long steep ducky-road, very\nrough, with numerous rollers, over which ran a rope to the pit-mouth\nfor drawing up the waggons; and in the sides here, at regular intervals,\nman-holes, within which to rescue one\'s self from down-tearing waggons;\nand within these man-holes, here and there, a dead, and in others every\nsort of food, and at one place on the right a high dead heap, and the\nair here hot at 64 or 65 degrees, and getting hotter with the descent.\n\nThe ducky led me down into a standing--a space with a turn-table--of\nunusual size, which I made my base of operations for exploring. Here was\na very considerable number of punt-shaped putts on carriages, and also\nwaggons, such as took the new-mined coal from putt to pit-mouth; and\nraying out from this open standing, several avenues, some ascending as\nguggs, some descending as dipples, and the dead here all arranged in\ngroups, the heads of this group pointing up this gugg, of that group\ntoward that twin-way, of that other down that dipple, and the central\nspace, where weighing was done, almost empty: and the darksome silence\nof this deep place, with all these multitudes, I found extremely\ngravitating and hypnotic, drawing me, too, into their great Passion of\nSilence in which they lay, all, all, so fixed and veteran; and at one\ntime I fell a-staring, nearer perhaps to death and the empty Gulf than\nI knew; but I said I would be strong, and not sink into their habit of\nstillness, but let them keep to their own way, and follow their own\nfashion, and I would keep to my own way, and follow my own fashion, nor\nyield to them, though I was but one against many; and I roused myself\nwith a shudder; and setting to work, caught hold of the drum-chain of a\nlong gugg, and planting my feet in the chogg-holes in which rested the\nwheels of the putt-carriages that used to come roaring down the gugg, I\ngot up, stooping under a roof only three feet high, till I came, near\nthe end of the ascent, upon the scene of another battle: for in this\ngugg about fifteen of the mine-hands had clubbed to wall themselves in,\nand had done it, and I saw them lie there all by themselves through the\nbroken cement, with their bare feet, trousers, naked bodies all black,\nvisage all fierce and wild, the grime still streaked with sweat-furrows,\nthe candle in their rimless hats, and, outside, their own \'getting\'\nmattocks and boring-irons to besiege them. From the bottom of this gugg\nI went along a very undulating twin-way, into which, every thirty yards\nor so, opened one of those steep putt-ways which they called topples,\nthe twin-ways having plates of about 2-1/2 ft. gauge for the putts from\nthe headings, or workings, above to come down upon, full of coal and\nshale: and all about here, in twin-way and topples, were ends and\ncorners, and not one had been left without its walling-in, and only one\nwas then intact, some, I fancied, having been broken open by their own\nbuilders at the spur of suffocation, or hunger; and the one intact I\nbroke into with a mattock--it was only a thin cake of plaster, but\nair-tight--and in a space not seven feet long behind it I found the very\nill-smelling corpse of a carting-boy, with guss and tugger at his feet,\nand the pad which protected his head in pushing the putts, and a great\nheap of loaves, sardines, and bottled beer against the walls, and five\nor six mice that suddenly pitched screaming through the opening which I\nmade, greatly startling me, there being of dead mice an extraordinary\nnumber in all this mine-region. I went back to the standing, and at one\npoint in the ground, where there was a windlass and chain, lowered\nmyself down a \'cut\'--a small pit sunk perpendicularly to a lower\ncoal-stratum, and here, almost thinking I could hear the perpetual\nrat-tat of notice once exchanged between the putt-boys below and the\nwindlass-boys above, I proceeded down a dipple to another place like a\nstanding, for in this mine there were six, or perhaps seven, veins: and\nthere immediately I came upon the acme of the horrible drama of this\nTartarus, for all here was not merely crowded, but, at some points, a\npacked congestion of flesh, giving out a strong smell of the peach,\ncuriously mixed with the stale coal-odour of the pit, for here\nventilation must have been very limited; and a large number of these\nmasses had been shot down by only three hands, as I found: for through\nthree hermetical holes in a plaster-wall, built across a large gugg,\nprojected a little the muzzles of three rifles, which must have glutted\nthemselves with slaughter; and when, after a horror of disgust, having\nswum as it were through a dead sea, I got to the wall, I peeped from a\nsmall clear space before it through a hole, and made out a man, two\nyouths in their teens, two women, three girls, and piles of cartridges\nand provisions; the hole had no doubt been broken from within at the\nspur of suffocation, when the poison must have entered; and I\nconjectured that here must be the mine-owner, director, manager, or\nsomething of that sort, with his family. In another dipple-region, when\nI had re-ascended to a higher level, I nearly fainted before I could\nretire from the commencement of a region of after-damp, where there had\nbeen an explosion, the bodies lying all hairless, devastated, and\ngrotesque. But I did not desist from searching every other quarter, no\nmomentary work, for not till near six did I go up by the pumping-shaft\nrope-ladder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne day, standing in that wild region of bare rock and sea, called\nCornwall Point, whence one can see the crags and postillion wild rocks\nwhere Land\'s End dashes out into the sea, and all the wild blue sea\nbetween, and not a house in sight, save the chimney of some little\nmill-like place peeping between the rocks inland--on that day I finished\nwhat I may call my official search.\n\nIn going away from that place, walking northward, I came upon a lonely\nhouse by the sea, a very beautiful house, made, it was clear, by an\nartist, of the bungalow type, with an exquisitely sea-side expression. I\nwent to it, and found its special feature a spacious loggia or verandah,\nsheltered by the overhanging upper story. Up to the first floor, the\nexterior is of stone in rough-hewn blocks with a distinct batter, while\nextra protection from weather is afforded by green slating above. The\nroofs, of low pitch, are also covered with green slates, and a feeling\nof strength and repose is heightened by the very long horizontal lines.\nAt one end of the loggia is a hexagonal turret, opening upon the loggia,\ncontaining a study or nook. In front, the garden slopes down to the\nsea, surrounded by an architectural sea-wall; and in this place I lived\nthree weeks. It was the house of the poet Machen, whose name, when I saw\nit, I remembered very well, and he had married a very beautiful young\ngirl of eighteen, obviously Spanish, who lay on the bed in the large\nbright bedroom to the right of the loggia, on her left exposed breast\nbeing a baby with an india-rubber comforter in its mouth, both mother\nand child wonderfully preserved, she still quite lovely, white brow\nunder low curves of black hair. The poet, strange to say, had not died\nwith them, but sat in the sitting-room behind the bedroom in a long\nloose silky-grey jacket, at his desk--actually writing a poem! writing,\nI could see, furiously fast, the place all littered with the written\nleaves--at three o\'clock in the morning, when, as I knew, the cloud\novertook this end of Cornwall, and stopped him, and put his head to rest\non the desk; and the poor little wife must have got sleepy, waiting for\nit to come, perhaps sleepless for many long nights before, and gone to\nbed, he perhaps promising to follow in a minute to die with her, but\nbent upon finishing that poem, and writing feverishly on, running a race\nwith the cloud, thinking, no doubt, \'just two couplets more,\' till the\nthing came, and put his head to rest on the desk, poor carle: and I do\nnot know that I ever encountered aught so complimentary to my race as\nthis dead poet Machen, and his race with the cloud: for it is clear now\nthat the better kind of those poet men did not write to please the vague\ninferior tribes who might read them, but to deliver themselves of the\ndivine warmth that thronged in their bosom; and if all the readers were\ndead, still they would have written; and for God to read they wrote. At\nany rate, I was so pleased with these poor people, that I stayed with\nthem three weeks, sleeping under blankets on a couch in the\ndrawing-room, a place full of lovely pictures and faded flowers, like\nall the house: for I would not touch the young mother to remove her. And\nfinding on Machen\'s desk a big note-book with soft covers, dappled red\nand yellow, not yet written in, I took it, and a pencil, and in the\nlittle turret-nook wrote day after day for hours this account of what\nhas happened, nearly as far as it has now gone. And I think that I may\ncontinue to write it, for I find in it a strange consolation, and\ncompanionship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the Severn Valley, somewhere in the plain between Gloucester and\nCheltenham, in a rather lonely spot, I at that time travelling on a\ntricycle-motor, I spied a curious erection, and went to it. I found it\nof considerable size, perhaps fifty feet square, and thirty high, made\nof pressed bricks, the perfectly flat roof, too, of brick, and not one\nwindow, and only one door: this door, which I found open, was rimmed all\nround its slanting rims with india-rubber, and when closed must have\nbeen perfectly air-tight. Just inside I came upon fifteen English people\nof the dressed class, except two, who were evidently bricklayers: six\nladies, and nine men: and at the further end, two more, men, who had\ntheir throats cut; along one wall, from end to end were provisions; and\nI saw a chest full of mixed potassic chlorate and black oxide of\nmanganese, with an apparatus for heating it, and producing oxygen--a\nfoolish thing, for additional oxygen could not alter the quantity of\nbreathed carbonic anhydride, which is a direct narcotic poison. Whether\nthe two with cut throats had sacrificed themselves for the others when\nbreathing difficulties commenced, or been killed by the others, was not\nclear. When they could bear it no longer, they must have finally opened\nthe door, hoping that by then, after the passage of many days perhaps,\nthe outer air would be harmless, and so met their death. I believe that\nthis erection must have been run up by their own hands under the\ndirection of the two bricklayers, for they could not, I suppose, have\ngot workmen, except on the condition of the workmen\'s admission: on\nwhich condition they would naturally employ as few as possible.\n\nIn general, I remarked that the rich must have been more urgent and\nearnest in seeking escape than the others: for the poor realised only\nthe near and visible, lived in to-day, and cherished the always-false\nnotion that to-morrow would be just like to-day. In an out-patients\'\nwaiting-room, for instance, in the Gloucester infirmary, I chanced to\nsee an astonishing thing: five bodies of poor old women in shawls, come\nto have their ailments seen-to on the day of doom; and these, I\nconcluded, had been unable to realise that anything would really happen\nto the daily old earth which they knew, and had walked with assurance\non: for if everybody was to die, they must have thought, who would\npreach in the Cathedral on Sunday evenings?--so they could not have\nbelieved. In an adjoining room sat an old doctor at a table, the\nstethoscope-tips still clinging in his ears: a woman with bared chest\nbefore him; and I thought to myself: \'Well, this old man, too, died\ndoing his work....\'\n\nIn this same infirmary there was one surgical ward--for in a listless\nmood I went over it--where the patients had died, not of the poison, nor\nof suffocation, but of hunger: for the doctors, or someone, had made the\nlong room air-tight, double-boarding the windows, felting the doors, and\nthen locking them outside; they themselves may have perished before\ntheir precautions for the imprisoned patients were complete: for I found\na heap of maimed shapes, mere skeletons, crowded round the door within.\nI knew very well that they had not died of the cloud-poison, for the\npestilence of the ward was unmixed with that odour of peach which did\nnot fail to have more or less embalming effects upon the bodies which it\nsaturated. I rushed stifling from that place; and thinking it a pity,\nand a danger, that such a horror should be, I at once set to work to\ngather combustibles to burn the building to the ground.\n\nIt was while I sat in an arm-chair in the street the next afternoon,\nsmoking, and watching the flames of this structure, that something was\nsuddenly born in me, something from the lowest Hell: and I smiled a\nsmile that never yet man smiled. And I said: \'I will burn, I will burn:\nI will return to London....\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was on this Eastward journey, stopping for the night at the\ntown of Swindon, I had a dream: for I dreamed that a little brown bald\nold man, with a bent back, whose beard ran in one thin streamlet of\nsilver from his chin to trail along the ground, said to me: \'You think\nthat you are alone on the earth, its sole Despot: well, have your fling:\nbut as sure as God lives, as God lives, as God lives\'--he repeated it\nsix times--\'sooner or later, later or sooner, you will meet another....\'\n\nAnd I started from that frightful sleep with the brow of a corpse, wet\nwith sweat....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to London on the 29th of March, arriving within a hundred\nyards of the Northern Station one windy dark evening about eight, where\nI alighted, and walked to Euston Road, then eastward along it, till I\ncame to a shop which I knew to be a jeweller\'s, though it was too dark\nto see any painted words. The door, to my annoyance, was locked, like\nnearly all the shop-doors in London: I therefore went looking near the\nground, and into a cart, for something heavy, very soon saw a labourer\'s\nponderous boots, cut one from the shrivelled foot, and set to beat at\nthe glass till it came raining; then knocked away the bottom splinters,\nand entered.\n\nNo horrors now at that clatter of broken glass; no sick qualms; my\npulse steady; my head high; my step royal; my eye cold and calm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEight months previously, I had left London a poor burdened, cowering\nwight. I could scream with laughter now at that folly! But it did not\nlast long. I returned to it--the Sultan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo private palace being near, I was going to that great hotel in\nBloomsbury: but though I knew that numbers of candle-sticks would be\nthere, I was not sure that I should find sufficient: for I had acquired\nthe habit within the past few months of sleeping with at least sixty\nlighted about me, and their form, pattern, style, age, and material was\nof no small importance I selected ten from the broken shop, eight gold\nand silver, and two of old ecclesiastical brass, and having made a\nbundle, went out, found a bicycle at the Metropolitan Station, pumped\nit, tied my bundle to the handle-bar, and set off riding. But since I\nwas too lazy to walk, I should certainly have procured some other means\nof travelling, for I had not gone ten jolted and creaking yards, when\nsomething went snap--it was a front fork--and I found myself half on\nthe ground, and half across the bare knees of a Highland soldier. I flew\nwith a shower of kicks upon the foolish thing: but that booted nothing;\nand this was my last attempt in that way in London, the streets being in\nan unsuitable condition.\n\nAll that dismal night it blew great guns: and during nearly three weeks,\ntill London was no more, there was a storm, with hardly a lull, that\nseemed to behowl her destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI slept in a room on the second-floor of a Bloomsbury hotel that night;\nand waking the next day at ten, ate with accursed shiverings in the cold\nbanqueting-room; went out then, and under drear low skies walked a long\nway to the West district, accompanied all the time by a sound of\nflapping flags--fluttering robes and rags--and grotesquely grim glimpses\nof decay. It was pretty cold, and though I was warmly clad, the base\n_bizarrerie_ of the European clothes which I wore had become a perpetual\noffence and mockery in my eyes: at the first moment, therefore, I set\nout whither I knew that I should find such clothes as a man might wear:\nto the Turkish Embassy in Bryanston Square.\n\nI found it open, and all the house, like most other houses, almost\ncarpeted with dead forms. I had been acquainted with Redouza Pasha, and\ncast an eye about for him amid that invasion of veiled hanums,\nfierce-looking Caucasians in skins of beasts, a Sheik-ul-Islam in green\ncloak, a khalifa, three emirs in cashmere turbans, two tziganes, their\ngaudy brown mortality more glaringly abominable than even the Western\'s.\nI could recognise no Redouza here: but the stair was fairly clear, and I\nsoon came to one of those boudoirs which sweetly recall the deep-buried\ninner seclusion and dim sanctity of the Eastern home: a door encrusted\nwith mother-of-pearl, sculptured ceiling, candles clustered in tulips\nand roses of opal, a brazen brasero, and, all in disarray, the silken\nchemise, the long winter-cafetan doubled with furs, costly cabinets,\nsachets of aromas, babooshes, stuffs of silk. When, after two hours, I\nwent from the house, I was bathed, anointed, combed, scented, and robed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have said to myself: \'I will ravage and riot in my Kingdoms. I will\nrage like the Caesars, and be a withering blight where I pass like\nSennacherib, and wallow in soft delights like Sardanapalus. I will build\nme a palace, vast as a city, in which to strut and parade my Monarchy\nbefore the Heavens, with stones of pure molten gold, and rough\nfrontispiece of diamond, and cupola of amethyst, and pillars of pearl.\nFor there were many men to the eye: but there was One only, really: and\nI was he. And always I knew it:--some faintest secret whisper which\nwhispered me: ""_You_ are the Arch-one, the _motif_ of the world, Adam,\nand the rest of men not much."" And they are gone--all! all!--as no doubt\nthey deserved: and I, as was meet, remain. And there are wines, and\nopiums, and haschish; and there are oils, and spices, fruits and\nbivalves, and soft-breathing Cyclades, and scarlet luxurious Orients. I\nwill be restless and turbulent in my territories: and again, I will be\nlanguishing and fond. I will say to my soul: ""Be Full.""\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI watch my mind, as in the old days I would watch a new precipitate in a\ntest-tube, to see into what sediment it would settle.\n\nI am very averse to trouble of any sort, so that the necessity for the\nsimplest manual operations will rouse me to indignation: but if a thing\nwill contribute largely to my ever-growing voluptuousness, I will\nundergo a considerable amount of labour to accomplish it, though\nwithout steady effort, being liable to side-winds and whims, and\npurposeless relaxations.\n\nIn the country I became very irritable at the need which confronted me\nof occasionally cooking some green vegetable--the only item of food\nwhich it was necessary to take some trouble over: for all meats, and\nmany fish, some quite delicious, I find already prepared in forms which\nwill remain good probably a century after my death, should I ever die.\nIn Gloucester, however, I found peas, asparagus, olives, and other\ngreens, already prepared to be eaten without base cares: and these, I\nnow see, exist everywhere in stores so vast comparatively to the needs\nof a single man, that they may be called infinite. Everything, in fact,\nis infinite compared with my needs. I take my meals, therefore, without\nmore trouble than a man who had to carve his joint, or chicken: though\neven that little I sometimes find most irksome. There remains the\ndetestable degradation of lighting fires for warmth, which I have\noccasionally to do: for the fire at the hotel invariably goes out while\nI sleep. But that is an inconvenience of this vile northern island only,\nto which I shall soon bid eternal glad farewells.\n\nDuring the afternoon of my second day in London, I sought out a strong\npetrol motor in Holborn, overhauled and oiled it a little, and set off\nover Blackfriars Bridge, making for Woolwich through that other more\nputrid London on the south river-side. One after the other, I connected,\nas I came upon them, two drays, a cab, and a private carriage, to my\nmotor in line behind, having cut away the withered horses, and using the\nreins, chain-harness, &c., as impromptu couplings. And with this novel\ntrain, I rumbled eastward.\n\nHalf-way I happened to look at my old silver chronometer of\n_Boreal_-days, which I have kept carefully wound--and how I can be still\nthrown into these sudden frantic agitations by a nothing, a nothing, my\ngood God! I do not know. This time it was only the simple fact that the\nhands chanced to point to 3.10 P.M., the precise moment at which all the\nclocks of London had stopped--for each town has its thousand weird\nfore-fingers, pointing, pointing still, to the moment of doom. In London\nit was 3.10 on a Sunday afternoon. I first noticed it going up the river\non the face of the \'Big Ben\' of the Parliament-house, and I now find\nthat they all, all, have this 3.10 mania, time-keepers still, but\nkeepers of the end of Time, fixedly noting for ever and ever that one\nmoment. The cloud-mass of fine penetrating _scoriae_ must have instantly\nstopped their works, and they had fallen silent with man. But in their\ninsistence upon this particular minute I had found something so\nhideously solemn, yet mock-solemn, personal, and as it were addressed to\n_me_, that when my own watch dared to point to the same moment, I was\nthrown into one of those sudden, paroxysmal, panting turmoils of mind,\nhalf rage, half horror, which have hardly once visited me since I left\nthe _Boreal_. On the morrow, alas, another awaited me; and again on the\nsecond morrow after.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy train was execrably slow, and not until after five did I arrive at\nthe entrance-gates of the Woolwich Royal Arsenal; and seeing that it was\ntoo late to work, I uncoupled the motor, and leaving the others there,\nturned back; but overtaken by lassitude, I procured candles, stopped at\nthe Greenwich Observatory, and in that old dark pile, remained for the\nnight, listening to a furious storm. But, a-stir by eight the next\nmorning, I got back by ten to the Arsenal, and proceeded to analyse that\nvast and multiple entity. Many parts of it seemed to have been abandoned\nin undisciplined haste, and in the Cap Factory, which I first entered, I\nfound tools by which to effect entry into any desired part. My first\nsearch was for time-fuses of good type, of which I needed two or three\nthousand, and after a wearily long time found a great number\nsymmetrically arranged in rows in a range of buildings called the\nOrdnance Store Department. I then descended, walked back to the wharf,\nbrought up my train, and began to lower the fuses in bag-fulls by ropes\nthrough a shoot, letting go each rope as the fuses reached the cart.\nHowever, on winding one fuse, I found that the mechanism would not go,\nchoked with scoriae; and I had to resign myself to the task of opening\nand dusting every one: a wretched labour in which I spent that day, like\na workman. But about four I threw them to the devil, having done two\nhundred odd, and then hummed back in the motor to London.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat same evening at six I paid, for the first time, a visit to my old\nself in Harley Street. It was getting dark, and a bleak storm that\nhooted like whooping-cough swept the world. At once I saw that even _I_\nhad been invaded: for my door swung open, banging, a lowered catch\npreventing it from slamming; in the passage the car-lamp shewed me a\nyoung man who seemed a Jew, sitting as if in sleep with dropped head, a\nback-tilted silk-hat pressed down upon his head to the ears; and lying\non face, or back, or side, six more, one a girl with Arlesienne\nhead-dress, one a negress, one a Deal lifeboat\'s-man, and three of\nuncertain race; the first room--the waiting-room--is much more\nnumerously occupied, though there still, on the table, lies the volume\nof _Punch_, the _Gentlewoman_, and the book of London views in\nheliograph. Behind this, descending two steps, is the study and\nconsulting-room, and there, as ever, the revolving-cover oak\nwriting-desk: but on my little shabby-red sofa, a large lady much too\nbig for it, in shimmering brown silk, round her left wrist a _trousseau_\nof massive gold trinkets, her head dropped right back, almost severed by\nan infernal gash from the throat. Here were two old silver\ncandle-sticks, which I lit, and went upstairs: in the drawing-room sat\nmy old house-keeper, placidly dead in a rocking-chair, her left hand\npressing down a batch of the open piano-keys, among many strangers. But\nshe was very good: she had locked my bedroom against intrusion; and as\nthe door stands across a corner behind a green-baize curtain, it had not\nbeen seen, or, at least, not forced. I did not know where the key might\nbe, but a few thumps with my back drove it open: and there lay my bed\nintact, and everything tidy. This was a strange coming-back to it, Adam.\n\nBut what intensely interested me in that room was a big thing standing\nat the maroon-and-gold wall between wardrobe and dressing-table--that\ngilt frame--and that man painted within it there. It was myself in oils,\ndone by--I forget his name now: a towering celebrity he was, and rather\na close friend of mine at one time. In a studio in St. John\'s Wood, I\nremember, he did it; and many people said that it was quite a great work\nof art. I suppose I was standing before it quite thirty minutes that\nnight, holding up the bits of candle, lost in wonder, in amused contempt\nat that thing there. It is I, certainly: that I must admit. There is the\nhigh-curving brow--really a King\'s brow, after all, it strikes me\nnow--and that vacillating look about the eyes and mouth which used to\nmake my sister Ada say: \'Adam is weak and luxurious.\' Yes, that is\nwonderfully done, the eyes, that dear, vacillating look of mine; for\nalthough it is rather a staring look, yet one can almost see the dark\npupils stir from side to side: very well done. And there is the longish\nface; and the rather thin, stuck-out moustache, shewing both lips which\npout a bit; and there is the nearly black hair; and there is the rather\nvisible paunch; and there is, oh good Heaven, the neat pink cravat--ah,\nit must have been _that--the cravat_--that made me burst out into\nlaughter so loud, mocking, and uncontrollable the moment my eye rested\nthere! \'Adam Jeffson,\' I muttered reproachfully when it was over, \'could\nthat poor thing in the frame have been you?\'\n\nI cannot quite state why the tendency toward Orientalism--Oriental\ndress--all the manner of an Oriental monarch--has taken full possession\nof me: but so it is: for surely I am hardly any longer a Western,\n\'modern\' mind, but a primitive and Eastern one. Certainly, that cravat\nin the frame has receded a million, million leagues, ten thousand\nforgotten aeons, from me! Whether this is a result due to my own\npersonality, of old acquainted with Eastern notions, or whether,\nperhaps, it is the natural accident to any mind wholly freed from\ntrammels, I do not know. But I seem to have gone right back to the very\nbeginnings, and resemblance with man in his first, simple, gaudy\nconditions. My hair, as I sit here writing, already hangs a black, oiled\nstring down my back; my scented beard sweeps in two opening whisks to my\nribs; I have on the _izar_, a pair of drawers of yomani cloth like\ncotton, but with yellow stripes; over this a soft shirt, or quamis, of\nwhite silk, reaching to my calves; over this a short vest of\ngold-embroidered crimson, the _sudeyree_; over this a khaftan of\ngreen-striped silk, reaching to the ankles, with wide, long sleeves\ndivided at the wrist, and bound at the waist with a voluminous gaudy\nshawl of Cashmere for girdle; over this a warm wide-flowing torrent of\nwhite drapery, lined with ermine. On my head is the skull-cap, covered\nby a high crimson cap with deep-blue tassel; and on my feet is a pair of\nthin yellow-morocco shoes, covered over with thick red-morocco\nbabooshes. My ankles--my ten fingers--my wrists--are heavy with gold and\nsilver ornaments; and in my ears, which, with considerable pain, I bored\nthree days since, are two needle-splinters, to prepare the holes for\nrings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO Liberty! I am free....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was going to visit my old home in Harley Street that night, at\nthe very moment when I turned from Oxford Street into Cavendish Square,\nthis thought, fiercely hissed into my ears, was all of a sudden seething\nin me: \'If now I should lift my eyes, and see a man walking yonder--just\nyonder--_at the corner there_--turning from Harewood Place into Oxford\nStreet--what, my good God, should I do?--I without even a knife to run\nand plunge into his heart?\'\n\nAnd I turned my eyes--ogling, suspicious eyes of furtive\nhorror--reluctantly, lingeringly turned--and I peered deeply with\nlowered brows across the murky winds at that same spot: but no man was\nthere.\n\nHideously frequent is this nonsense now become with me--in streets of\ntowns--in deep nooks of the country: the invincible assurance that, if I\nbut turn the head, and glance _there_--at a certain fixed spot--I shall\nsurely see--I _must_ see--a man. And glance I must, glance I must,\nthough I perish: and when I glance, though my hairs creep and stiffen\nlike stirring amobse, yet in my eyes, I know, is monarch indignation\nagainst the intruder, and my neck stands stiff as sovereignty itself,\nand on my brow sits more than all the lordship of Persepolis and Iraz.\n\nTo what point of wantonness this arrogance of royalty may lead me, I do\nnot know: I will watch, and see. It is written: \'It is not good for man\nto be alone!\' But good or no, the arrangement of One planet, One\ninhabitant, already seems to me, not merely a natural and proper, but\nthe _only_ natural and proper, condition; so much so, that any other\narrangement has now, to my mind, a certain improbable, wild, and\nfar-fetched unreality, like the Utopian schemes of dreamers and\nfaddists. That the whole world should have been made for _me_\nalone--that London should have been built only in order that _I_ might\nenjoy the vast heroic spectacle of its burning--that all history, and\nall civilisation should have existed only in order to accumulate for\n_my_ pleasures its inventions and facilities, its stores of purple and\nwine, of spices and gold--no more extraordinary does it all seem to me\nthan to some little unreflecting Duke of my former days seemed the\npossessing of lands which his remote forefathers seized, and slew the\noccupiers: nor, in reality, is it even so extraordinary, I being alone.\nBut what sometimes strikes me with some surprise is, not that the\npresent condition of the world, with one sole master, should seem the\ncommon-place and natural condition, but that it should have come to seem\n_so_ common-place and natural--in nine months. The mind of Adam Jeffson\nis adaptable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat a long time thinking such things by my bed that night, till\nfinally I was disposed to sleep there. But I had no considerable number\nof candle-sticks, nor was even sure of candles. I remembered, however,\nthat Peter Peters, three doors away on the other side of the street,\nhad had four handsome silver candelabra in his drawing-room, each\ncontaining six stems; and I said to myself: \'I will search for candles\nin the kitchen, and if I find any, I will go and get Peter Peters\'\ncandelabra, and sleep here.\'\n\nI took then the two lights which I had, my good God; went down to the\npassage; then down to the basement; and there had no difficulty in\nfinding three packets of large candles, the fact being, I suppose, that\nthe cessation of gas-lighting had compelled everyone to provide\nthemselves in this way, for there were a great many wherever I looked.\nWith these I re-ascended, went into a little alcove on the second-floor\nwhere I had kept some drugs, got a bottle of carbolic oil, and for ten\nminutes went dashing all the corpses in the house. I then left the two\nlighted bits of candle on the waiting-room table, and, with the\ncar-lamp, passed along the passage to the front-door, which was very\nviolently banging. I stepped out to find that the storm had increased to\na mighty turbulence (though it was dry), which at once caught my\nclothes, and whirled them into a flapping cloud about and above me;\nalso, I had not crossed the street when my lamp was out. I persisted,\nhowever, half blinded, to Peters door. It was locked: but immediately\nnear the pavement was a window, the lower sash up, into which, with\nlittle trouble, I lifted myself and passed. My foot, as I lowered it,\nstood on a body: and this made me angry and restless. I hissed a curse,\nand passed on, scraping the carpet with my soles, that I might hurt no\none: for I did not wish to hurt any one. Even in the almost darkness of\nthe room I recognised Peters\' furniture, as I expected: for the house\nwas his on a long lease, and I knew that his mother had had the\nintention to occupy it after his death. But as I passed into the\npassage, all was mere blank darkness, and I, depending upon the lamp,\nhad left the matches in the other house. I groped my way to the stairs,\nand had my foot on the first step, when I was stopped by a vicious\nshaking of the front-door, which someone seemed to be at with hustlings\nand the most urgent poundings: I stood with peering stern brows two or\nthree minutes, for I knew that if I once yielded to the flinching at my\nheart, no mercy would be shown me in this house of tragedy, and\nthrilling shrieks would of themselves arise and ring through its haunted\nchambers. The rattling continued an inordinate time, and so instant and\nimperative, that it seemed as if it could not fail to force the door.\nBut, though horrified, I whispered to my heart that it could only be the\nstorm which was struggling at it like the grasp of a man, and after a\ntime went on, feeling my way by the broad rail, in my brain somehow the\nthought of a dream which I had had in the _Boreal_ of the woman Clodagh,\nhow she let drop a fluid like pomegranate-seeds into water, and tendered\nit to Peter Peters: and it was a mortal purging draught; but I would not\nstop, but step by step went up, though I suffered very much, my brows\npeering at the utter darkness, and my heart shocked at its own rashness.\nI got to the first landing, and as I turned to ascend the second part of\nthe stair, my left hand touched something icily cold: I made some quick\ninstinctive movement of terror, and, doing so, my foot struck against\nsomething, and I stumbled, half falling over what seemed a small table\nthere. Immediately a horrible row followed, for something fell to the\nground: and at that instant, ah, I heard something--a voice--a human\nvoice, which uttered words close to my ear--the voice of Clodagh, for I\nknew it: yet not the voice of Clodagh in the flesh, but her voice\nclogged with clay and worms, and full of effort, and thick-tongued: and\nin that ghastly speech of the grave I distinctly heard the words:\n\n\'_Things being as they are in the matter of the death of Peter ..._\'\n\nAnd there it stopped dead, leaving me so sick, my God, so sick, that I\ncould hardly snatch my robes about me to fly, fly, fly, soft-footed,\nmurmuring in pain, down the steps, down like a sneaking thief, but\nquick, snatching myself away, then wrestling with the cruel catch of the\ndoor which she would not let me open, feeling her all the time behind\nme, watching me. And when I did get out, I was away up the length of the\nstreet, trailing my long _jubbah_, glancing backward, panting, for I\nthought that she might dare to follow, with her daring evil will. And\nall that night I lay on a common bench in the wind-tossed and dismal\nPark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing which I did when the sun was up was to return to that\nplace: and I returned with hard and masterful brow.\n\nApproaching Peters\' house I saw now, what the darkness had hidden from\nme, that on his balcony was someone--quite alone there. The balcony is a\nslight open-work wrought-iron structure, connected to a small roof by\nthree slender voluted pillars, two at the ends, one in the middle: and\nat the middle one I saw someone, a woman--kneeling--her arms clasped\ntight about the pillar, and her face rather upward-looking. Never did I\nsee aught more horrid: there were the gracious curves of the woman\'s\nbust and hips still well preserved in a clinging dress of red cloth,\nvery faded now; and her reddish hair floated loose in a large flimsy\ncloud about her; but her face, in that exposed position, had been quite\neaten away by the winds to a noseless skeleton, which grinned from ear\nto ear, with slightly-dropped under-jaw--most horrid in contrast with\nthe body, and frame of hair. I meditated upon her a long time that\nmorning from the opposite pavement. An oval locket at her throat\ncontained, I knew, my likeness: for eight years previously I had given\nit her. It was Clodagh, the poisoner.\n\nI thought that I would go into that house, and walk through it from top\nto bottom, and sit in it, and spit in it, and stamp in it, in spite of\nany one: for the sun was now high. I accordingly went in again, and up\nthe stairs to the spot where I had been frightened, and had heard the\nwords. And here a great rage took me, for I at once saw that I had been\nmade the dupe of the malign wills that beset me, and the laughing-stock\nof Those for whom I care not a fig. From a little mahogany table there I\nhad knocked sideways to the ground, in my stumble, a small phonograph\nwith a great 25-inch japanned-tin horn, which, the moment that I now\nnoticed it, I took and flung with a great racket down the stairs: for\nthat this it was which had addressed me I did not doubt; it being indeed\nevident that its clock-work mechanism had been stopped by the volcanic\nscoriae in the midst of the delivery of a record, but had been started\ninto a few fresh oscillations by the shock of the fall, making it utter\nthose thirteen words, and stop. I was sufficiently indignant at the\nmoment, but have since been glad, for I was thereby put upon the notion\nof collecting a number of cylinders with records, and have been touched\nwith indescribable sensations, sometimes thrilled, at hearing the\nsilence of this Eternity broken by those singing and speaking voices, so\nlife-like, yet most ghostly, of the old dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the most of that same day I spent in a high chamber at Woolwich,\ndusting out, and sometimes oiling, time-fuses: a work in which I\nacquired such facility in some hours, that each finally occupied me no\nmore than ninety to a hundred seconds, so that by evening I had, with\nthe previous day\'s work, close on 600. The construction of these little\nthings is very simple, and, I believe, effective, so that I should have\nno difficulty in making them myself in large numbers, if it were\nnecessary. Most contain a tiny dry battery, which sends a current along\na bell or copper wire at the running-down moment, the clocks being\ncontrived to be set for so many days, hours, and minutes, while others\nignite by striking. I arranged in rows in the covered van those which I\nhad prepared, and passed the night in an inn near the Barracks. I had\nbrought candle-sticks from London in the morning, and arranged the\nfurniture--a settee, chest-of-drawers, basin-stand, table, and a number\nof chairs--in three-quarter-circle round the bed, so getting a\ntriple-row altar of lights, mixed with vases of the house containing\nsmall palms and evergreens; with this I mingled a smell of ambergris\nfrom the scattered contents of some Turkish sachets which I had; in the\nbed a bottle of sweet Chypre-wine, with _bonbons_, nuts, and Havannas.\nAs I lay me down, I could not but reflect, with a smile which I knew to\nbe evil, upon that steady, strong, smouldering lust within me which was\nurging me through all those pains at the Arsenal, I who shirked every\nlabour as unkingly. So, however, it was: and the next morning I was at\nit again after an early breakfast, my fingers at first quite stiff with\ncold, for it blew a keen and January gale. By nine I had 820 fuses; and\njudging those sufficient to commence with, got into the motor, and took\nit round to a place called the East Laboratory, a series of detached\nbuildings, where I knew that I should find whatever I wanted: and I\nprepared my mind for a day\'s labour. In this place I found incredible\nstores: mountains of percussion-caps, more chambers of fuses, small-arm\ncartridges, shells, and all those murderous explosive mixtures, a-making\nand made, with which modern savagery occupied its leisure in\nexterminating itself: or, at least, savagery civilised in its top-story\nonly: for civilisation was apparently from the head downwards, and never\nonce grew below the neck in all those centuries, those people being\ncertainly much more mental than cordial, though I doubt if they were\ngenuinely mental either--reminding one rather of that composite image of\nNebuchadnezzar, head of gold, breast brazen, feet of clay--head\nman-like, heart cannibal, feet bestial--like aegipeds, and mermaids, and\npuzzling undeveloped births. However, it is of no importance: and\nperhaps I am not much better than the rest, for I, too, after all, am of\nthem. At any rate, their lyddites, melanites, cordites, dynamites,\npowders, jellies, oils, marls, and civilised barbarisms and obiahs, came\nin very well for their own destruction: for by two o\'clock I had so\nworked, that I had on the first cart the phalanx of fuses; on the\nsecond a goodly number of kegs, cartridge-cases and cartridge-boxes,\nfull of powder, explosive cottons and gelatines, and liquid\nnitro-glycerine, and earthy dynamite, with some bombs, two reels of\ncordite, two pieces of tarred cloth, a small iron ladle, a shovel, and a\ncrow-bar; the cab came next, containing a considerable quantity of loose\ncoal; and lastly, in the private carriage lay four big cans of common\noil. And first, in the Laboratory, I connected a fuse-conductor with a\nhuge tun of blasting-gelatine, and I set the fuse on the ground, timed\nfor the midnight of the twelfth day thence; and after that I visited the\nMain Factory, the Carriage Department, the Ordnance Store Department,\nthe Royal Artillery Barracks, and the Powder Magazines in the Marshes,\ntraversing, as it seemed to me, miles of building; and in some I laid\nheaps of oil-saturated coal with an explosive in suitable spots on the\nground-floor near wood-work, and in some an explosive alone: and all I\ntimed for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day. Hot now, and black as\nink, I proceeded through the town, stopping with perfect system at every\nhundredth door: and I laid the faggots of a great burning: and timed\nthem all for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever door I found closed against me I drove at it with a maniac\nmalice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShall I commit the whole dark fact to paper?--that deep, deep secret of\nthe human organism?\n\nAs I wrought, I waxed wicked as a demon! And with lowered neck, and\nforward curve of the lower spine, and the blasphemous strut of tragic\nplay-actors, I went. For here was no harmless burning which I did--but\nthe crime of arson; and a most fiendish, though vague, malevolence, and\nthe rage to burn and raven and riot, was upon me like a dog-madness, and\nall the mood of Nero, and Nebuchadnezzar: and from my mouth proceeded\nall the obscenities of the slum and of the gutter, and I sent up such\nhisses and giggles of challenge to Heaven that day as never yet has man\nlet out. But this way lies a spinning frenzy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have taken a dead girl with wild huggings to my bosom; and I have\ntouched the corrupted lip, and spat upon her face, and tossed her down,\nand crushed her teeth with my heel, and jumped and jumped upon her\nbreast, like the snake-stamping zebra, mad, mad...!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was desolated, however, that first day of the faggot-laying, even in\nthe midst of my sense of omnipotence, by one thing, which made me give\nsome kicks to the motor: for it was only crawling, so that a good part\nof the way I was stalking by its side; and when I came to that hill near\nthe Old Dover Road, the whole thing stopped, and refused to move, the\nweight of the train being too great for my horse-power traction. I did\nnot know what to do, and stood there in angry impotence a full\nhalf-hour, for the notion of setting up an electric station, with or\nwithout automatic stoking-gear, presented so hideous a picture of labour\nto me, that I would not entertain it. After a time, however, I thought\nthat I remembered that there was a comparatively new power station in\nSt. Paneras driven by turbines: and at once, I uncoupled the motor,\ncovered the drays with the tarpaulins, and went driving at singing\nspeed, choosing the emptier by-streets, and not caring whom I crushed.\nAfter some trouble I found, in fact, the station in an obscure by-street\nmade of two long walls, and went in by a window, a rage upon me to have\nmy will quickly accomplished. I ran up some stairs, across two rooms,\ninto a gallery containing a switch-board, and in the room below saw the\nworks, all very neat-looking, but, as I soon found, very dusty. I went\ndown, and fixed upon a generating set--there were three--that would give\na decent load, and then saw that the switch-gear belonging to this\nparticular generator was in order. I then got some cloths and thoroughly\ncleaned the dust off the commutators; ran next--for I was in a strange\nfierce haste--and turned the water into the turbines, and away went the\nengine; I hurried to set the lubricators running on the bearings, and in\na couple of minutes had adjusted the speed, and the brushes of the\ngenerators, and switched the current on to the line. By this time,\nhowever, I saw that it was getting dark, and feared that little could be\ndone that day; still, I hurried out, the station still running, got into\nthe car, and was off to look for a good electric one, of which there are\nhosts in the streets, in order at least to clean up and adjust the motor\nthat night. I drove down three by-streets, till I turned into Euston\nRoad: but I had no sooner reached it than I pulled up--with sudden\njerk--with a shout of astonishment.\n\nThat cursed street was all lighted up and gay! and three shimmering\nelectric globes, not far apart, illuminated every feature of a ghastly\nbattle-field of dead.\n\nAnd there was a thing there, the grinning impression of which I shall\ncarry to my grave: a thing which spelled and spelled at me, and ceased,\nand began again, and ceased, and spelled at me. For, above a shop which\nfaced me was a flag, a red flag with white letters, fluttering on the\ngale the words: \'Metcalfe\'s Stores\'; and beneath the flag, stretched\nright across the house, was the thing which spelled, letter by letter,\nin letters of light: and it spelled two words, deliberately, coming to\nthe end, and going back to recommence:\n\n  _Drink_\n  ROBORAL.\n\nAnd that was the last word of civilised Man to me, Adam Jeffson--its\nfinal counsel--its ultimate gospel and message--to _me_, my good God!\n_Drink Roboral!_\n\nI was put into such a passion of rage by this blatant ribaldry, which\naffected me like the laughter of a skeleton, that I rushed from the car,\nwith the intention, I believe, of seeking stones to stone it: but no\nstones were there: and I had to stand impotently enduring that rape of\nmy eyes, its victoriously-dogged iteration, its taunting leer, its\nDrink Roboral--D, R, I, N, K R, O, B, O, R, A, L.\n\nIt was one of those electrical spelling-advertisements, worked by a\nsmall motor commutator driven by a works-motor, and I had now set it\ngoing: for on some night before that Sabbath of doom the chemist must\nhave set it to work, but finding the works abandoned, had not troubled\nto shut it down again. At any rate, this thing stopped my work for that\nday, for when I went to shut down the works it was night; and I drove to\nthe place which I had made my home in sullen and weary mood: for I knew\nthat Roboral would not cure the least of all my sores.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning I awoke in quite another frame of mind, disposed to\nidle, and let things go. After rising, dressing, washing in cold diluted\nrose-water, and descending to the _salle-Ã\xa0-manger_, where I had laid my\nmorning-meal the previous evening, I promenaded an hour the only one of\nthese long sombrous tufted corridors in which there were not more than\ntwo dead, though behind the doors on either hand, all of which I had\nlocked, I knew that they lay in plenty. When I was warmed, I again went\ndown, looked into my motor, got three cylinders from one of a number of\nmotors standing near, lit up, and drove away--to Woolwich, as I thought\nat first: but instead of crossing the river by Blackfriars, I went more\neastward; and having passed from Holborn into Cheapside, which was\nimpassable, unless I crawled, was about to turn, when I noticed a\nphonograph-shop: into this I got by a side-door, suddenly seized by\nquite a curiosity to hear what I might hear. I took a good one with\nmicrophone diaphragm, and a number of record-cylinders in a\nbrass-handled box, and I put them into the car, for there was still a\nvery strong peach-odour in this closed shop, which displeased me. I then\nproceeded southward and westward through by-streets, seeking some\nprobable house into which to go from the rough cold winds, when I saw\nthe Parliament-house, and thither, turning river-ward by Westminster\nHall to Palace Yard, I went, and with my two parcels, one weighting each\narm, walked into this old place along a line of purple-dusted busts; I\ndeposited my boxes on a table beside a massive brass thing lying there,\nwhich, I suppose, must be what they called the Mace; and I sat to hear.\n\nUnfortunately, the phonograph was a clock-work one, and when I wound it,\nit would not go: so that I got very angry at my absurdity in not\nbringing an electric mechanism, as I could with much less trouble have\nput in a chemical than cleaned the clock-work; and this thing put me\ninto such a rage, that I nearly tore it to pieces, and was half for\nkicking it: but there was a man sitting in an old straight-backed chair\nquite near me, which they called the Speaker\'s Chair, who was in such a\npose, that he had, every time I glanced suddenly at him, precisely the\nair of bending forward with interest to watch what I was doing, a\nMohrgrabim kind of man, almost black, with Jewish nose, crinkled hair,\nkeffie, and flowing robe, probably, I should say, an Abyssinian Galla;\nwith him were only five or six people about the benches, mostly leaning\nforward with rested head, so that this place had quite a void\nsequestered mood. At all events, this Galla, or Bedouin, with his\ngrotesque interest in my doings, restrained my hands: and, finally, by\ndint of peering, poking, dusting, and adjusting, in an hour\'s time I got\nthe phonograph to go very well.\n\nAnd all that morning, and far into late afternoon, forgetful of food,\nand of the cold which gradually possessed me, I sat there listening,\nmusing--cylinder after cylinder: frivolous songs, orchestras, voices of\nfamous men whom I had spoken with, and shaken their solid hands,\nspeaking again to me, but thick-tongued, with hoarse effort and\ngurgles, from out the vague void beyond the grave: most strange, most\nstrange. And the third cylinder that I put on, ah, I knew, with a\nfearful start, that voice of thunder, I knew it well: it was the\npreacher, Mackay\'s; and many, many times over I heard those words of his\nthat day, originally spoken, it seems, when the cloud had just passed\nthe longitude of Vienna; and in all that torrent of speech not one\nsingle word of \'I told you so\': but he cries:\n\n\'...praise Him, O Earth, for He is He: and if He slay me, I will laugh\nraillery at His Sword, and banter Him to His face: for His Sword is\nsharp Mercy, and His poisons kill my death. Fear not, therefore, little\nflock of Man! but take my comfort to your heart to-night, and my sweets\nto your tongue: for though ye have sinned, and hardened yourselves as\nbrass, and gone far, far astray in these latter wildernesses, yet He is\ninfinitely greater than your sin, and will lead you back. Break not,\nbreak not, poor broken heart of Earth: for from Him I run herald to thee\nthis night with the sweet and secret message, that of old He chose thee,\nand once mixed conjugally with thee in an ancient sleep, O Afflicted:\nand He is thou, and thou art He, flesh of His flesh, and bone of His\nbone; and if thou perish utterly, it is that He has perished utterly,\ntoo: for thou art He. Hope, therefore, most, and cheeriest smile, at\nthe very apsis and black nadir of Despair: for He is nimble as a weasel,\nand He twists like Proteus, and His solstices and equinoxes, His tropics\nand turning-points and recurrences are innate in Being, and when He\nfalls He falls like harlequin and shuttlecocks, shivering plumb to His\nfeet, and each third day, lo, He is risen again, and His defeats are but\nthe stepping-stones and rough scaffolding from which He builds His\nParthenons, and from the densest basalt gush His rills, and the last end\nof this Earth shall be no poison-cloud, I say to you, but Carnival and\nHarvest-home ... though ye have sinned, poor hearts ...\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Mackay, with thick-tongued metallic effort. I found this brown room\nof the Commons-house, with its green benches, and grilled galleries, so\nagreeable to my mood, that I went again the next morning, and listened\nto more records, till they tired me: for what I had was a prurient itch\nto hear secret scandals, and revelations of the festering heart, but\nthese cylinders, gathered from a shop, divulged nothing. I then went out\nto make for Woolwich, but in the car saw the poet\'s note-book in which I\nhad written: and I took it, went back, and was writing an hour, till I\nwas tired of that, too; and judging it too late for Woolwich that day,\nwandered about the dusty committee-rooms and recesses of this\nconsiderable place. In one room another foolishness suddenly seized upon\nme, shewing how my slightest whim has become more imperious within me\nthan all the Jaws of the Medes and Persians: for in that room, Committee\nRoom No. 15, I found an apparently young policeman lying flat on his\nback, who pleased me: his helmet tilted under his head, and near one\nwhite-gloved hand a blue official envelope; the air of that stagnant\nquiet room was still perceptibly peach-scented, and he gave not the\nslightest odour that I could detect, though he had been corporal and\nstalwart, his face now the colour of dark ashes, in each hollow cheek a\nragged hole about the size of a sixpence, the flimsy vaulted eye-lids\nwell embedded in their caverns, from under whose fringe of eye-lash\nseemed whispered the word: \'_Eternity._\' His hair seemed very long for a\npoliceman, or perhaps it had grown since death; but what interested me\nabout him, was the envelope at his hand: for \'what,\' I asked myself,\n\'was this fellow doing here with an envelope at three o\'clock on a\nSunday afternoon?\' This made me look closer, and then I saw by a mark at\nthe left temple that he had been shot, or felled; whereupon I was\nthrown into quite a great rage, for I thought that this poor man was\nkilled in the execution of his duty, when many of his kind perhaps, and\nmany higher than he, had fled their post to pray or riot. So, after\nlooking at him a long time, I said to him: \'Well, D. 47, you sleep very\nwell: and you did well, dying so: I am pleased with you, and to mark my\nfavour, I decree that you shall neither rot in the common air, nor burn\nin the common flames: for by my own hand shall you be distinguished with\nburial.\' And this wind so possessed me, that I at once went out: with\nthe crow-bar from the car I broke the window of a near iron-monger\'s in\nParliament Street, got a spade, and went into Westminster Abbey. I soon\nprised up a grave-slab of some famous man in the north transept, and\ncommenced to shovel: but, I do not know how, by the time I had digged a\nfoot the whole impulse passed from me: I left off the work, promising to\nresume it: but nothing was ever done, for the next day I was at\nWoolwich, and busy enough about other matters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next nine days I worked with a fever on me, and a map of\nLondon before me.\n\nThere were places in that city!--secrets, vastnesses, horrors! In the\nwine-vaults at London Docks was a vat which must certainly have\ncontained between twenty and thirty thousand gallons: and with dancing\nheart I laid a train there; the tobacco-warehouse must have covered\neighty acres: and there I laid a fuse. In a house near Regent\'s Park,\nstanding in a garden, and shut from the street by a high wall, I saw a\nthing...! and what shapes a great city hid I now first know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI left no quarter unremembered, taking a train, no longer of four, but\nof eight, vehicles, drawn by an electric motor which I re-charged every\nmorning, mostly from the turbine station in St. Pancras, once from a\nsteam-station with very small engine and dynamo, found in the Palace\nTheatre, which gave little trouble, and once from a similar little\nstation in a Strand hotel. With these I visited West Ham and Kew,\nFinchley and Clapham, Dalston and Marylebone; I exhausted London; I\ndeposited piles in the Guildhall, in Holloway Gaol, in the new pillared\nJustice-hall of Newgate, in the Tower, in the Parliament-house, in St.\nGiles\' Workhouse, in the Crypt and under the organ of St. Paul\'s, in the\nSouth Kensington Museum, in the Royal Agricultural Society, in\nWhiteley\'s place, in the Trinity House, in Liverpool Street, in the\nOffice of Works, in the secret recesses of the British Museum; in a\nhundred inflammable warehouses, in five hundred shops, in a thousand\nprivate dwellings. And I timed them all for ignition at midnight of the\n23rd April.\n\nBy five in the afternoon of the 22nd, when I left my train in Maida\nVale, and drove alone to the solitary house on high ground near\nHampstead Heath which I had chosen, the work was well finished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great morning dawned, and I was early a-stir: for I had much to do\nthat day.\n\nI intended to make for the sea-shore the next morning, and had therefore\nto choose a good petrol motor, store it, and have it in a place of\nsafety; I had also to drag another vehicle after me, stored with trunks\nof time-fuses, books, clothes, and other little things.\n\nMy first journey was to Woolwich, whence I took all that I might ever\nrequire in the way of mechanism; thence to the National Gallery, where I\ncut from their frames the \'Vision of St. Helena,\' Murillo\'s \'Boy\nDrinking,\' and \'Christ at the Column\'; and thence to the Embassy to\nbathe, anoint myself, and dress.\n\nAs I had anticipated, and hoped, a blustering spring gale was blowing\nfrom the north.\n\nEven as I set out from Hampstead, about 9 A.M., I had been able to guess\nthat some of my fuses had somehow anticipated the appointed hour: for I\nsaw three red hazes at various points in the air, and heard the far\nvague booming of an occasional explosion; and by 11 A.M. I felt sure\nthat a large region of north-eastern London must be in flames. With the\nsolemn feelings of bridegrooms and marriage-mornings--with a flinching,\na flinching heart, God knows, yet a heart up-buoyed on thrilling joys--I\nwent about making preparations for the Gargantuan orgy of the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe house at Hampstead, which no doubt still stands, is of rather\npleasing design in quite a stone and rural style, with good breadths of\nwall-surface, two plain coped gables, mullioned windows, and oversailing\nslate verge roofs, but, rather spoiling it, a high square three-storied\ntower at the south-east angle, on the topmost floor of which I had slept\nthe previous night. There I had provided myself with a jar of pale\ntobacco mixed with rose-leaves and opium, found in a foreign house in\nSeymour Street, also a genuine Saloniki hookah, together with the best\nwines, nuts, and so on, and a gold harp of the musician Krasinski,\nstamped with his name, taken from his house in Portland Street.\n\nBut so much did I find to do that day, and so many odd things turned up\nwhich I thought that I would take with me, that it was not till near six\nthat I drove finally northward through Camden Town. And now an ineffable\nawe possessed my soul at the solemn noise which everywhere encompassed\nme, an ineffable awe, a blissful terror. Never, never could I have\ndreamed of aught so great and potent. All above my head there rushed\nsouthward with wide-spread wing of haste a sparkling smoke; and mixed\nwith the immense roaring I heard mysterious hubbubs of tumblings and\nrumblings, which I could not at all comprehend, like the moving-about of\nfurniture in the houses of Titans; while pervading all the air was a\nmost weird and tearful sound, as it were threnody, and a wild wail of\npain, and dying swan-songs, and all lamentations and tribulations of the\nworld. Yet I was aware that, at an hour so early, the flames must be far\nfrom general; in fact, they had not well commenced.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I had left a good semicircular region of houses, with a radius of\nfour hundred yards, without combustibles to the south of the isolated\nhouse which I was to occupy, and as the wind was so strongly from the\nnorth, I simply left my two vehicles at the door of the house, without\nfear of any injury: nor did any occur. I then went up to the top of the\ntower, lit the candles, and ate voraciously of the dinner which I had\nleft ready, for since the morning I had taken nothing; and then, with\nhands and heart that quivered, I arranged the clothes of the low\nspring-bed upon which to throw my frame in the morning hours. Opposite\nthe wall, where lay the bed, was a Gothic window, pretty large, with low\nsill, hung with poppy-figured muslin, and looking directly south, so\nthat I could recline at ease in the red-velvet easy-chair, and see. It\nhad evidently been a young lady\'s room: for on the toilette were\ncut-glass bottles, a plait of brown hair, powders, _rouge-aux-lÃ¨vres,_\none little bronze slipper, and knick-knacks, and I loved her and hated\nher, though I did not see her anywhere. About half-past eight I sat at\nthe window to watch, all being arranged and ready at my right hand, the\ncandles extinguished in the red room: for the theatre was opened, was\nopened: and the atmosphere of this earth seemed turned into Hell, and\nHell was in my soul.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon after midnight there was a sudden and very visible increase in the\nconflagration. On all hands I began to see blazing structures soar, with\ngrand hurrahs, on high. In fives and tens, in twenties and thirties, all\nbetween me and the remote limit of my vision, they leapt, they lingered\nlong, they fell. My spirit more and more felt, and danced--deeper\nmysteries of sensation, sweeter thrills. I sipped exquisitely, I drew\nout enjoyment leisurely. Anon, when some more expansive angel of flame\nwould arise from the Pit with steady aspiration, and linger with\noutspread arms, and burst, I would lift a little from the chair, leaning\nforward to clap, as at some famous acting; or I would call to them in\nshouts of cheer, giving them the names of Woman. For now I seemed to see\nnothing but some bellowing pandemonic universe through crimson glasses,\nand the air was wildly hot, and my eye-balls like theirs that walk\nstaring in the inner midst of burning fiery furnaces, and my skin itched\nwith a fierce and prickly itch. Anon I touched the chords of the harp to\nthe air of Wagner\'s \'WalkÃ¼ren-ritt.\'\n\nNear three in the morning, I reached the climax of my guilty sweets. My\ndrunken eye-lids closed in a luxury of pleasure, and my lips lay\nstretched in a smile that dribbled; a sensation of dear peace, of\nalmighty power, consoled me: for now the whole area which through\nstreaming tears I surveyed, mustering its ten thousand thunders, and\nbrawling beyond the stars the voice of its southward-rushing torment,\nbillowed to the horizon one grand Atlantic of smokeless and flushing\nflame; and in it sported and washed themselves all the fiends of Hell,\nwith laughter, shouts, wild flights, and holiday; and I--first of my\nrace--had flashed a signal to the nearer planets....\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose words: \'signal to the nearer planets\' I wrote nearly fourteen\nmonths ago, some days after the destruction of London, I being then on\nboard the old _Boreal_, making for the coast of France: for the night\nwas dark, though calm, and I was afraid of running into some ship, yet\nnot sleepy, so I wrote to occupy my fingers, the ship lying still. The\nbook in which I wrote has been near me: but no impulse to write anything\nhas visited me, till now I continue; not, however, that I have very much\nto put down.\n\nI had no intention of wearing out my life in lighting fires every\nmorning to warm myself in the inhospitable island of Britain, and set\nout to France with the view of seeking some palace in the Riviera,\nSpain, or perhaps Algiers, there, for the present at least, to make my\nhome.\n\nI started from Calais toward the end of April, taking my things along,\nthe first two days by train, and then determining that I was in no\nhurry, and a petrol motor easier, took one, and maintained a generally\nsouthern and somewhat eastern direction, ever-anew astonished at the\nwildness of the forest vegetation which, within so short a space since\nthe disappearance of man, chokes this pleasant land, even before the\ndefinite advent of summer.\n\nAfter three weeks of very slow travelling--for though I know several\ncountries very well, France with her pavered villages, hilly character,\nvines, forests, and primeval country-manner, is always new and charming\nto me--after three weeks I came unexpectedly to a valley which had never\nentered my head; and the moment that I saw it, I said: \'Here I will\nlive,\' though I had no idea what it was, for the monastery which I saw\ndid not look at all like a monastery, according to my ideas: but when I\nsearched the map, I discovered that it must be La Chartreuse de\nVauclaire in PÃ©rigord.\n\nIt is my belief that this word \'Vauclaire\' is nothing else than a\ncorruption of the Latin _Vallis Clara,_ or Bright Valley, for _l\'_s and\n_u\'_s did interchange about in this way, I remember: _cheval_ becoming\n_chevau(x)_ in the plural, like \'fool\' and \'fou,\' and the rest: which\nproves the dear laziness of French people, for the \'l\' was too much\ntrouble for them to sing, and when they came to _two_ \'l\'s\' they quite\nsuccumbed, shying that vault, or vo_u_te, and calling it some _y_. But\nat any rate, this Vauclaire, or Valclear, was well named: for here, if\nanywhere, is Paradise, and if anyone knew how and where to build and\nbrew liqueurs, it was those good old monks, who followed their Master\nwith _entrain_ in that Cana miracle, and in many other things, I fancy,\nbut aesthetically shirked to say to any mountain: \'Be thou removed.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general hue of the vale is a deep cerulean, resembling that blue of\nthe robes of Albertinelli\'s Madonnas; so, at least, it strikes the eye\non a clear forenoon of spring or summer. The monastery consists of an\noblong space, or garth, around three sides of which stand sixteen small\nhouses, with regular intervals between, all identical, the cells of the\nfathers; between the oblong space and the cells come the cloisters, with\nonly one opening to the exterior; in the western part of the oblong is\na little square of earth under a large cypress-shade, within which, as\nin a home of peace, it sleeps: and there, straight and slanting, stand\nlittle plain black crosses over graves....\n\nTo the west of the quadrangle is the church, with the hostelry, and an\nasphalted court with some trees and a fountain; and beyond, the\nentrance-gate.\n\nAll this stands on a hill of gentle slope, green as grass; and it is\nbacked close against a steep mountain-side, of which the tree-trunks are\nconjectural, for I never saw any, the trees resembling rather one\ncontinuous leafy tree-top, run out high and far over the extent of the\nmountain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was there four months, till something drove me away. I do not know\nwhat had become of the fathers and brothers, for I only found five, four\nof whom I took in two journeys in the motor beyond the church of Saint\nMartial d\'Artenset, and left them there; and the fifth remained three\nweeks with me, for I would not disturb him in his prayer. He was a\nbearded brother of forty years or thereabouts, who knelt in his cell\nrobed and hooded in all his phantom white: for in no way different from\nwhatever is most phantom, visionary and eerie must a procession of these\npeople have seemed by gloaming, or dark night This particular brother\nknelt, I say, in his small chaste room, glaring upward at his Christ,\nwho hung long-armed in a little recess between the side of three narrow\nbookshelves and a projection of the wall; and under the Christ a gilt\nand blue Madonna; the books on the three shelves few, leaning different\nways. His right elbow rested on a square plain table, at which was a\nwooden chair; behind him, in a corner, the bed: a bed all enclosed in\ndark boards, a broad perpendicular board along the foot, reaching the\nceiling, a horizontal board at the side over which he got into bed,\nanother narrower one like it at the ceiling for fringe and curtain, and\nanother perpendicular one hiding the pillow, making the clean bed within\na very shady and cosy little den, on the wall of this den being another\nsmaller Christ and a little picture. On the perpendicular board at the\nfoot hung two white garments, and over a second chair at the bed-side\nanother: all very neat and holy. He was a large stern man, blond as\ncorn, but with some red, too, in his hairy beard; and appalling was the\nsignificance of those eyes that prayed, and the long-drawn cavity of\nthose saffron cheeks. I cannot explain to myself my deep reverence for\nthis man; but I had it, certainly. Many of the others, it is clear, had\nfled: but not he: and to the near-marching cloud he opposed the Cross,\nholding one real as the other--he alone among many. For Christianity was\nan _Ã©lite_ religion, in which all were called, but few chosen, differing\nfrom Mohammedanism and Buddhism, which grasped and conquered all within\ntheir reach: the effect of Christ rather resembling Plato\'s and Dante\'s,\nit would seem: but Mahomet\'s more like Homer\'s and Shakespeare\'s.\n\nIt was my way to plant at the portal the big, carved chair from the\nchancel on the hot days, and rest my soul, refusing to think of\nanything, drowsing and smoking for hours. All down there in the plain\nwaved gardens of delicious fruit about the prolonged silver thread of\nthe river Isle, whose course winds loitering quite near the foot of the\nmonastery-slope. This slope dominates a tract of distance that is not\nonly vast, but looks immense, although the horizon is bounded by a\nsemicircle of low hills, rather too stiff and uniform for perfect\nbeauty; the interval of plain being occupied by yellow ploughed lands\nwhich were never sown, weedy now, and crossed and recrossed by\nvividly-green ribbons of vine, with stretches of pale-green lucerne,\norchards, and the white village of Monpont near the railway, all\nembowered, the Isle drawing its mercurial streams through the\nvillage-meadow, which is dark with shades of oaks: and to have played\nthere a boy, and used it familiarly from birth as one\'s own hand or\nfoot, must have been very sweet and homely; after this, the river\ndivides, and takes the shape of a heart; and very far away are visible\nthe grey banks of the Gironde. On the semicircle of hills, when there\nwas little distance-mist, I saw the ruins of some seigneurial chÃ¢teau,\nfor the seigneurs, too, knew where to build; and to my left, between a\nclump of oaks and an avenue of poplars, the bell-tower of the\nvillage--church of Saint Martial d\'Artenset--a very ancient type of\ntower, I believe, and common in France, rather ponderous, consisting of\na square mass with a smaller square mass stuck on, the latter having\nlarge Gothic windows; and behind me the west face of the\nmonastery-church, over the door being the statue of Saint Bruno.\n\nWell, one morning after four months, I opened my eyes in my cell to the\npiercing consciousness that I had burned Monpont over-night: and so\novercome was I with regret for this poor inoffensive little place, that\nfor two days, hardly eating, I paced between the oak and walnut pews of\nthe nave, massive stalls they are, separated by grooved Corinthian\npilasters, wondering what was to become of me, and if I was not already\nmad; and there are some little angels with extraordinarily human\nGreuze-like faces, supporting the nerves of the apse, which, after a\ntime, every time I passed them, seemed conscious of me and my existence\nthere; and the wood-work which ornaments the length of the nave, and of\nthe choir also, elaborate with carved marguerites and roses, here and\nthere took in my eyes significant forms from certain points of view; and\nthere is a partition--for the nave is divided into two chapels, one for\nthe brothers and one for the fathers, I conclude--and in this partition\na massive door, which yet looks quite light and graceful, carved with\noak and acanthus leaves, and every time I passed through I had the\nimpression that the door was a sentient thing, subconscious of me; and\nthe delicate Italian-Renaissance brick vault which springs from the vast\nnave seemed to look upon me with a gloomy knowledge of me, and of the\nheart within me; and at about four in the afternoon of the second day,\nafter pacing the church for hours, I fell down at one of the two altars\nnear that carved door of the screen, praying God to have mercy upon my\nsoul; and in the very midst of my praying, I was up and away, the devil\nin me, and I got into the motor, and did not come back to Vauclaire for\nanother month, and came leaving great tracts of burned desolation behind\nme, towns and forests, Bordeaux burned, Lebourne burned, Bergerac\nburned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to Vauclaire, for it seemed now my home; and there I\nexperienced a true, a deep repentance; and I humbled myself before my\nMaker. And while in this state, sitting one bright day in front of the\nmonastery-gate, something said to me: \'You will never be a good man, nor\npermanently escape Hell and Frenzy, unless you have an aim in life,\ndevoting yourself heart and soul to some great work, which will exact\nall your science, your thought, your ingenuity, your knowledge of modern\nthings, your strength of body and will, your skill of head and hand:\notherwise you are bound to succumb. Do this, therefore, beginning, not\nto-morrow nor this afternoon, but now: for though no man will see your\nwork, there is still the Almighty God, who is also something, in His\nway: and He will see how you strive, and try, and groan: and perhaps,\nseeing, He may have mercy upon you.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this way arose the idea of the Palace--an idea, indeed, which had\nentered my brain before, but merely as a bombastic and visionary outcome\nof my raving moods: now, however, in a very different way, soberly, and\nsoon concerning itself with details, difficulties, means, limitations,\nand every kind of practical matter-of-fact; and every obstruction which,\none by one, I foresaw was, one by one, as the days passed, over-borne by\nthe vigour with which that thought, rapidly becoming a mania, possessed\nme. After a week of incessant meditation, I decided Yes: and I said: I\nwill build a palace, which shall be both a palace and a temple: the\nfirst human temple worthy the King of Heaven, and the only human palace\nworthy the King of Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this decision I remained at Vauclaire another week, a very\ndifferent man to the lounger it had seen, strenuous, converted, humble,\nmaking plans of this and of that, of the detail, and of the whole,\ndrawing, multiplying, dividing, adding, conic sections and the\nrule-of-three, totting up the period of building, which came out at a\nlittle over twelve years, estimating the quantities of material, weight\nand bulk, my nights full of nightmare as to the _sort_, deciding as to\nthe size and structure of the crane, forge, and work-shop, and the\nnecessarily-limited weights of their component parts, making a list of\nover 2,400 objects, and finally, up to the third week after my departure\nfrom Vauclaire, skimming through the topography of nearly the whole\nearth, before fixing upon the island of Imbros for my site.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to England, and, once more, to the hollow windows and strewn\nstreets of black, burned-out and desolate London: for its bank-vaults,\netc., contained the necessary complement of the gold brought from Paris,\nand then lying in the _Speranza_ at Dover; nor had I sufficient\nfamiliarity with French industries and methods to find, even with the\naid of _Bottins_, one half of the 4,000 odd objects which I had now\ncatalogued. My ship was the _Speranza_, which brought me from Havre, for\nat Calais, to which I first went, I could find nothing suitable for all\npurposes, the _Speranza_ being an American yacht, very palatially\nfitted, three-masted, air-driven, with a carrying capacity of 2,000\ntons, Tobin-bronzed, in good condition, containing sixteen interacting\ntanks, with a five-block pulley-arrangement amid-ships that enables me\nto lift very considerable weights without the aid of the hoisting\nair-engine, high in the water, sharp, handsome, containing a few tons\nonly of sand-ballast, and needing when I found her only three days\' work\nat the water-line and engines to make her decent and fit. I threw out\nher dead, backed her from the Outer to the Inner Basin to my train on\nthe quai, took in the twenty-three hundred-weight bags of gold, and the\nhalf-ton of amber, and with this alone went to Dover, thence to\nCanterbury by motor, and thence in a long train, with a store of\ndynamite from the Castle for blasting possible obstructions, to London:\nmeaning to make Dover my _dÃ©pÃ´t_, and the London rails my thoroughfare\nfrom all parts of the country.\n\nInstead of three months, as I had calculated, it took me nine: a\nharrowing slavery. I had to blast no less than forty-three trains from\nthe path of my loaded wagons, several times blasting away the metals as\nwell, and then having to travel hundreds of yards without metals: for\nthe labour of kindling the obstructing engines, to shunt them down\nsidings perhaps distant, was a thing which I would not undertake.\nHowever, all\'s well that ends well, though if I had it to go through\nagain, certainly I should not. The _Speranza_ is now lying seven miles\noff Cape Roca, a heavy mist on the still water, this being the 19th of\nJune at 10 in the night: no wind, no moon: cabin full of mist: and I\npretty listless and disappointed, wondering in my heart why I was such\na fool as to take all that trouble, nine long servile months, my good\nGod, and now seriously thinking of throwing the whole vile thing to the\ndevil; she pretty deep in the water, pregnant with the palace. When the\nthirty-three ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose words: \'when the thirty-three\' were written by me over seventeen\nyears since--long years--seventeen in number, nor have I now any idea to\nwhat they refer. The book in which I wrote I had lost in the cabin of\nthe _Speranza_, and yesterday, returning to Imbros from an hour\'s\naimless cruise, discovered it there behind a chest.\n\nI find now considerable difficulty in guiding the pencil, and these few\nlines now written have quite an odd look, like the handwriting of a man\nnot very proficient in the art: it is seventeen years, seventeen,\nseventeen ... ah! And the expression of my ideas is not fluent either: I\nhave to think for the word a minute, and I should not be surprised if\nthe spelling of some of them is queer. My brain has been thinking\ninarticulately perhaps, all these years: and the English words and\nletters, as they now stand written, have rather an improbable and\nforeign air to me, as a Greek or Russian book might look to a man who\nhas not so long been learning those languages as to forget the\nimpossibly foreign impression received from them on the first day of\ntackling them. Or perhaps it is only my fancy: for that I have fancies I\nknow.\n\nBut what to write? The history of those seventeen years could not be put\ndown, my good God: at least, it would take me seventeen more to do it.\nIf I were to detail the building of the palace alone, and how it killed\nme nearly, and how I twice fled from it, and had to return, and became\nits bounden slave, and dreamed of it, and grovelled before it, and\nprayed, and raved, and rolled; and how I forgot to make provision on the\nwest side for the contraction and expansion of the gold in the colder\nweather and the heats of summer, and had to break down nine months\'\nwork, and how I cursed Thee, how I cursed Thee; and how the lake of wine\nevaporated faster than the conduits replenished it, and the three\njourneys which I had to take to Constantinople for shiploads of wine,\nand my frothing despairs, till I had the thought of placing the\nreservoir in the platform; and how I had then to break down the south\nside of the platform to the very bottom, and of the month-long nightmare\nof terror that I had lest the south side of the palace would undergo\nsubsidence; and how the petrol failed, and of the three-weeks\' search\nfor petrol along the coast; and how, after list-rubbing all the jet, I\nfound that I had forgotten the necessary rouge for polishing; and how,\nin the third year, I found the fluate, which I had for water-proofing\nthe pores of the platform-stone, nearly all leaked away in the\n_Speranza\'s_ hold, and I had to get silicate of soda at Gallipoli; and\nhow, after two years\' observation, I had to come to the conclusion that\nthe lake was leaking, and discovered that this Imbros sand was not\nsuitable for mixing with the skin of Portland cement which covered the\ncement concrete, and had to substitute sheet-bitumen in three places;\nand how I did all, all for the sake of God, thinking: \'I will work, and\nbe a good man, and cast Hell from me: and when I see it stand finished,\nit will be an Altar and a Testimony to me, and I shall find peace, and\nbe well\': and how I have been cheated--seventeen years, long years of my\nlife--for there is no God; and how my plasterers\'-hair failed me, and I\nhad to use flock, hessian, scrym, wadding, wood-street paving-blocks,\nand whatever I could find, for filling the interspaces between the\nplatform cross-walls; and of the espagnolette bolts, how a number of\nthem mysteriously disappeared, as if snatched to Hell by harpies, and I\nhad to make them; and how the crane-chain would not reach two of the\nsilver-panel castings when they were finished, and they were too heavy\nfor me to lift, and the wringing of the hands of my despair, and my\nbiting of the earth, and the transport of my fury; and how, for a whole\nwild week, I searched in vain for the text-book which describes the\nambering process; and how, when all was nearly over, in the blasting\naway of the forge and crane with dynamite, a long crack appeared down\nthe gold of the east platform-steps, and how I would not be consoled,\nbut mourned and mourned; and how, in spite of all my tribulations, it\nwas sweetly interesting to watch my power slowly grow from the first\nfeeble beginnings of the landing of materials and unloading them from\nthe motor, a hundred-weight at a time, till I could swing four tons--see\nthe solid metals flow--enjoy the gliding sounds of the handle,\ncrank-shaft, and system of levers, forcing inwards the mould-end, and\nthe upper and lower plungers, for pressing the material--build at ease\nin a travelling-cage--and watch from my hut-door through sleepless\nhours, under the electric moonlight of this land, the three piles of\ngold stones, the silver panels, the two-foot squares of jet, and be\ncomforted; and how the putty-wash--but it is past, it is past: and not\nto live over again that vulgar nightmare of means and ends have I taken\nto this writing again--but to put down something else, if I dare.\n\nSeventeen years, my good God, of that delusion! I could write down no\nsort of explanation for all those groans and griefs, at which a\nreasoning being would not shriek with laughter. I should have lived at\nease in some palace of the Middle-Orient, and burned my cities: but no,\nI must be \'a good man\'--vain thought. The words of a wild madman, that\npreaching man in England who prophesied what happened, were with me,\nwhere he says: \'the defeat of Man is _His_ defeat\'; and I said to\nmyself: \'Well, the last man shall not be quite a fiend, just to spite\nThat Other.\' And I worked and groaned, saying: \'I will be a good man,\nand burn nothing, nor utter aught unseemly, nor debauch myself, but\nchoke back the blasphemies that Those Others shriek through my throat,\nand build and build, with moils and groans.\' And it was Vanity: though I\ndo love the house, too, I love it well, for it is my home on the waste\nearth.\n\nI had calculated to finish it in twelve years, and I should undoubtedly\nhave finished it in fourteen, instead of in sixteen and seven months,\nbut one day, when the south, north, and east platform-steps were already\nfinished--it was in the July of the third year, and near sunset--as I\nleft off work, instead of going to the tent where my dinner lay ready, I\nwalked down to the ship--most strangely--in a daft, mechanical sort of\nway, without saying a word to myself, an evil-meaning smile of malice on\nmy lips; and at midnight I was lying off Mitylene, thirty miles to the\nsouth, having bid, as I thought, a last farewell to all those toils. I\nwas going to burn Athens.\n\nI did not, however: but kept on my way westward round Cape Matapan,\nintending to destroy the forests and towns of Sicily, if I found there a\nsuitable motor for travelling, for I had not been at the pains to take\nthe motor on board at Imbros; otherwise I would ravage parts of southern\nItaly. But when I came thereabouts, I was confronted with an awful\nhorror: for no southern Italy was there, and no Sicily was there, unless\na small new island, probably not five miles long, was Sicily; and\nnothing else I saw, save the still-smoking crater of Stromboli. I\ncruised northward, searching for land, and for a long time would not\nbelieve the evidence of the instruments, thinking that they wilfully\nmisled me, or I stark mad. But no: no Italy was there, till I came to\nthe latitude of Naples, it, too, having disappeared, engulfed, engulfed,\nall that stretch. From this monstrous thing I received so solemn a shock\nand mood of awe, that the evil mind in me was quite chilled and quelled:\nfor it was, and is, my belief that a wide-spread re-arrangement of the\nearth\'s surface is being purposed, and in all that drama, O my God, how\nshall _I_ be found?\n\nHowever, I went on my way, but more leisurely, not daring for a long\ntime to do anything, lest I might offend anyone; and, in this foolish\ncowering mind, coasted all the western coast of Spain and France during\nfive weeks, in that prolonged intensity of calm weather which now\nalternates with storms that transcend all thought, till I came again to\nCalais: and there, for the first time, landed.\n\nHere I would no longer contain myself, but burned; and that magnificent\nstretch of forest that lay between Agincourt and AbbÃ©ville, covering\nfive square miles, I burned; and AbbÃ©ville I burned; and Amiens I\nburned; and three forests between Amiens and Paris I burned; and Paris I\nburned; burning and burning during four months, leaving behind me\nsmoking districts, a long tract of ravage, like some being of the Pit\nthat blights where pass his flaming wings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis of city-burning has now become a habit with me more enchaining--and\ninfinitely more debased--than ever was opium to the smoker, or alcohol\nto the drunkard. I count it among the prime necessaries of my life: it\nis my brandy, my bacchanal, my secret sin. I have burned Calcutta,\nPekin, and San Francisco. In spite of the restraining influence of this\npalace, I have burned and burned. I have burned two hundred cities and\ncountrysides. Like Leviathan disporting himself in the sea, so I have\nrioted in this earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter an absence of six months, I returned to Imbros: for I was for\nlooking again upon the work which I had done, that I might mock myself\nfor all that unkingly grovelling: and when I saw it, standing there as I\nhad left it, frustrate and forlorn, and waiting its maker\'s hand, some\npity and instinct to build took me--for something of God was in Man--and\nI fell upon my knees, and spread my arms to God, and was converted,\npromising to finish the palace, with prayers that as I built so He\nwould build my soul, and save the last man from the enemy. And I set to\nwork that day to list-rub the last few dalles of the jet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not leave Imbros after that during four years, except for\noccasional brief trips to the coast--to Kilid-Bahr, Gallipoli, Lapsaki,\nGamos, Rodosto, Erdek, Erekli, or even once to Constantinople and\nScutari--if I happened to want anything, or if I was tired of work: but\nwithout once doing the least harm to anything, but containing my\nhumours, and fearing my Maker. And full of peaceful charm were those\nlittle cruises through this Levantic world, which, truly, is rather like\na light sketch in water-colours done by an angel than like the dun real\nearth; and full of self-satisfaction and pious contentment would I\nreturn to Imbros, approved of my conscience, for that I had surmounted\ntemptation, and lived tame and stainless.\n\nI had set up the southern of the two closed-lotus pillars, and the\nplatform-top was already looking as lovely as heaven, with its alternate\ntwo-foot squares of pellucid gold and pellucid jet, when I noticed one\nmorning that the _Speranza\'s_ bottom was really now too foul, and the\nwhim took me then and there to leave all, and clean her as far as I\ncould. I at once went on board, descended to the hold, took off my\nsudeyrie, and began to shift the ballast over to starboard, so as to\ntilt up her port bottom to the scraper. This was wearying labour, and\nabout noon I was sitting on a bag, resting in the almost darkness, when\nsomething seemed to whisper to me these words: \'_You dreamed last night\nthat there is an old Chinaman alive in Pekin._\' Horridly I started: I\n_had_ dreamed something of the sort, but, from the moment of waking,\ntill then, had forgotten it: and I leapt livid to my feet.\n\nI cleaned no _Speranza_ that day, nor for four days did I anything, but\nsat on the cabin-house and mused, my supporting palm among the hairy\ndraperies of my chin: for the thought of such a thing, if it could by\nany possibility be true, was detestable as death to me, changing the\ncolour of the sun, and the whole aspect of the world: and anon, at the\noutrage of that thing, my brow would flush with wrath, and my eyes\nblaze: till, on the fourth afternoon, I said to myself: \'That old\nChinaman in Pekin is likely to get burned to death, I think, or blown to\nthe clouds!\'\n\nSo, a second time, on the 4th March, the poor palace was left to build\nitself. For, after a short trip to Gallipoli, where I got some young\nlime-twigs in boxes of earth, and some preserved limes and ginger, I set\nout for a long voyage to the East, passing through the Suez Canal, and\nvisiting Bombay, where I was three weeks, and then destroyed it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had the thought of going across Hindustan by engine, but did not like\nto leave my ship, to which I was very attached, not sure of finding\nanything so suitable and good at Calcutta; and, moreover, I was afraid\nto abandon my petrol motor, which I had taken on board with the\nair-windlass, since I was going to uncivilised land. I therefore coasted\ndown western Hindustan.\n\nAll that northern shore of the Arabian Sea has at the present time an\nodour which it wafts far over the water, resembling odours of happy\nvague dream-lands, sweet to smell in the early mornings as if the earth\nwere nothing but a perfume, and life an inhalation.\n\nOn that voyage, however, I had, from beginning to end, twenty-seven\nfearful storms, or, if I count that one near the Carolines, then\ntwenty-eight. But I do not wish to write of these rages: they were too\ninhuman: and how I came alive through them against all my wildest hope,\nSomeone, or Something, only knows.\n\nI will write down here a thing: it is this, my God--something which I\nhave observed: a definite obstreperousness in the mood of the elements\nnow, when once roused, which grows, which grows continually. Tempests\nhave become very very far more wrathful, the sea more truculent and\nunbounded in its insolence; when it thunders, it thunders with a venom\nnew to me, cracking as though it would split the firmament, and bawling\nthrough the heaven of heavens, as if roaring to devour all things; in\nBombay once, and in China thrice, I was shaken by earthquakes, the\nsecond and third marked by a certain extravagance of agitation, that\nmight turn a man grey. Why should this be, my God? I remember reading\nvery long ago that on the American prairies, which from time immemorial\nhad been swept by great storms, the storms gradually subsided when man\nwent to reside permanently there. If this be true, it would seem that\nthe mere presence of man had a certain subduing or mesmerising effect\nupon the native turbulence of Nature, and his absence now may have\nremoved the curb. It is my belief that within fifty years from now the\nhuge forces of the earth will be let fully loose to tumble as they will;\nand this planet will become one of the undisputed playgrounds of Hell,\nand the theatre of commotions stupendous as those witnessed on the face\nof Saturn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earth is all on my brain, on my brain, O dark-minded Mother, with\nthy passionate cravings after the Infinite, thy regrets, and mighty\ngriefs, and comatose sleeps, and sinister coming doom, O Earth: and I,\npoor man, though a king, sole witness of thy bleak tremendous woes. Upon\nher I brood, and do not cease, but brood and brood--the habit, if I\nremember right, first becoming fixed and fated during that long voyage\neastward: for what is in store for her God only knows, and I have seen\nin my broodings long visions of her future, which, if a man should see\nwith the eye of flesh, he would spread the arms, and wheel and wheel\nthrough the mazes of a hiccuping giggling frenzy, for the vision only is\nthe very verge of madness. If I might cease but for one hour that\nperpetual brooding upon her! But I am her child, and my mind grows and\ngrows to her like the off-shoots of the banyan-tree, that take root\ndownward, and she sucks and draws it, as she draws my feet by\ngravitation, and I cannot take wing from her: for she is greater than I,\nand there is no escaping her; and at the last, I know, my soul will\ndash itself to ruin, like erring sea-fowl upon pharos-lights, against\nher wild and mighty bosom. Often a whole night through I lie open-eyed\nin the dark, with bursting brain, thinking of that hollow Gulf of\nMexico, how identical in shape and size with the protuberance of Africa\njust opposite, and how the protuberance of the Venezuelan and Brazilian\ncoast fits in with the in-curve of Africa: so that it is obvious to\nme--it is quite _obvious_--that they once were one; and one night rushed\nso far apart; and the wild Atlantic knew that thing, and ran gladly,\nhasting in between: and how if eye of flesh had been there to see, and\near to hear that cruel thundering, my God, my God--what horror! And if\nnow they meet again, so long apart ...but that way fury lies. Yet one\ncannot help but think: I lie awake and think, for she fills my soul, and\nabsorbs it, with all her moods and ways. She has meanings, secrets,\nplans. Strange, strange, for instance, that similarity between the\nscheme of Europe and the scheme of Asia: each with three southern\npeninsulas pointing south: Spain corresponding with Arabia, Italy with\nIndia, the Morea and Greece, divided by the Gulf of Corinth,\ncorresponding with the Malay Peninsula and Annam, divided by the Gulf of\nSiam; each with two northern peninsulas pointing south, Sweden and\nNorway, and Korea and Kamschatka; each with two great islands similarly\nplaced, Britain and Ireland, and the Japanese Hondo and Yezo; the Old\nWorld and the New has each a peninsula pointing north--Denmark and\nYucatan: a forefinger with long nail--and a thumb--pointing to the Pole.\nWhat does she mean? What can she mean, O Ye that made her? Is she\nherself a living being, with a will and a fate, as sailors said that\nships were living entities? And that thing that wheeled at the Pole,\nwheels it still yonder, yonder, in its dark ecstasy? Strange that\nvolcanoes are all near the sea: I don\'t know why; I don\'t think that\nanyone ever knew. This fact, in connection with submarine explosions,\nused to be cited in support of the chemical theory of volcanoes, which\nsupposed the infiltration of the sea into ravines containing the\nmaterials which form the fuel of eruptions: but God knows if that is\ntrue. The lofty ones are intermittent--a century, two, ten, of silent\nwaiting, and then their talk silenced for ever some poor district; the\nlow ones are constant in action. Who could know the dark way of the\nworld? Sometimes they form a linear system, consisting of several vents\nwhich extend in one direction, near together, like chimneys of some long\nfoundry beneath. In mountains, a series of serrated peaks denotes the\npresence of dolomites; rounded heads mean calcareous rocks; and needles,\ncrystalline schists. The preponderance of land in the northern\nhemisphere denotes the greater intensity there of the causes of\nelevation at a remote geologic epoch: that is all that one can say about\nit: but whence that greater intensity? I have some knowledge of the\nearth for only ten miles down: but she has eight thousand miles: and\nwhether through all that depth she is flame or fluid, hard or soft, I do\nnot know, I do not know. Her method of forming coal, geysers and hot\nsulphur-springs, and the jewels, and the atols and coral reefs; the\nmetamorphic rocks of sedimentary origin, like gneiss, the plutonic and\nvolcanic rocks, rocks of fusion, and the unstratified masses which\nconstitute the basis of the crust; and harvests, the burning flame of\nflowers, and the passage from the vegetable to the animal: I do not know\nthem, but they are of her, and they are like me, molten in the same\nfurnace of her fiery heart. She is dark and moody, sudden and ill-fated,\nand rends her young like a cannibal lioness; and she is old and wise,\nand remembers Hur of the Chaldees which Uruk built, and that Temple of\nBel which rose in seven pyramids to symbolise the planets, and\nBirs-i-Nimrud, and Haran, and she bears still, as a thing of yesterday,\nold Persepolis and the tomb of Cyrus, and those cloister-like\nvihÃ¢rah-temples of the ancient Buddhists, cut from the Himalayan rock;\nand returning from the Far East, I stopped at Ismailia, and so to Cairo,\nand saw where Memphis was, and stood one bright midnight before that\ngreat pyramid of Shafra, and that dumb Sphynx, and, seated at the well\nof one of the rock-tombs, looked till tears of pity streamed down my\ncheeks: for great is the earth, and her Ages, but man \'passeth away.\'\nThese tombs have pillars extremely like the two palace-pillars, only\nthat these are round, and mine are square: for I chose it so: but the\nsame band near the top, then over this the closed lotus-flower, then the\nsmall square plinth, which separates them from the architrave, only mine\nhave no architrave; the tombs consist of a little outer temple or court,\nthen comes a well, and inside another chamber, where, I suppose, the\ndead were, a ribbon-like astragal surrounding the walls, which are\ncrowned with boldly-projecting cornices, surmounted by an abacus. And\nhere, till the pressing want of food drove me back, I remained: for more\nand more the earth over-grows me, wooes me, assimilates me; so that I\nask myself this question: \'Must I not, in time, cease to be a man, and\nbecome a small earth, precisely her copy, extravagantly weird and\nfierce, half-demoniac, half-ferine, wholly mystic--morose and\nturbulent--fitful, and deranged, and sad--like her?\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA whole month of that voyage, from May the 15th to June the 13th, I\nwasted at the Andaman Islands near Malay: for that any old Chinaman\ncould be alive in Pekin began, after some time, to seem the most\nquixotic notion that ever entered a human brain; and these jungled\nislands, to which I came after a shocking vast orgy one night at\nCalcutta, when I fired not only the city but the river, pleased my fancy\nto such an extent, that at one time I intended to abide there. I was at\nthe one called in the chart \'Saddle Hill,\' the smallest of them, I\nthink: and seldom have I had such sensations of peace as I lay a whole\nburning day in a rising vale, deeply-shaded in palm and tropical\nranknesses, watching thence the _Speranza_ at anchor: for there was a\nlittle offing here at the shore whence the valley arose, and I could see\none of its long peaks lined with cocoanut-trees, and all cloud burned\nout of the sky except the flimsiest lawn-figments, and the sea as\nabsolutely calm as a lake roughened with breezes, yet making a\nconsiderable noise in its breaking on the shore, as I have noticed in\nthese sorts of places: I do not know why. These poor Andaman people seem\nto have been quite savage, for I met a number of them in roaming the\nisland, nearly skeletons, yet with limbs and vertebrae still, in\ngeneral, cohering, and in some cases dry-skinned and mummified relics of\nflesh, and never anywhere a sign of clothes: a very singular thing,\nconsidering their nearness to high old civilisations all about them.\nThey looked small and black, or almost; and I never found a man without\nfinding on or near him a spear and other weapons: so that they were\neager folk, and the wayward dark earth was in them, too, as she should\nbe in her children. They had in many cases some reddish discoloration,\nwhich may have been the traces of betel-nut stains: for betel-nuts\nabound there. And I was so pleased with these people, that I took on\nboard with the gig one of their little tree-canoes: which was my\nfoolishness: for gig and canoe were only three nights later washed from\nthe decks into the middle of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI passed down the Straits of Malacca, and in that short distance between\nthe Andaman Islands, and the S.W. corner of Borneo I was thrice so\nmauled, that at times it seemed quite out of the question that anything\nbuilt by man could escape such unfettered cataclysms, and I resigned\nmyself, but with bitter reproaches, to perish darkly. The effect of the\nthird upon me, when it was over, was the unloosening afresh of all my\nevil passion: for I said: \'Since they mean to slay me, death shall find\nme rebellious\'; and for weeks I could not sight some specially happy\nvillage, or umbrageous spread of woodland, that I did not stop the ship,\nand land the materials for their destruction; so that nearly all those\nspicy lands about the north of Australia will bear the traces of my hand\nfor many a year: for more and more my voyage became dawdling and\nzigzaged, as the merest whim directed it, or the movement of the pointer\non the chart; and I thought of eating the lotus of surcease and nepenthe\nin some enchanted nook of this bowering summer, where from my hut-door I\ncould see through the pearl-hues of opium the sea-lagoon slaver lazily\nupon the old coral atol, and the cocoanut-tree would droop like slumber,\nand the bread-fruit tree would moan in sweet and weary dream, and I\nshould watch the _Speranza_ lie anchored in the pale atol-lake, year\nafter year, and wonder what she was, and whence, and why she dozed so\ndeep for ever, and after an age of melancholy peace and burdened bliss,\nI should note that sun and moon had ceased revolving, and hung inert,\nopening anon a heavy lid to doze and drowse again, and God would sigh\n\'Enough,\' and nod, and Being would swoon to sleep: for that any old\nChinaman should be alive in Pekin was a thing so fantastically maniac,\nas to draw from me at times sudden fits of wild red laughter that left\nme faint.\n\nDuring a space of four months, from the 18th June to the 23rd October, I\nvisited the Fijis, where I saw skulls still surrounded with remnants of\nextraordinary haloes of stiff hair, women clad in girdles made of thongs\nfixed in a belt, and, in Samoa near, bodies crowned with coronets of\nnautilus-shell, and traces of turmeric-paint and tattooing, and in one\ntownlet a great assemblage of carcasses, suggesting by their look some\nfestival, or dance: so that I believe that these people were overthrown\nwithout the least fore-knowledge of anything. The women of the Maoris\nwore an abundance of green-jade ornaments, and I found a peculiar kind\nof shell-trumpet, one of which I have now, also a tattooing chisel, and\na nicely-carved wooden bowl. The people of New Caledonia, on the other\nhand, went, I should think, naked, confining their attention to the\nhair, and in this resembling the Fijians, for they seemed to wear an\nartificial hair made of the fur of some creature like a bat, and also\nthey wore wooden masks, and great rings--for the ear, no doubt--which\nmust have fallen to the shoulders: for the earth was in them all, and\nmade them wild, perverse and various like herself. I went from one to\nthe other without any system whatever, searching for the ideal\nresting-place, and often thinking that I had found it: but only wearying\nof it at the thought that there was a yet deeper and dreamier in the\nworld. But in this search I received a check, my God, which chilled me\nto the marrow, and set me flying from these places.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne evening, the 29th November, I dined rather late--at eight--sitting,\nas was my custom in calm weather, cross-legged on the cabin-rug at the\nport aft corner, a small semicircle of _Speranza_ gold-plate before me,\nand near above me the red-shaded lamp with green conical reservoir,\nwhose creakings never cease in the stillest mid-sea, and beyond the\nplates the array of preserved soups, meat-extracts, meats, fruit,\nsweets, wines, nuts, liqueurs, coffee on the silver spirit-tripod,\nglasses, cruet, and so on, which it was always my first care to select\nfrom the store-room, open, and lay out once for all in the morning on\nrising. I was late, seven being my hour: for on that day I had been\nengaged in the occasionally necessary, but always deferred, task of\noverhauling the ship, brushing here a rope with tar, there a board with\npaint, there a crank with oil, rubbing a door-handle, a brass-fitting,\nfilling the three cabin-lamps, dusting mirrors and furniture, dashing\nthe great neat-joinered plains of deck with bucketfulls, or, high in\nair, chopping loose with its rigging the mizzen top-mast, which since a\nmonth was sprained at the clamps, all this in cotton drawers under loose\n_quamis_, bare-footed, my beard knotted up, the sun a-blaze, the sea\nsmooth and pale with the smooth pallor of strong currents, the ship\nstill enough, no land in sight, yet great tracts of sea-weed making\neastward--I working from 11 A.M. till near 7, when sudden darkness\ninterrupted: for I wished to have it all over in one obnoxious day. I\nwas therefore very tired when I went down, lit the central chain-lever\nlamp and my own two, washed and dressed in my bedroom, and sat to dinner\nin the dining-hall corner. I ate voraciously, with sweat, as usual,\npouring down my eager brow, using knife or spoon in the right hand, but\nnever the Western fork, licking the plates clean in the Mohammedan\nmanner, and drinking pretty freely. Still I was tired, and went upon\ndeck, where I had the threadbare blue-velvet easy-chair with the broken\nleft arm before the wheel, and in it sat smoking cigar after cigar from\nthe Indian D box, half-asleep, yet conscious. The moon came up into a\npretty cloudless sky, and she was bright, but not bright enough to\nout-shine the enlightened flight of the ocean, which that night was one\ncontinuous swamp of Jack-o\'-lantern phosphorescence, a wild but faint\nluminosity mingled with stars and flashes of brilliance, the whole\ntrooping unanimously eastward, as if in haste with elfin momentous\npurpose, a boundless congregation, in the sweep of a strong oceanic\ncurrent. I could hear it, in my slumbrous lassitude, struggling and\ngurgling at the tied rudder, and making wet sloppy noises under the\nsheer of the poop; and I was aware that the _Speranza_ was gliding along\npretty fast, drawn into that procession, probably at the rate of four to\nsix knots: but I did not care, knowing very well that no land was within\ntwo hundred miles of my bows, for I was in longitude 173Â°, in the\nlatitude of Fiji and the Society Islands, between those two: and after a\ntime the cigar drooped and dropped from my mouth, and sleep overcame\nme, and I slept there, in the lap of the Infinite.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo that something preserves me, Something, Someone: _and for what?_ ...\nIf I had slept in the cabin, I must most certainly have perished: for\nlying there on the poop, I dreamed a dream which once I had dreamed on\nthe ice, far, far yonder in the forgotten hyperborean North: that I was\nin an Arabian paradise, a Garden of Peaches; and I had a very long\nvision of it, for I walked among the trees, and picked the fruit, and\npressed the blossoms to my nostrils with breathless inhalations of love:\ntill a horrible sickness woke me: and when I opened my eyes, the night\nwas black, the moon gone down, everything wet with dew, the sky arrayed\nwith most glorious stars like a thronged bazaar of tiaraed rajahs and\nbegums with spangled trains, and all the air fragrant with that mortal\nscent; and high and wide uplifted before me--stretching from the\nnorthern to the southern limit--a row of eight or nine inflamed smokes,\nas from the chimneys of some Cyclopean foundry a-work all night, most\nsolemn, most great and dreadful in the solemn night: eight or nine, I\nshould say, or it might be seven, or it might be ten, for I did not\ncount them; and from those craters puffed up gusts of encrimsoned\nmaterial, here a gust and there a gust, with tinselled fumes that\nconvolved upon themselves, and sparks and flashes, all veiled in a\ngarish haze of light: for the foundry worked, though languidly; and upon\na rocky land four miles ahead, which no chart had ever marked, the\n_Speranza_ drove straight with the current of the phosphorus sea.\n\nAs I rose, I fell flat: and what I did thereafter I did in a state of\nexistence whose acts, to the waking mind, appear unreal as dream. I must\nat once, I think, have been conscious that here was the cause of the\ndestruction of mankind; that it still surrounded its own neighbourhood\nwith poisonous fumes; and that I was approaching it. I must have somehow\ncrawled, or dragged myself forward. There is an impression on my mind\nthat it was a purple land of pure porphyry; there is some faint memory,\nor dream, of hearing a long-drawn booming of waves upon its crags: I do\nnot know whence I have them. I think that I remember retching with\ndesperate jerks of the travailing intestines; also that I was on my face\nas I moved the regulator in the engine-room: but any recollection of\ngoing down the stairs, or of coming up again, I have not. Happily, the\nwheel was tied, the rudder hard to port, and as the ship moved, she\nmust, therefore, have turned; and I must have been back to untie the\nwheel in good time, for when my senses came, I was lying there, my head\nagainst the under gimbal, one foot on a spoke of the wheel, no land in\nsight, and morning breaking.\n\nThis made me so sick, that for either two or three days I lay without\neating in the chair near the wheel, only rarely waking to sufficient\nsense to see to it that she was making westward from that place; and on\nthe morning when I finally roused myself I did not know whether it was\nthe second or the third morning: so that my calendar, so scrupulously\nkept, may be a day out, for to this day I have never been at the pains\nto ascertain whether I am here writing now on the 5th or the 6th of\nJune.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, on the fourth, or the fifth, evening after this, just as the sun\nwas sinking beyond the rim of the sea, I happened to look where he hung\nmotionless on the starboard bow: and there I saw a clean-cut black-green\nspot against his red--a most unusual sight here and now--a ship: a poor\nthing, as it turned out when I got near her, without any sign of mast,\nheavily water-logged, some relics of old rigging hanging over, even her\nbowsprit apparently broken in the middle (though I could not see it),\nand she nothing more than a hirsute green mass of old weeds and\nsea-things from bowsprit-tip to poop, and from bulwarks to water-line,\nstout as a hedgehog, only awaiting there the next high sea to founder.\n\nIt being near my dinner-hour and night\'s rest, I stopped the _Speranza_\nsome fifteen yards from her, and commenced to pace my spacious poop, as\nusual, before eating; and as I paced, I would glance at her, wondering\nat her destiny, and who were the human men that had lived on her, their\nChristian names, and family names, their age, and thought, and way of\nlife, and beards; till the desire arose within me to go to her, and see;\nand I threw off my outer garments, uncovered and unroped the cedar\ncutter--the only boat, except the air-pinnace, left to me intact--and\ngot her down by the mizzen five-block pulley-system. But it was a\nridiculous nonsense, for having paddled to her, I was thrown into\nparoxysms of rage by repeated failures to scale her bulwarks, low as\nthey were; my hands, indeed, could reach, but I found no hold upon the\nslimy mass, and three rope-ends which I caught were also untenably\nslippery: so that I jerked always back into the boat, my clothes a mass\nof filth, and the only thought in my blazing brain a twenty-pound\ncharge of guncotton, of which I had plenty, to blow her to uttermost\nHell. I had to return to the _Speranza_, get a half-inch rope, then back\nto the other, for I would not be baulked in such a way, though now the\ndark was come, only slightly tempered by a half-moon, and I getting\nhungry, and from minute to minute more fiendishly ferocious. Finally, by\ndint of throwing, I got the rope-loop round a mast-stump, drew myself\nup, and made fast the boat, my left hand cut by some cursed shell: and\nall for what? the imperiousness of a whim. The faint moonlight shewed an\nample tract of deck, invisible in most parts under rolled beds of putrid\nseaweed, and no bodies, and nothing but a concave, large esplanade of\nseaweed. She was a ship of probably 1,500 tons, three-masted, and a\nsailer. I got aft (for I had on thick outer babooshes), and saw that\nonly four of the companion-steps remained; by a small leap, however, I\ncould descend into that desolation, where the stale sea-stench seemed\nconcentrated into a very essence of rankness. Here I experienced a\nsingular ghostly awe and timorousness, lest she should sink with me, or\nsomething: but striking matches, I saw an ordinary cabin, with some\nfungoids, skulls, bones and rags, but not one cohering skeleton. In the\nsecond starboard berth was a small table, and on the floor a thick\nround ink-pot, whose continual rolling on its side made me look down;\nand there I saw a flat square book with black covers, which curved\nhalf-open of itself, for it had been wet and stained. This I took, and\nwent back to the _Speranza_: for that ship was nothing but an emptiness,\nand a stench of the crude elements of life, nearly assimilated now to\nthe rank deep to which she was wedded, and soon to be absorbed into its\nnature and being, to become a sea in little, as I, in time, my God,\nshall be nothing but an earth in little.\n\nDuring dinner, and after, I read the book, with some difficulty, for it\nwas pen-written in French, and discoloured, and it turned out to be the\njournal of someone, a passenger and voyager, I imagine, who called\nhimself Albert Tissu, and the ship the _Marie Meyer_. There was nothing\nremarkable in the narrative that I could see--common-place descriptions\nof South Sea scenes, records of weather, cargoes, and the like--till I\ncame to the last written page: and that was remarkable enough. It was\ndated the 13th of April--strange thing, my good God, incredibly\nstrange--that same day, twenty long years ago, when I reached the Pole;\nand the writing on that page was quite different from the neat look of\nthe rest, proving immoderate excitement, wildest haste; and he heads it\n\'_Cinq Heures_,\'--I suppose in the evening, for he does not say: and he\nwrites: \'Monstrous event! phenomenon without likeness! the witnesses of\nwhich must for ever live immortalised in the annals of the universe, an\nevent which will make even Mama, Henri and Juliette admit that I was\njustified in undertaking this most eventful voyage. Talking with Captain\nTombarel on the poop, when a sudden exclamation from him--""_Mon Dieu!_""\nHis visage whitens! I follow the direction of his gaze to eastward! I\nbehold! eight kilomÃ¨tres perhaps away--, _ten monstrous waterspouts_,\nreaching up, up, high enough--all apparently in one straight line, with\nintervals of nine hundred _mÃ¨tres_, very regularly placed. They do not\nwander, dance, nor waver, as waterspouts do; nor are they at all\nlily-shaped, like waterspouts: but ten hewn pillars of water, with\nuniform diameter from top to bottom, only a little twisted here and\nthere, and, as I divine, fifty _mÃ¨tres_ in girth. Five, ten, stupendous\nminutes we look, Captain Tombarel mechanically repeating and repeating\nunder his breath ""_Mon Dieu!_"" ""_Mon Dieu!_"" the whole crew now on the\npoop, I agitated, but collected, watch in hand. And suddenly, all is\nblotted out: the pillars of water, doubtless still there, can no more be\nseen: for the ocean all about them is steaming, hissing higher than the\npillars a dense white vapour, vast in extent, whose venomous sibilation\nwe at this distance can quite distinctly hear. It is affrighting, it is\nintolerable! the eyes can hardly bear to watch, the ears to hear! it\nseems unholy travail, monstrous birth! But it lasts not long: all at\nonce the _Marie Meyer_ commences to pitch and roll violently, and the\nsea, a moment since calm, is now rough! and at the same time, through\nthe white vapour, we see a dark shadow slowly rising--the shadow of a\nmighty back, a new-born land, bearing upwards ten flames of fire,\nslowly, steadily, out of the sea, into the clouds. At the moment when\nthat sublime emergence ceases, or seems to cease, the grand thought that\nsmites me is this: ""I, Albert Tissu, am immortalised: my name shall\nnever perish from among men!"" I rush down, I write it. The latitude is\n16Â° 21\' 13"" South; the longitude 176Â° 58\' 19"" West[1]. There is a great\ndeal of running about on the decks--they are descending. There is surely\na strange odour of almonds--I only hope--it is so dark, _mon D_----\'\n\nSo the Frenchman, Tissu.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This must be French reckoning, from meridian of Paris.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith all that region I would have no more to do: for all here, it used\nto be said, lies a great sunken continent; and I thought it would be\nrising and shewing itself to my eyes, and driving me stark mad: for the\nearth is full of these contortions, sudden monstrous grimaces and\napparitions, which are like the face of Medusa, affrighting a man into\nspinning stone; and nothing could be more appallingly insecure than\nliving on a planet.\n\nI did not stop till I had got so far northward as the Philippine\nIslands, where I was two weeks--exuberant, odorous places, but so hilly\nand rude, that at one place I abandoned all attempt at travelling in the\nmotor, and left it in a valley by a broad, shallow, noisy river, full of\nmossy stones: for I said: \'Here I will live, and be at peace\'; and then\nI had a fright, for during three days I could not re-discover the river\nand the motor, and I was in the greatest despair, thinking: \'When shall\nI find my way out of these jungles and vastnesses?\' For I was where no\npaths were, and had lost myself in deeps where the lure of the earth is\ntoo strong and rank for a single man, since in such places, I suppose, a\nman would rapidly be transformed into a tree, or a snake, or a tiger. At\nlast, however, I found the place, to my great joy, but I would not shew\nthat I was glad, and to hide it, fell upon a front wheel of the car with\nsome kicks. I could not make out who the people were that lived here:\nfor the relics of some seemed quite black, like New Zealand races, and I\ncould still detect the traces of tattooing, while others suggested\nMongolian types, and some looked like pigmies, and some like whites. But\nI cannot detail the two-years\' incidents of that voyage: for it is past,\nand like a dream: and not to write of that--of all that--have I taken\nthis pencil in hand after seventeen long, long years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSingular my reluctance to put it on paper. I will write rather of the\nvoyage to China, and how I landed the motor on the wharf at Tientsin,\nand went up the river through a maize and rice-land most charming in\nspite of intense cold, I thick with clothes as an Arctic traveller; and\nof the three dreadful earthquakes within two weeks; and how the only map\nwhich I had of the city gave no indication of the whereabouts of its\nmilitary depositories, and I had to seek for them; and of the three\ndays\' effort to enter them, for every gate was solid and closed; and how\nI burned it, but had to observe its flames, without deep pleasure, from\nbeyond the walls to the south, the whole place being one cursed plain;\nyet how, at one moment, I cried aloud with wild banterings and glad\nlaughters of Tophet to that old Chinaman still alive within it; and how\nI coasted, and saw the hairy Ainus, man and woman hairy alike; and how,\nlying one midnight awake in my cabin, the _Speranza_ being in a still\nglassy water under a cliff overhung by drooping trees--it was the\nharbour of Chemulpo--to me lying awake came the thought: \'Suppose now\nyou should hear a step walking to and fro, leisurely, on the poop above\nyou--_just suppose\'_; and the night of horrors which I had, for I could\nnot help supposing, and at one time really thought that I heard it: and\nhow the sweat rolled and poured from my brow; and how I went to\nNagasaki, and burned it; and how I crossed over the great Pacific deep\nto San Francisco, for I knew that Chinamen had been there, too, and one\nof them might be alive; and how, one calm day, the 15th or the 16th\nApril, I, sitting by the wheel in the mid-Pacific, suddenly saw a great\nwhite hole that ran and wheeled, and wheeled and ran, in the sea, coming\ntoward me, and I was aware of the hot breath of a reeling wind, and then\nof the hot wind itself, which deep-groaned the sound of the letter _V_,\nhumming like a billion spinning-tops, and the _Speranza_ was on her\nside, sea pouring over her port-bulwarks, and myself in the corner\nbetween deck and taffrail, drowning fast, but unable to stir; but all\nwas soon past and the white hole in the sea, and the hot spinning-top of\nwind, ran wheeling beyond, to the southern horizon, and the _Speranza_\nrighted herself: so that it was clear that someone wished to destroy me,\nfor that a typhoon of such vehemence ever blew before I cannot think;\nand how I came to San Francisco, and how I burned it, and had my sweets:\nfor it was mine; and how I thought to pass over the great\ntrans-continental railway to New York, but would not, fearing to leave\nthe _Speranza_, lest all the ships in the harbour there should be\nwrecked, or rusted, and buried under sea-weed, and turned unto the sea;\nand how I went back, my mind all given up now to musings upon the earth\nand her ways, and a thought in my soul that I would return to those deep\nplaces of the Filipinas, and become an autochthone--a tree, or a snake,\nor a man with snake-limbs, like the old autochthones: but I would not:\nfor Heaven was in man, too: Earth and Heaven; and how as I steamed round\nwest again, another winter come, and I now in a mood of dismal\ndespondencies, on the very brink of the inane abyss and smiling idiotcy,\nI saw in the island of Java the great temple of Boro Budor: and like a\ntornado, or volcanic event, my soul was changed: for my recent studies\nin the architecture of the human race recurred to me with interest, and\nthree nights I slept in the temple, examining it by day. It is vast,\nwith that look of solid massiveness which above all characterises the\nJapanese and Chinese building, my measurement of its width being 529\nfeet, and it rises terrace-like in six stories to a height of about 120\nor 130 feet: here Buddhist and Brahmin forms are combined into a most\nrichly-developed whole, with a voluptuousness of tracery that is simply\nintoxicating, each of the five off-sets being divided up into an\ninnumerable series of external niches, containing each a statue of the\nsitting Boodh, all surmounted by a number of cupolas, and the whole\ncrowned by a magnificent dagop: and when I saw this, I had the impulse\nto return to my home after so long wandering, and to finish the temple\nof temples, and the palace of palaces; and I said: \'I will return, and\nbuild it as a testimony to God.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSave for a time, near Cairo, I did not once stop on that homeward\nvoyage, but turned into the little harbour at Imbros at a tranquil\nsunset on the 7th of March (as I reckon), and I moored the _Speranza_ to\nthe ring in the little quay, and I raised the battered motor from the\nhold with the middle air-engine (battered by the typhoon in the\nmid-Pacific, which had broken it from the rope-fastenings and tumbled it\nhead-over-heels to port), and I went through the windowless\nvillage-street, and up through the plantains and cypresses which I knew,\nand the Nile mimosas, and mulberries, and Trebizond palms, and pines,\nand acacias, and fig-trees, till the thicket stopped me, and I had to\nalight: for in those two years the path had finally disappeared; and on,\non foot, I made my way, till I came to the board-bridge, and leant\nthere, and looked at the rill; and thence climbed the steep path in the\nsward toward that rolling table-land where I had built with many a\ngroan; and half-way up, I saw the tip of the crane-arm, then the blazing\ntop of the south pillar, then the shed-roof, then the platform, a\nblinking blotch of glory to the watery eyes under the setting sun. But\nthe tent, and nearly all that it contained, was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor four days I would do nothing, simply lying and watching, shirking a\nload so huge: but on the fifth morning I languidly began something: and\nI had not worked an hour, when a fever took me--to finish it, to finish\nit--and it lasted upon me, with only three brief intervals, nearly seven\nyears; nor would the end have been so long in coming, but for the\nunexpected difficulty of getting the four flat roofs water-tight, for I\nhad to take down half the east one. Finally, I made them of gold slabs\none-and-a-quarter inch thick, smooth on both sides, on each beam double\ngutters being fixed along each side of the top flange to catch any\nleakage at the joints, which are filled with slaters\'-cement. The slabs\nare clamped to the top flanges by steel clips, having bolts set with\nplaster-of-Paris in holes drilled in the slabs. These clips are 1-1/2\nin. by 3/17 in., and are 17 in. apart. The roofs are slightly pitched to\nthe front edges, where they drain into gold-plated copper-gutters on\nplated wrought-iron brackets, with one side flashed up over the blocks,\nwhich raise the slabs from the beam-tops, to clear the joint gutters....\nBut now I babble again of that base servitude, which I would forget, but\ncannot: for every measurement, bolt, ring, is in my brain, like a\nburden: but it is past, it is past--and it was vanity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix months ago to-day it was finished: six months more protracted,\ndesolate, burdened, than all those sixteen years in which I built.\n\nI wonder what a man--another man--some Shah, or Tsar, of that far-off\npast, would say now of me, if eye could rest upon me! With what awe\nwould he certainly shrink before the wild majesty of these eyes; and\nthough I am not lunatic--for I am not, I am not--how would he fly me\nwith the exclamation: \'There is the very lunacy of Pride!\'\n\nFor there would seem to him--it must be so--in myself, in all about me,\nsomething extravagantly royal, touched with terror. My body has\nfattened, and my girth now fills out to a portly roundness its broad\nBabylonish girdle of crimson cloth, minutely gold-embroidered, and hung\nwith silver, copper and gold coins of the Orient; my beard, still black,\nsweeps in two divergent sheaves to my hips, flustered by every wind; as\nI walk through this palace, the amber-and-silver floor reflects in its\ndepths my low-necked, short-armed robe of purple, blue, and scarlet,\na-glow with luminous stones. I am ten times crowned Lord and Emperor; I\nsit a hundred times enthroned in confirmed, obese old Majesty. Challenge\nme who will--challenge me who dare! Among those myriad worlds upon which\nI nightly pore, I may have my Peers and Compeers and Fellow-denizens ...\nbut _here_ I am Sole; Earth acknowledges my ancient sway and hereditary\nsceptre: for though she draws me, not yet, not yet, am I hers, but she\nis mine. It seems to me not less than a million million aeons since\nother beings, more or less resembling me, walked impudently in the open\nsunlight on this planet, which is rightly mine--I can indeed no longer\npicture to myself, nor even credit, that such a state of things--so\nfantastic, so far-fetched, so infinitely droll--could have existed:\nthough, at bottom, I suppose, I know that it must have been really so.\nUp to ten years ago, in fact, I used frequently to dream that there were\nothers. I would see them walk in the streets like ghosts, and be\ntroubled, and start awake: but never now could such a thing, I think,\noccur to me in sleep: for the wildness of the circumstance would\ncertainly strike my consciousness, and immediately I should know that\nthe dream was a dream. For now, at least, I am sole, I am lord. The\ngolden walls of this palace which I have built look down, enamoured of\ntheir reflection, into a lake of the choicest, purplest wine.\n\nNot that I made it of wine because wine is rare; nor the walls of gold\nbecause gold is rare: that would have been too childish: but because I\nwould match for beauty a human work with the works of those Others: and\nbecause it happens, by some persistent freak of the earth, that\nprecisely things most rare and costly are generally the most beautiful.\n\nThe vision of glorious loveliness which is this palace now risen before\nmy eyes cannot be described by pen and paper, though there _may_ be\nwords in the lexicons of language which, if I sought for them with\ninspired wit for sixteen years, as I have built for sixteen years, might\nas vividly express my thought on paper, as the stones-of-gold, so\ngrouped and built, express it to the eye: but, failing such labours and\nskill, I suppose I could not give, if there were another man, and I\ntried to give, the faintest conception of its celestial charm.\n\nIt is a structure positively as clear as the sun, and as fair as the\nmoon--the sole great human work in the making of which no restraining\nthought of cost has played a part: one of its steps alone being of more\ncost than all the temples, mosques and besestins, the palaces, pagodas\nand cathedrals, built between the ages of the Nimrods and the Napoleons.\n\nThe house itself is very small--only 40 ft. long, by 35 broad, by 27\nhigh: yet the structure as a whole is sufficiently enormous, high\nuplifted: the rest of the bulk being occupied by the platform, on which\nthe house stands, each side of this measuring at its base 480 ft., its\nheight from top to bottom 130 ft, and its top 48 ft. square, the\nelevation of the steps being just nearly 30 degrees, and the top reached\nfrom each of the four points of the compass by 183 low long steps, very\nmassively overlaid with smooth molten gold--not forming a continuous\nflight, but broken into threes and fives, sixes and nines, with landings\nbetween the series, these from the top looking like a great terraced\nparterre of gold. It is thus an Assyrian palace in scheme: only that the\nplatform has steps on all sides, instead of on one. The platform-top,\nfrom its edge to the golden walls of the house, is a mosaic consisting\nof squares of the glassiest clarified gold, and squares of the glassiest\njet, corner to corner, each square 2 ft. wide. Around the edge of the\nplatform on top run 48 square plain gold pilasters, 12 on each side, 2\nft. high, tapering upwards, and topped by a knob of solid gold, pierced\nwith a hole through which passes a lax inch-and-a-half silver chain,\nhung with little silver balls which strike together in the breeze. The\nmansion consists of an outer court, facing east toward the sea, and the\nhouse proper, which encloses an inner court. The outer court is a hollow\noblong 32 ft. wide by 8 ft. long, the summit of its three walls being\nbattlemented; they are 18-1/2 ft. in height, or 8-1/2 ft. lower than the\nhouse; around their gold sides, on inside and outside, 3 ft. from the\ntop, runs a plain flat band of silver, 1 ft. wide, projecting 2/3 in.,\nand at the gate, which is a plain Egyptian entrance, facing eastwards,\n2-1/2 ft. narrower at top than at bottom, stand the two great square\npillars of massive plain gold, tapering upwards, 45 ft. high, with their\ncapital of band, closed lotus, and thin plinth; in the outer court,\nimmediately opposite the gate, is an oblong well, 12 ft. by 3 ft,\nreproducing in little the shape of the court, its sides, which are\ngold-lined, tapering downward to near the bottom of the platform, where\na conduit of 1/8 in. diameter automatically replenishes the ascertained\nmean evaporation of the lake during the year, the well containing\n105,360 litres when nearly full, and the lake occupying a circle round\nthe platform of 980 ft. diameter, with a depth of 3-1/2 ft. Round the\nwell run pilasters connected by silver chains with little balls, and it\ncommunicates by a 1/8 in. conduit with a pool of wine let into the inner\ncourt, this being fed from eight tall and narrow golden tanks, tapering\nupwards, which surround it, each containing a different red wine,\nsufficient on the whole to last for all purposes during my lifetime. The\nground of the outer court is also a mosaic of jet and gold: but\nthenceforth the jet-squares give place throughout to squares of silver,\nand the gold-squares to squares of clear amber, clear as solidified oil.\nThe entrance is by an Egyptian doorway 7 ft. high, with folding-doors of\ngold-plated cedar, opening inwards, surrounded by a very large\nprojecting coping of plain silver, 3-1/2 ft. wide, severe simplicity of\nline throughout enormously multiplying the effect of richness of\nmaterial. The interior resembles, I believe, rather a Homeric, than an\nAssyrian or Egyptian house--except for the \'galleries,\' which are purely\nBabylonish and Old Hebrew. The inner court, with its wine-pool and\ntanks, is a small oblong of 8 ft. by 9 ft., upon which open four\nsilver-latticed window-oblongs in the same proportion, and two doors,\nbefore and behind, oblongs in the same proportion. Round this run the\neight walls of the house proper, the inner 10 ft. from the outer, each\nparallel two forming a single long corridor-like chamber, except the\nfront (east) two, which are divided into three apartments; in each side\nof the house are six panels of massive plain silver, half-an-inch\nthinner in their central space, where are affixed paintings, 22 or else\n21 taken at the burning of Paris from a place called \'The Louvre,\' and 2\nor else 3 from a place in England: so that the panels have the look of\nframes, and are surrounded by oval garlands of the palest amethyst,\ntopaz, sapphire, and turquoise which I could find, each garland being of\nonly one kind of stone, a mere oval ring two feet wide at the sides and\nnarrowing to an inch at the top and bottom, without designs. The\ngalleries are five separate recesses in the outer walls under the roofs,\ntwo in the east faÃ§ade, and one in the north, south, and west, hung with\npavilions of purple, blue, rose and white silk on rings and rods of\ngold, with gold pilasters and banisters, each entered by four steps from\nthe roof, to which lead, north and south, two spiral stairs of cedar. On\nthe east roof stands the kiosk, under which is the little lunar\ntelescope; and from that height, and from the galleries, I can watch\nunder the bright moonlight of this climate, which is very like\nlime-light, the for-ever silent blue hills of Macedonia, and where the\nislands of Samothraki, Lemnos, Tenedos slumber like purplish fairies on\nthe Aegean Sea: for, usually, I sleep during the day, and keep a\nnight-long vigil, often at midnight descending to bathe my coloured\nbaths in the lake, and to disport myself in that strange intoxication of\nnostrils, eyes, and pores, dreaming long wide-eyed dreams at the bottom,\nto return dazed, and weak, and drunken. Or again--_twice_ within these\nlast void and idle six months--I have suddenly run, bawling out, from\nthis temple of luxury, tearing off my gaudy rags, to hide in a hut by\nthe shore, smitten for one intense moment with realisation of the past\nof this earth, and moaning: \'alone, alone ... all alone, alone, alone\n... alone, alone....\' For events precisely resembling eruptions take\nplace in my brain; and one spangled midnight--ah, how spangled!--I may\nkneel on the roof with streaming, uplifted face, with outspread arms,\nand awe-struck heart, adoring the Eternal: the next, I may strut like a\ncock, wanton as sin, lusting to burn a city, to wallow in filth, and,\nlike the Babylonian maniac, calling myself the equal of Heaven.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was not to write of this--of all this--!\n\nOf the furnishing of the palace I have written nothing.... But why I\nhesitate to admit to myself what I _know_, is not clear. If They speak\nto me, I may surely write of Them: for I do not fear Them, but am Their\npeer.\n\nOf the island I have written nothing: its size, climate, form,\nvegetation.... There are two winds: a north and a south wind; the north\nis cool, and the south is warm; and the south blows during the winter\nmonths, so that sometimes on Christmas-day it is quite hot; and the\nnorth, which is cool, blows from May to September, so that the summer is\nhardly ever oppressive, and the climate was made for a king. The\nmangal-stove in the south hall I have never once lit.\n\nThe length, I should say, is 19 miles; the breadth 10, or thereabouts;\nand the highest mountains should reach a height of some 2,000 ft.,\nthough I have not been all over it. It is very densely wooded in most\nparts, and I have seen large growths of wheat and barley, obviously\ndegenerate now, with currants, figs, valonia, tobacco, vines in rank\nabundance, and two marble quarries. From the palace, which lies on a\nsunny plateau of beautifully-sloping swards, dotted with the circular\nshadows thrown by fifteen huge cedars, and seven planes, I can see on\nall sides an edge of forest, with the gleam of a lake to the north, and\nin the hollow to the east the rivulet with its little bridge, and a few\nclumps and beds of flowers. I can also spy right through----\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt shall be written now:\n\nI have this day heard within me the contention of the Voices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that they were done with me! That all, all, all, was ended! I\nhave not heard them for twenty years!\n\nBut to-day--distinctly--breaking in with brawling impassioned\nsuddenness upon my consciousness.... I heard.\n\nThis late _far niente_ and vacuous inaction here have been undermining\nmy spirit; this inert brooding upon the earth; this empty life, and\nbursting brain! Immediately after eating at noon to-day, I said to\nmyself:\n\n\'I have been duped by the palace: for I have wasted myself in building,\nhoping for peace, and there is no peace. Therefore now I shall fly from\nit, to another, sweeter work--not of building, but of destroying--not of\nHeaven, but of Hell--not of self-denial, but of reddest orgy.\nConstantinople--beware!\' I tossed the chair aside, and with a stamp was\non my feet: and as I stood--again, again--I heard: the startlingly\nsudden wrangle, the fierce, vulgar outbreak and voluble controversy,\ntill my consciousness could not hear its ears: and one urged: \'Go! go!\'\nand the other: \'Not there...! where you like, ... but not there...! for\nyour life!\'\n\nI did not--for I could not--go: I was so overcome. I fell upon the couch\nshivering.\n\nThese Voices, or impulses, plainly as I felt them of old, quarrel within\nme now with an openness new to them. Lately, influenced by my long\nscientific habit of thought, I have occasionally wondered whether what I\nused to call \'the two Voices\' were not in reality two strong\ninstinctive movements, such as most men may have felt, though with less\nforce. But to-day doubt is past, doubt is past: nor, unless I be very\nmad, can I ever doubt again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have been thinking, thinking of my life: there is a something which I\ncannot understand.\n\nThere was a man whom I met once in that dark backward and abysm of time,\nwhen I must have been very young--I fancy at some college or school in\nEngland, and his name now is far enough beyond scope of my memory, lost\nin the vast limbo of past things. But he used to talk continually about\ncertain \'Black\' and \'White\' Powers, and of their strife for this world.\nHe was a short man with a Roman nose, and lived in fear of growing a\npaunch. His forehead a-top, in profile, was more prominent than the\nnose-end, he parted his hair in the middle, and had the theory that the\nmale form was more beautiful than the female. I forget what his name\nwas--the dim clear-obscure being. Very profound was the effect of his\nwords upon me, though, I think, I used to make a point of slighting\nthem. This man always declared that \'the Black\' would carry off the\nvictory in the end: and so he has, so he has.\n\nBut assuming the existence of this \'Black\' and this \'White\' being--and\nsupposing it to be a fact that my reaching the Pole had any connection\nwith the destruction of my race, according to the notions of that\nextraordinary Scotch parson--then it must have been the power of \'_the\nBlack_\' which carried me, in spite of all obstacles, to the Pole. So far\nI can understand.\n\nBut _after_ I had reached the Pole, what further use had either White or\nBlack for me? Which was it--White or Black--that preserved my life\nthrough my long return on the ice--and _why_? It _could_ not have been\n\'the Black\'! For I readily divine that from the moment when I touched\nthe Pole, the only desire of the Black, which had previously preserved,\nmust have been to destroy me, with the rest. It must have been \'the\nWhite,\' then, that led me back, retarding me long, so that I should not\nenter the poison-cloud, and then openly presenting me the _Boreal_ to\nbring me home to Europe. But his motive? And the significance of these\nrecommencing wrangles, after such a silence? This I do not understand!\n\nCurse Them, curse Them, with their mad tangles! I care nothing for Them!\nAre there any White Idiots and Black Idiots--_at all_? Or are these\nVoices that I hear nothing but the cries of my own strained nerves, and\nI all mad and morbid, morbid and mad, mad, my good God?\n\nThis inertia here is _not good_ for me! This stalking about the palace!\nand long thinkings about Earth and Heaven, Black and White, White and\nBlack, and things beyond the stars! My brain is like bursting through\nthe walls of my poor head.\n\nTo-morrow, then, to Constantinople.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDescending to go to the ship, I had almost reached the middle of the\neast platform-steps, when my foot slipped on the smooth gold: and the\nfall, though I was not walking carelessly, had, I swear, all the\nviolence of a fall caused by a push. I struck my head, and, as I rolled\ndownward, swooned. When I came to myself, I was lying on the very bottom\nstep, which is thinly washed by the wine-waves: another roll and I\nsuppose I must have drowned. I sat there an hour, lost in amazement,\nthen crossed the causeway, came down to the _Speransa_ with the motor,\nwent through her, spent the day in work, slept on her, worked again\nto-day, till four, at both ship and time-fuses (I with only 700 fuses\nleft, and in Stamboul alone must be 8,000 houses, without counting\nGalata, Tophana, Kassim-pacha, Scutari, and the rest), started out at\n5.30, and am now at 11 P.M. lying motionless two miles off the north\ncoast of the island of Marmora, with moonlight gloating on the water, a\nfaint north breeze, and the little pale land looking immensely\nstretched-out, solemn and great, as if that were the world, and there\nwere nothing else; and the tiny island at its end immense, and the\n_Speranza_ vast, and I only little. To-morrow at 11 A.M. I will moor the\n_Speranza_ in the Golden Horn at the spot where there is that low damp\nnook of the bagnio behind the naval magazines and that hill where the\npalace of the Capitan Pacha is.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found that great tangle of ships in the Golden Horn wonderfully\npreserved, many with hardly any moss-growths. This must be due, I\nsuppose, to the little Ali-Bey and Kezat-Hanah, which flow into the Horn\nat the top, and made no doubt a constant current.\n\nAh, I remember the place: long ago I lived here some months, or, it may\nbe, years. It is the fairest of cities--and the greatest. I believe that\nLondon in England was larger: but no city, surely, ever _seemed_ so\nlarge. But it is flimsy, and will burn like tinder. The houses are made\nof light timber, with interstices filled by earth and bricks, and some\nof them look ruinous already, with their lovely faded tints of green\nand gold and red and blue and yellow, like the hues of withered flowers:\nfor it is a city of paints and trees, and all in the little winding\nstreets, as I write, are volatile almond-blossoms, mixed with\nmaple-blossoms, white with purple. Even the most splendid of the\nSultan\'s palaces are built in this combustible way: for I believe that\nthey had a notion that stone-building was presumptuous, though I have\nseen some very thick stone-houses in Galata. This place, I remember,\nlived in a constant state of sensation on account of nightly flares-up;\nand I have come across several tracts already devastated by fires. The\nministers-of-state used to attend them, and if the fire would not go\nout, the Sultan himself was obliged to be there, in order to encourage\nthe firemen. Now it will burn still better.\n\nBut I have been here six weeks, and still no burning: for the place\nseems to plead with me, it is so ravishing, so that I do not know why I\ndid not live here, and spare my toils during those sixteen nightmare\nyears; for two whole weeks the impulse to burn was quieted; and since\nthen there has been an irritating whisper at my ear which said: \'It is\nnot really like the great King that you are, this burning, but like a\nfoolish child, or a savage, who liked to see fireworks: or at least, if\nyou must burn, do not burn poor Constantinople, which is so charming,\nand so very old, with its balsamic perfumes, and the blossomy trees of\nwhite and light-purple peeping over the walls of the cloistered painted\nhouses, and all those lichened tombs--those granite menhirs and regions\nof ancient marble tombs between the quarters, Greek tombs, Byzantine,\nJew, Mussulman tombs, with their strange and sacred\ninscriptions--overwaved by their cypresses and vast plane-trees.\' And\nfor weeks I would do nothing: but roamed about, with two minds in me,\nunder the tropic brilliance of the sky by day, and the vast dreamy\nnights of this place that are like nights seen through azure-tinted\nglasses, and in each of them is not one night, but the thousand-and-one\nlong crowded nights of glamour and fancy: for I would sit on the immense\nesplanade of the Seraskierat, or the mighty grey stones of the porch of\nthe mosque of Sultan Mehmed-fatih, dominating from its great steps all\nold Stamboul, and watch the moon for hours and hours, so passionately\nbright she soared through clear and cloud, till I would be smitten with\ndoubt of my own identity, for whether I were she, or the earth, or\nmyself, or some other thing or man, I did not know, all being so silent\nalike, and all, except myself, so vast, the Seraskierat, and the\nSuleimanieh, and Stamboul, and the Marmora Sea, and the earth, and\nthose argent fields of the moon, all large alike compared with me, and\nmeasure and space were lost, and I with them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese proud Turks died stolidly, many of them. In streets of\nKassim-pacha, in crowded Taxim on the heights of Pera, and under the\nlong Moorish arcades of Sultan-Selim, I have seen the open-air barber\'s\nrazor with his bones, and with him the half-shaved skull of the\nfaithful, and the long two-hours\' narghile with traces of burnt tembaki\nand haschish still in the bowl. Ashes now are they all, and dry yellow\nbone; but in the houses of Phanar and noisy old Galata, and in the Jew\nquarter of Pri-pacha, the black shoe and head-dress of the Greek is\nstill distinguishable from the Hebrew blue. It was a mixed ritual of\ncolours here in boot and hat: yellow for Mussulman, red boots, black\ncalpac for Armenian, for the Effendi a white turban, for the Greek a\nblack. The Tartar skull shines from under a high taper calpac, the\nNizain-djid\'s from a melon-shaped head-piece; the Imam\'s and Dervish\'s\nfrom a grey conical felt; and there is here and there a Frank in\nEuropean rags. I have seen the towering turban of the Bashi-bazouk, and\nhis long sword, and some softas in the domes on the great wall of\nStamboul, and the beggar, and the street-merchant with large tray of\nwater-melons, sweetmeats, raisins, sherbet, and the bear-shewer, and the\nBarbary organ, and the night-watchman who evermore cried \'Fire!\' with\nhis long lantern, two pistols, dirk, and wooden javelin. Strange how all\nthat old life has come back to my fancy now, pretty vividly, and for the\nfirst time, though I have been here several times lately. I have gone\nout to those plains beyond the walls with their view of rather barren\nmountain-peaks, the city looking nothing but minarets shooting through\nblack cypress-tops, and I seemed to see the wild muezzin at some summit,\ncrying the midday prayer: \'_Mohammed Resoul Allah!_\'--the wild man; and\nfrom that great avenue of cypresses which traverses the cemetery of\nScutari, the walled city of Stamboul lay spread entire up to Phanar and\nEyoub in their cypress-woods before me, the whole embowered now in\ntrees, all that complexity of ways and dark alleys with overhanging\nbalconies of old Byzantine houses, beneath which a rider had to stoop\nthe head, where old Turks would lose their way in mazes of the\npicturesque; and on the shaded Bosphorus coast, to Foundoucli and\nbeyond, some peeping yali, snow-white palace, or old Armenian cot; and\nthe Seraglio by the sea, a town within a town; and southward the Sea of\nMarmora, blue-and-white, and vast, and fresh as a sea just born,\nrejoicing at its birth and at the jovial sun, all brisk, alert, to the\nshadowy islands afar: and as I looked, I suddenly said aloud a wild, mad\nthing, my God, a wild and maniac thing, a shrieking maniac thing for\nHell to laugh at: for something said with my tongue: \'_This city is not\nquite dead._\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree nights I slept in Stamboul itself at the palace of some sanjak-bey\nor emir, or rather dozed, with one slumbrous eye that would open to\nwatch my visitors Sinbad, and Ali Baba, and old Haroun, to see how they\nslumbered and dozed: for it was in the small luxurious chamber where the\nbey received those speechless all-night visits of the Turks, long rosy\nhours of perfumed romance, and drunkenness of the fancy, and visionary\nlanguor, sinking toward morning into the yet deeper peace of dreamless\nsleep; and there, still, were the white _yatags_ for the guests to sit\ncross-legged on for the waking dream, and to fall upon for the final\nswoon, and the copper brazier still scenting of essence-of-rose, and the\ncushions, rugs, hangings, the monsters on the wall, the\nhaschish-chibouques, narghiles, hookahs, and drugged pale cigarettes,\nand a secret-looking lattice beyond the door, painted with trees and\nbirds; and the air narcotic and grey with the pastilles which I had\nburned, and the scented smokes which I had smoked; and I all drugged and\nmumbling, my left eye suspicious of Ali there, and Sinbad, and old\nHaroun, who dozed. And when I had slept, and rose to wash in a room near\nthe overhanging latticed balcony of the faÃ§ade, before me to the north\nlay old Galata in sunshine, and that steep large street mounting to\nPera, once full at every night-fall of divans on which grave dervishes\nsmoked narghiles, and there was no space for passage, for all was\ndivans, lounges, almond-trees, heaven-high hum, chibouques in forests,\nthe dervish, and the innumerable porter, the horse-hirer with his horse\nfrom Tophana, and arsenal-men from Kassim, and traders from Galata, and\nartillery-workmen from Tophana; and on the other side of the house, the\nsouth end, a covered bridge led across a street, which consisted mostly\nof two immense blind walls, into a great tangled wilderness of flowers,\nwhich was the harem-garden, where I passed some hours; and here I might\nhave remained many days, many weeks perhaps, but that, dozing one\nfore-day with those fancied others, it was as if there occurred a laugh\nsomewhere, and a thing said: \'But this city is not quite dead!\' waking\nme from deeps of peace to startled wakefulness. And I thought to myself:\n\'If it be not quite dead, it _will_ be soon--and with some suddenness!\'\nAnd the next morning I was at the Arsenal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is long since I have so deeply enjoyed, even to the marrow. It may be\n\'the White\' who has the guardianship of my life: but assuredly it is\n\'the Black\' who reigns in my soul.\n\nGrandly did old Stamboul, Galata, Tophana, Kassim, right out beyond the\nwalls to Phanar and Eyoub, blaze and burn. The whole place, except one\nlittle region of Galata, was like so much tinder, and in the five hours\nbetween 8 P.M. and 1 A.M. all was over. I saw the tops of those vast\nmasses of cemetery-cypresses round the tombs of the Osmanlis outside the\nwalls, and those in the cemetery of Kassim, and those round the sacred\nmosque of Eyoub, shrivel away instantaneously, like flimsy hair caught\nby a flame; I saw the Genoese tower of Galata go heading obliquely on an\nupward curve, like Sir Roger de Coverley and wild rockets, and burst\nhigh, high, with a report; in pairs, and threes, and fours, I saw the\nblue cupolas of the twelve or fourteen great mosques give in and\nsubside, or soar and rain, and the great minarets nod the head, and\ntopple; and I saw the flames reach out and out across the empty breadth\nof the Etmeidan--three hundred yards--to the six minarets of the Mosque\nof Achmet, wrapping the red Egyptian-granite obelisk in the centre; and\nacross the breadth of the Serai-Meidani it reached to the buildings of\nthe Seraglio and the Sublime Porte; and across those vague barren\nstretches that lie between the houses and the great wall; and across the\nseventy or eighty great arcaded bazaars, all-enwrapping, it reached; and\nthe spirit of fire grew upon me: for the Golden Horn itself was a tongue\nof fire, crowded, west of the galley-harbour, with exploding\nbattleships, Turkish frigates, corvettes, brigs--and east, with tens of\nthousands of feluccas, caiques, gondolas and merchantmen aflame. On my\nleft burned all Scutari; and between six and eight in the evening I had\nsent out thirty-seven vessels under low horse-powers of air, with trains\nand fuses laid for 11 P.M., to light with their wandering fires the Sea\nof Marmora. By midnight I was encompassed in one great furnace and fiery\ngulf, all the sea and sky inflamed, and earth a-flare. Not far from me\nto the left I saw the vast Tophana barracks of the Cannoniers, and the\nArtillery-works, after long reluctance and delay, take wing together;\nand three minutes later, down by the water, the barrack of the\nBombardiers and the Military School together, grandly, grandly; and\nthen, to the right, in the valley of Kassim, the Arsenal: these\noccupying the sky like smoky suns, and shedding a glaring day over many\na mile of sea and land; I saw the two lines of ruddier flaring where the\nbarge-bridge and the raft-bridge over the Golden Horn made haste to\nburn; and all that vastness burned with haste, quicker and quicker--to\nfervour--to fury--to unanimous rabies: and when its red roaring stormed\nthe infinite, and the might of its glowing heart was Gravitation, Being,\nSensation, and I its compliant wife--then my head nodded, and with\ncrooked lips I sighed as it were my last sigh, and tumbled, weak and\ndrunken, upon my face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO wild Providence! Unfathomable madness of Heaven! that ever I should\nwrite what now I write! I will not write it....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hissing of it! It is only a crazy dream! a tearing-out of the hair\nby the roots to scatter upon the raving storms of Saturn! My hand will\nnot write it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn God\'s name----! During four nights after the burning I slept in a\nhouse--French as I saw by the books, &c., probably the Ambassador\'s, for\nit has very large gardens and a beautiful view over the sea, situated on\nthe rapid east declivity of Pera; it is one of the few large houses\nwhich, for my safety, I had left standing round the minaret whence I had\nwatched, this minaret being at the top of the old Mussulman quarter on\nthe heights of Taxim, between Pera proper and Foundoucli. At the bottom,\nboth at the quay of Foundoucli, and at that of Tophana, I had left under\nshelter two caiques for double safety, one a Sultan\'s gilt craft, with\ngold spur at the prow, and one a boat of those zaptias that used to\npatrol the Golden Horn as water-police: by one or other of these I meant\nto reach the _Speranza_, she being then safely anchored some distance up\nthe Bosphorus coast. So, on the fifth morning I set out for the Tophana\nquay; but a light rain had fallen over-night, and this had re-excited\nthe thin grey smoke resembling quenched steam, which, as from some\nreeking province of Abaddon, still trickled upward over many a square\nmile of blackened tract, though of flame I could see no sign. I had not\naccordingly advanced far over every sort of _dÃ©bris_, when I found my\neyes watering, my throat choked, and my way almost blocked by roughness:\nwhereupon I said: \'I will turn back, cross the region of tombs and\nbarren waste behind Pera, descend the hill, get the zaptia boat at the\nFoundoucli quay, and so reach the _Speranza_.\'\n\nAccordingly, I made my way out of the region of smoke, passed beyond the\nlimits of smouldering ruin and tomb, and soon entered a rich woodland,\nsomewhat scorched at first, but soon green and flourishing as the\njungle. This cooled and soothed me, and being in no hurry to reach the\nship, I was led on and on, in a somewhat north-western direction, I\nfancy. Somewhere hereabouts, I thought, was the place they called \'The\nSweet Waters,\' and I went on with the vague notion of coming upon them,\nthinking to pass the day, till afternoon, in the forest. Here nature, in\nonly twenty years has returned to an exuberant savagery, and all was now\nthe wildest vegetation, dark dells, rills wimpling through deep-brown\nshade of sensitive mimosa, large pendulous fuchsia, palm, cypress,\nmulberry, jonquil, narcissus, daffodil, rhododendron, acacia, fig. Once\nI stumbled upon a cemetery of old gilt tombs, absolutely overgrown and\nlost, and thrice caught glimpses of little trellised yalis choked in\nboscage. With slow and listless foot I went, munching an almond or an\nolive, though I could swear that olives were not formerly indigenous to\nany soil so northern: yet here they are now, pretty plentiful, though\nelementary, so that modifications whose end I cannot see are certainly\nproceeding in everything, some of the cypresses which I met that day\nbeing immense beyond anything I ever heard of: and the thought, I\nremember, was in my head, that if a twig or leaf should change into a\nbird, or a fish with wings, and fly before my eyes, what then should I\ndo? and I would eye a branch suspiciously anon. After a long time I\npenetrated into a very sombre grove. The day outside the wood was\nbrilliant and hot, and very still, the leaves and flowers here all\nmotionless. I seemed, as it were, to hear the vacant silence of the\nworld, and my foot treading on a twig, produced the report of pistols. I\npresently reached a glade in a thicket, about eight yards across, that\nhad a scent of lime and orange, where the just-sufficient twilight\nenabled me to see some old bones, three skulls, and the edge of a\ntam-tam peeping from a tuft of wild corn with corn-flowers, and here and\nthere some golden champac, and all about a profusion of musk-roses. I\nhad stopped--_why_ I do not recollect--perhaps thinking that if I was\nnot getting to the Sweet Waters, I should seriously set about finding my\nway out. And as I stood looking about me, I remember that some cruising\ninsect trawled near my ear its lonely drone.\n\nSuddenly, God knows, I started, I started.\n\nI imagined--I dreamed--that I saw a pressure in a bed of moss and\nviolets, _recently made!_ And while I stood gloating upon that\nimpossible thing, I imagined--I dreamed--the lunacy of it!--that I heard\na laugh...! the laugh, my good God, of a human soul.\n\nOr it seemed half a laugh, and half a sob: and it passed from me in one\nfleeting instant.\n\nLaughs, and sobs, and idiot hallucinations, I had often heard before,\nfeet walking, sounds behind me: and even as I had heard them, I had\nknown that they were nothing. But brief as was this impression, it was\nyet so thrillingly _real_, that my poor heart received, as it were, the\nvery shock of death, and I fell backward into a mass of moss, supported\non the right palm, while the left pressed my working bosom; and there,\ntoiling to catch my breath, I lay still, all my soul focussed into my\nears. But now I could hear no sound, save only the vast and audible hum\nof the silence of the universe.\n\n\nThere was, however, the foot-print. If my eye and ear should so\nconspire against me, that, I thought, was hard.\n\nStill I lay, still, in that same pose, without a stir, sick and\ndry-mouthed, infirm and languishing, with dying breaths: but keen,\nkeen--and malign.\n\nI would wait, I said to myself, I would be artful as snakes, though so\nwoefully sick and invalid: I would make no sound....\n\nAfter some minutes I became conscious that my eyes were leering--leering\nin one fixed direction: and instantly, the mere fact that I had a sense\nof direction proved to me that I must, _in truth_, have heard something!\nI strove--I managed--to raise myself: and as I stood upright, feebly\nswaying there, not the terrors of death alone were in my breast, but the\nauthority of the monarch was on my brow.\n\nI moved: I found the strength.\n\nSlow step by slow step, with daintiest noiselessness, I moved to a\nthread of moss that from the glade passed into the thicket, and along\nits winding way I stepped, in the direction of the sound. Now my ears\ncaught the purling noise of a brooklet, and following the moss-path, I\nwas led into a mass of bush only two or three feet higher than my head.\nThrough this, prowling like a stealthy cat, I wheedled my painful way,\nemerged upon a strip of open long-grass, and now was faced, three yards\nbefore me, by a wall of acacia-trees, prickly-pear and pichulas, between\nwhich and a forest beyond I spied a gleam of running water.\n\nOn hands and knees I crept toward the acacia-thicket, entered it a\nlittle, and leaning far forward, peered. And there--at once--ten yards\nto my right--I saw.\n\nSingular to say, my agitation, instead of intensifying to the point of\napoplexy and death, now, at the actual sight, subsided to something very\nlike calmness. With malign and sullen eye askance I stood, and steadily\nI watched her there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was on her knees, her palms lightly touching the ground, supporting\nher. At the edge of the streamlet she knelt, and she was looking with a\nspecies of startled shy astonishment at the reflexion of her face in the\nlimpid brown water. And I, with sullen eye askance regarded her a good\nten minutes\' space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI believe that her momentary laugh and sob, which I had heard, was the\nresult of surprise at seeing her own image; and I firmly believe, from\nthe expression of her face, that this was the first time that she had\nseen it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever, I thought, as I stood moodily gazing, had I seen on the earth a\ncreature so fair (though, analysing now at leisure, I can quite conclude\nthat there was nothing at all remarkable about her good looks). Her\nhair, somewhat lighter than auburn, and frizzy, was a real garment to\nher nakedness, covering her below the hips, some strings of it falling,\ntoo, into the water: her eyes, a dark blue, were wide in a most silly\nexpression of bewilderment. Even as I eyed and eyed her, she slowly\nrose: and at once I saw in all her manner an air of unfamiliarity with\nthe world, as of one wholly at a loss what to do. Her pupils did not\nseem accustomed to light; and I could swear that that was the first day\nin which she had seen a tree or a stream.\n\nHer age appeared eighteen or twenty. I guessed that she was of\nCircassian blood, or, at least, origin. Her skin was whitey-brown, or\nold ivory-white.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood up motionless, at a loss. She took a lock of her hair, and\ndrew it through her lips. There was some look in her eyes, which I\ncould plainly see now, somehow indicating wild hunger, though the wood\nwas full of food. After letting go her hair, she stood again feckless\nand imbecile, with sideward-hung head, very pitiable to see I think now,\nthough no faintest pity touched me then. It was clear that she did not\nat all know what to make of the look of things. Finally, she sat on a\nmoss-bank, reached and took a musk-rose on her palm, and looked\nhopelessly at it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne minute after my first actual sight of her my extravagance of\nagitation, I say, died down to something like calm. The earth was mine\nby old right: I felt that: and this creature a mere slave upon whom,\nwithout heat or haste, I might perform my will: and for some time I\nstood, coolly enough considering what that will should be.\n\nI had at my girdle the little cangiar, with silver handle encrusted with\ncoral, and curved blade six inches long, damascened in gold, and sharp\nas a razor; the blackest and the basest of all the devils of the Pit was\nwhispering in my breast with calm persistence: \'Kill, kill--and eat.\'\n\n_Why_ I should have killed her I do not know. That question I now ask\nmyself. It must be true, true that it is \'_not good_\' for man to be\nalone. There was a religious sect in the Past which called itself\n\'Socialist\': and with these must have been the truth, man being at his\nbest and highest when most social, and at his worst and lowest when\nisolated: for the Earth gets hold of all isolation, and draws it, and\nmakes it fierce, base, and materialistic, like sultans, aristocracies,\nand the like: but Heaven is where two or three are gathered together. It\nmay be so: I do not know, nor care. But I know that after twenty years\nof solitude on a planet the human soul is more enamoured of solitude\nthan of life, shrinking like a tender nerve from the rough intrusion of\nAnother into the secret realm of Self: and hence, perhaps, the\nbitterness with which solitary castes, Brahmins, patricians,\naristocracies, always resisted any attempt to invade their\nslowly-acquired domain of privileges. Also, it may be true, it may, it\nmay, that after twenty years of solitary selfishness, a man becomes,\nwithout suspecting it--not at all noticing the slow stages--a real and\ntrue beast, a horrible, hideous beast, mad, prowling, like that King of\nBabylon, his nails like birds\' claws, and his hair like eagles\'\nfeathers, with instincts all inflamed and fierce, delighting in\ndarkness and crime for their own sake. I do not know, nor care: but I\nknow that, as I drew the cangiar, the basest and the slyest of all the\ndevils was whispering me, tongue in cheek: \'Kill, kill--and be merry.\'\n\nWith excruciating slowness, like a crawling glacier, tender as a nerve\nof the touching leaves, I moved, I stole, obliquely toward her through\nthe wall of bush, the knife behind my back. Once only there was a\nrestraint, a check: I felt myself held back: I had to stop: for one of\nthe ends of my divided beard had caught in a limb of prickly-pear.\n\nI set to disentangling it: and it was, I believe, at the moment of\nsucceeding that I first noticed the state of the sky, a strip of which I\ncould see across the rivulet: a minute or so before it had been pretty\nclear, but now was busy with hurrying clouds. It was a sinister\nmuttering of thunder which had made me glance upward.\n\nWhen my eyes returned to the sitting figure, she was looking foolishly\nabout the sky with an expression which almost proved that she had never\nbefore heard that sound of thunder, or at least had no idea what it\ncould bode. My fixed regard lost not one of her movements, while inch by\ninch, not breathing, careful as the poise of a balance, I crawled. And\nsuddenly, with a rush, I was out in the open, running her down....\n\nShe leapt: perhaps two, perhaps three, paces she fled: then stock still\nshe stood--within some four yards of me--with panting nostrils, with\nenquiring face.\n\nI saw it all in one instant, and in one instant all was over. I had not\nchecked the impetus of my run at her stoppage, and I was on the point of\nreaching her with uplifted knife, when I was suddenly checked and\nsmitten by a stupendous violence: a flash of blinding light, attracted\nby the steel which I held, struck tingling through my frame, and at the\nsame time the most passionate crash of thunder that ever shocked a poor\nhuman ear felled me to the ground. The cangiar, snatched from my hand,\nfell near the girl\'s foot.\n\nI did not entirely lose consciousness, though, surely, the Powers no\nlonger hide themselves from me, and their close contact is too\nintolerably rough and vigorous for a poor mortal man. During, I should\nthink, three or four minutes, I lay so astounded under that bullying cry\nof wrath, that I could not move a finger. When at last I did sit up, the\ngirl was standing near me, with a sort of smile, holding out to me the\ncangiar in a pouring rain.\n\nI took it from her, and my doddering fingers dropped it into the\nstream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPour, pour came the rain, raining as it can in this place, not long, but\na deluge while it lasts, dripping in thick-liquidity, like a profuse\nsweat, through the forest, I seeking to get back by the way I had come,\nflying, but with difficulty and slowness, and a feeling in me that I was\nbeing tracked. And so it proved: for when I struck into more open space,\nnearly opposite the west walls, but now on the north side of the Golden\nHorn, where there is a flat grassy ground somewhere between the valley\nof Kassim and Charkoi, with horror I saw that _protÃ©gÃ©e_ of Heaven, or\nof someone, not ten yards behind, following me like a mechanical figure,\nit being now near three in the afternoon, and the rain drenching me\nthrough, and I tired and hungry, and from all the ruins of\nConstantinople not one whiff of smoke ascending.\n\nI trudged on wearily till I came to the quay of Foundoucli, and the\nzaptia boat; and there she was with me still, her hair nothing but a\nthin drowned string down her back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot only can she not speak to me in any language that I know: but she\ncan speak in _no_ language: it is my firm belief that she has _never_\nspoken.\n\nShe never saw a boat, or water, or the world, till now--I could swear\nit. She came into the boat with me, and sat astern, clinging for dear\nlife to the gunwale by her finger-nails, and I paddled the eight hundred\nyards to the _Speranza_, and she came up to the deck after me. When she\nsaw the open water, the boat, the yalis on the coast, and then the ship,\nastonishment was imprinted on her face. But she appears to know little\nfear. She smiled like a child, and on the ship touched this and that, as\nif each were a living thing.\n\nIt was only here and there that one could see the ivory-brown colour of\nher skin: the rest was covered with dirt, like old bottles long lying in\ncellars.\n\nBy the time we reached the _Speranza_, the rain suddenly stopped: I went\ndown to my cabin to change my clothes, and had to shut the door in her\nface to keep her out. When I opened it, she was there, and she followed\nme to the windlass, when I went to set the anchor-engine going. I\nintended, I suppose, to take her to Imbros, where she might live in one\nof the broken-down houses of the village. But when the anchor was not\nyet half up, I stopped the engine, and let the chain run again. For I\nsaid, \'No, I will be alone, I am not a child.\'\n\nI knew that she was hungry by the look in her eyes: but I cared nothing\nfor that. I was hungry, too: and that was all I cared about.\n\nI would not let her be there with me another instant. I got down into\nthe boat, and when she followed, I rowed her back all the way past\nFoundoucli and the Tophana quay to where one turns into the Golden Horn\nby St. Sophia, around the mouth of the Horn being a vast semicircle of\ncharred wreckage, carried out by the river-currents. I went up the steps\non the Galata side before one comes to where the barge-bridge was. When\nshe had followed me on to the embankment, I walked up one of those\nrising streets, very encumbered now with stone-_dÃ©bris_ and ashes, but\nstill marked by some standing black wall-fragments, it being now not far\nfrom night, but the air as clear and washed as the translucency of a\ngreat purple diamond with the rain and the afterglow of the sun, and all\nthe west aflame.\n\nWhen I was about a hundred yards up in this old mixed quarter of Greeks,\nTurks, Jews, Italians, Albanians, and noise and cafedjis and\nwine-bibbing, having turned two corners, I suddenly gathered my skirts,\nspun round, and, as fast as I could, was off at a heavy trot back to\nthe quay. She was after me, but being taken by surprise, I suppose, was\ndistanced a little at first. However, by the time I could scurry myself\ndown into the boat, she was so near, that she only saved herself from\nthe water by a balancing stoppage at the brink, as I pushed off. I then\nset out to get back to the ship, muttering: \'You can have Turkey, if you\nlike, and I will keep the rest of the world.\'\n\nI rowed sea-ward, my face toward her, but steadily averted, for I would\nnot look her way to see what she was doing. However, as I turned the\npoint of the quay, where the open sea washes quite rough and loud, to go\nnorthward and disappear from her, I heard a babbling cry--the first\nsound which she had uttered. I did look then: and she was still quite\nnear me, for the silly maniac had been running along the embankment,\nfollowing me.\n\n\'Little fool!\' I cried out across the water, \'what are you after now?\'\nAnd, oh my good God, shall I ever forget that strangeness, that wild\nstrangeness, of my own voice, addressing on this earth another human\nsoul?\n\nThere she stood, whimpering like an abandoned dog after me. I turned the\nboat, rowed, came to the first steps, landed, and struck her two\nstinging slaps, one on each cheek. While she cowered, surprised no\ndoubt, I took her by the hand, led her back to the boat, landed on the\nStamboul side, and set off, still leading her, my object being to find\nsome sort of possible edifice near by, not hopelessly burned, in which\nto leave her: for in all Galata there was plainly none, and Pera, I\nthought, was too far to walk to. But it would have been better if I had\ngone to Pera, for we had to walk quite three miles from Seraglio Point\nall along the city battlements to the Seven-towers, she picking her\nbare-footed way after me through the great Sahara of charred stuff, and\nnight now well arrived, and the moon a-drift in the heaven, making the\ndesolate lonesomeness of the ruins tenfold desolate, so that my heart\nsmote me then with bitterness and remorse, and I had a vision of myself\nthat night which I will not put down on paper. At last, however, pretty\nlate in the evening, I spied a large mansion with green lattice-work\nfaÃ§ade, and shaknisier, and terrace-roof, which had been hidden from me\nby the arcades of a bazaar, a vast open space at about the centre of\nStamboul, one of the largest of the bazaars, I should think, in the\nmiddle of which stood the mansion, probably the home of pasha or vizier:\nfor it had a very distinguished look in that place. It seemed very\nlittle hurt, though the vegetation that had apparently choked the great\nopen space was singed to a black fluff, among which lay thousands of\ncalcined bones of man, horse, ass, and camel, for all was distinct in\nthe bright, yet so pensive and forlorn, moonlight, which was that\nEastern moonlight of pure astral mystery which illumines Persepolis, and\nBabylon, and ruined cities of the old Anakim.\n\nThe house, I knew, would contain divans, _yatags_, cushions, foods,\nwines, sherbets, henna, saffron, mastic, raki, haschish, costumes, and a\nhundred luxuries still good. There was an outer wall, but the foliage\nover it had been singed away, and the gate all charred. It gave way at a\npush from my palm. The girl was close behind me. I next threw open a\nlittle green lattice-door in the faÃ§ade under the shaknisier, and\nentered. Here it was dark, and the moment that she, too, was within, I\nslipped out quickly, slammed the door in her face, and hooked it upon\nher by a little hook over the latch.\n\nI now walked some yards beyond the court, then stopped, listening for\nher expected cry: but all was still: five minutes--ten--I waited: but no\nsound. I then continued my morose and melancholy way, hollow with\nhunger, intending to start that night for Imbros.\n\nBut this time I had hardly advanced twenty steps, when I heard a frail\nand strangled cry, apparently in mid-air behind me, and glancing, saw\nthe creature lying at the gateway, a white thing in black stubble-ashes.\nShe had evidently jumped, well outward, from a small casement of lattice\non a level with the little shaknisier grating, through which once peeped\nbright eyes, thirty feet aloft.\n\nI hardly believe that she was conscious of any danger in jumping, for\nall the laws of life are new to her, and, having sought and found the\nopening, she may have merely come with blind instinctiveness after me,\ntaking the first way open to her. I walked back, pulled at her arm, and\nfound that she could not stand. Her face was screwed with silent\npain--she did not moan. Her left foot, I could see, was bleeding: and by\nthe wounded ankle I took her, and dragged her so through the ashes\nacross the narrow court, and tossed her like a little dog with all my\nforce within the door, cursing her.\n\nNow I would not go back the long way to the ship, but struck a match,\nand went lighting up girandoles, cressets, candelabra, into a confusion\nof lights among great numbers of pale-tinted pillars, rose and azure,\nwith verd-antique, olive, and Portoro marble, and serpentine. The\nmansion was large, I having to traverse quite a desert of embroidered\nbrocade-hangings, slender columns, and Broussa silks, till I saw a\nstair-case doorway behind a Smyrna _portiÃ¨re_, went up, and wandered\nsome time in a house of gilt-barred windows, with very little furniture,\nbut palatial spaces, solitary huge pieces of _faÃ¯ence_ of inestimable\nage, and arms, my footfalls quite stifled in the Persian carpeting. I\npassed through a covered-in hanging-gallery, with one window-grating\noverlooking an inner court, and by this entered the harem, which\ndeclared itself by a greater luxury, bric-Ã\xa0-bracerie, and profusion of\nmanner. Here, descending a short curved stair behind a _portiÃ¨re_, I\ncame into a marble-paved sort of larder, in which was an old negress in\nblue dress, her hair still adhering, and an infinite supply of\nsweetmeats, French preserved foods, sherbets, wines, and so on. I put a\nnumber of things into a pannier, went up again, found some of those\nexquisite pale cigarettes which drunken in the hollow of an emerald,\nalso a jewelled two-yard-long chibouque, and tembaki: and with all\ndescended by another stair, and laid them on the steps of a little\nraised kiosk of green marble in a corner of the court; went up again,\nand brought down a still-snowy _yatag_ to sleep on; and there, by the\nkiosk-step, ate and passed the night, smoking for several hours in a\nstate of languor. In the centre of the court is a square marble well,\nlooking white through a rankness of wild vine, acacias in flower, weeds,\njasmines, and roses, which overgrew it, as well as the kiosk and the\nwhole court, climbing even the four-square arcade of Moorish arches\nround the open space, under one of which I had deposited a long lantern\nof crimson silk: for here no breath of the fire had come. About two in\nmorning I fell to sleep, a deeper peace of shadow now reigning where so\nlong the melancholy silver of the moon had lingered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout eight in the morning I rose and made my way to the front,\nintending that that should be my last night in this ruined place: for\nall the night, sleeping and waking, the thing which had happened filled\nmy brain, growing from one depth of incredibility to a deeper, so that\nat last I arrived at a sort of certainty that it could be nothing but a\ndrunken dream: but as I opened my eyes afresh, the deep-cutting\nrealisation of that impossibility smote like a pang of lightning-stroke\nthrough my being: and I said: \'I will go again to the far Orient, and\nforget\': and I started out from the court, not knowing what had become\nof her during the night, till, having reached the outer chamber, with a\nwild start I saw her lying there at the door in the very spot where I\nhad flung her, asleep sideways, head on arm ... Softly, softly, I stept\nover her, got out, and went running at a cautious clandestine trot. The\nmorning was in high _fÃªte_, most fresh and pure, and to breathe was to\nbe young, and to see such a sunlight lighten even upon ruin so vast was\nto be blithe. After running two hundred yards to one of the great broken\nbazaar-portals, I looked back to see if I was followed: but all that\nspace was desolately empty. I then walked on past the arch, on which a\ngreen oblong, once inscribed, as usual, with some text in gilt\nhieroglyphs, is still discernible; and, emerging, saw the great panorama\nof destruction, a few vast standing walls, with hollow Oriental windows\nframing deep sky beyond, and here and there a pillar, or half-minaret,\nand down within the walls of the old Seraglio still some leafless,\nbranchless trunks, and in Eyoub and Phanar leafless forests, and on the\nnorthern horizon Pera with the steep upper-half of the Iani-Chircha\nstreet still there, and on the height the European houses, and all\nbetween blackness, stones, a rolling landscape of ravine, like the hilly\npack-ice of the North if its snow were ink, and to the right Scutari,\nblack, laid low, with its vast region of tombs, and rare stumps of its\nforests, and the blithe blue sea, with the widening semicircle of\nfloating _dÃ©bris_, looking like brown foul scum at some points,\ncongested before the bridgeless Golden Horn: for I stood pretty high in\nthe centre of Stamboul somewhere in the region of the Suleimanieh, or of\nSultan-Selim, as I judged, with immense purviews into abstract distances\nand mirage. And to me it seemed too vast, too lonesome, and after\nadvancing a few hundred yards beyond the bazaar, I turned again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found the girl still asleep at the house-door, and stirring her with\nmy foot, woke her. She leapt up with a start of surprise, and a\nremarkable sinuous agility, and gazed an astounded moment at me, till,\nseparating reality from dream and habit, she realised me: but\nimmediately subsided to the floor again, being in evident pain. I pulled\nher up, and made her limp after me through several halls to the inner\ncourt, and the well, where I set her upon the weedy margin, took her\nfoot in my lap, examined it, drew water, washed it, and bandaged it with\na strip torn from my caftan-hem, now and again speaking gruffly to her,\nso that she might no more follow me.\n\nAfter this, I had breakfast by the kiosk-steps, and when I was\nfinished, put a mass of truffled _foie gras_ on a plate, brushed through\nthe thicket to the well, and gave it her. She took it, but looked\nfoolish, not eating. I then, with my forefinger, put a little into her\nmouth, whereupon she set hungrily to eat it all. I also gave her some\nginger-bread, a handful of bonbons, some Krishnu wine, and some\nanisette.\n\nI then started out afresh, gruffly bidding her stay there, and left her\nsitting on the well, her hair falling down the opening, she peering\nafter me through the bushes. But I had not half reached the ogival\nbazaar-portal, when looking anxiously back, I saw that she was limping\nafter me. So that this creature tracks me in the manner of a nutshell\nfollowing about in the wake of a ship.\n\nI turned back with her to the house, for it was necessary that I should\nplan some further method of eluding her. That was five days ago, and\nhere I have stayed: for the house and court are sufficiently agreeable,\nand form a museum of real _objets d\'art_. It is settled, however, that\nto-morrow I return to Imbros.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems certain that she never wore, saw, nor knew of, clothes.\n\nI have dressed her, first sousing her thoroughly with sponge and soap\nin luke-warm rose-water in the silver cistern of the harem-bath, which\nis a circular marbled apartment with a fountain and the complicated\nceilings of these houses, and frescoes, and gilt texts of the Koran on\nthe walls, and pale rose-silk hangings. On the divan I had heaped a\nnumber of selected garments, and having shewed her how to towel herself,\nI made her step into a pair of the trousers called _shintiyan_ made of\nyellow-striped white-silk; this, by a running string, I tied loosely\nround the upper part of her hips; then, drawing up the bottoms to her\nknees, tied them there, so that their voluminous baggy folds,\noverhanging still to the ankles, have rather the look of a skirt; over\nthis I put upon her a blue-striped chiffon chemise, or quamis, reaching\na little below the hips; I then put on a short jacket or vest of scarlet\nsatin, thickly embroidered in gold and precious stones, reaching\nsomewhat below the waist, and pretty tight-fitting; and, making her lie\non the couch, I put upon her little feet little yellow baboosh-slippers,\nthen anklets, on her fingers rings, round her neck a necklace of\nsequins, finally dyeing her nails, which I cut, with henna. There\nremained her head, but with this I would have nothing to do, only\npointing to the tarboosh which I had brought, to a square kerchief, to\nsome corals, and to the fresco of a woman on the wall, which, if she\nchose, she might copy. Lastly, I pierced her ears with the silver\nneedles which they used here: and after two hours of it left her.\n\nAbout an hour afterwards I saw her in the arcade round the court, and,\nto my great surprise, she had a perfect plait down her back, and over\nher head and brows a green-silk feredjeh, or hood, precisely as in the\npicture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere is a question, the answer to which would be interesting to me:\nWhether or not for twenty years--or say rather twenty centuries, twenty\neternal aeons--I have been stark mad, a raving maniac; and whether or\nnot I am now suddenly sane, sitting here writing in my right mind, my\nwhole mood and tone changed, or rapidly changing? And whether such\nchange can be due to the presence of only one other being in the world\nwith me?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis singular being! Where she has lived--and how--is a problem to which\nnot the faintest solution is conceivable. She had, I say, never seen\nclothes: for when I began to dress her, her perplexity was unbounded;\nalso, during her twenty years, she has never seen almonds, figs, nuts,\nliqueurs, chocolate, conserves, vegetables, sugar, oil, honey,\nsweetmeats, orange-sherbet, mastic, salt, raki, tobacco, and many such\nthings: for she showed perplexity at all these, hesitation to eat them:\nbut she has known and tasted _white wine_: I could see that. Here, then,\nis a mystery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have not gone to Imbros, but remained here some days longer observing\nher.\n\nI have allowed her to sit in a corner at meal-time, not far from where I\neat, and I have given her food.\n\nShe is wonderfully clever! I continually find that, after an incredibly\nshort time, she has most completely adapted herself to this or that.\nAlready she wears her outfit as coquettishly as though born to clothes.\nWithout at all seeming observant--for, on the contrary, she gives an\nimpression of great flightiness--she watches me, I am convinced, with\npretty exact observation. She knows precisely when I am speaking\nroughly, bidding her go, bidding her come, tired of her, tolerant of\nher, scorning her, cursing her. If I wish her to the devil, she quickly\ndivines it by my face, and will disappear. Yesterday I noticed\nsomething queer about her, and soon discovered that she had been\nstaining her lids with black kohol, like the _hanums_, so that, having\nfound a box, she must have guessed its use from the pictures.\nWonderfully clever!--imitative as a mirror. Two mornings ago I found an\nold mother-of-pearl kittur, and sitting under the arcade, touched the\nstrings, playing a simple air; I could just see her behind one of the\narch-pillars on the opposite side, and she was listening with apparent\neagerness, and, I fancied, panting. Well, returning from a walk beyond\nthe Phanar walls in the afternoon, I heard the same air coming out from\nthe house, for she was repeating it pretty faultlessly by ear.\n\nAlso, during the forenoon of the previous day, I came upon her--for\nfootsteps make no sound in this house--in the pacha\'s visitors\'-hall:\nand what was she doing?--copying the poses of three dancing-girls\nfrescoed there! So that she would seem to have a character as light as a\nbutterfly\'s, and is afraid of nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I know.\n\nI had observed that at the beginning of every meal she seemed to have\nsomething on her mind, going toward the door, hesitating as if to see\nwhether I would follow, and then returning. At length yesterday, after\nsitting to eat, she jumped up, and to my infinite surprise, said her\nfirst word: said it with a most quaint, experimental effort of the\ntongue, as a fledgling trying the air: the word \'_Come_.\'\n\nThat morning, meeting her in the court, I had told her to repeat some\nwords after me: but she had made no attempt, as if shy to break the long\nsilence of her life; and now I felt some sort of foolish pleasure in\nhearing her utter that word, often no doubt heard from me: and after\nhurriedly eating, I went with her, saying to myself: \'She must be about\nto shew me the food to which she is accustomed: and perhaps that will\nsolve her origin.\'\n\nAnd so it has proved. I have now discovered that to the moment when she\nsaw me, she had tasted only her mother\'s milk, dates, and that white\nwine of Ismidt which the Koran permits.\n\nAs it was getting dark, I lit and took with me the big red-silk lantern,\nand we set out, she leading, and walking confoundedly fast, slackening\nwhen I swore at her, and getting fast again: and she walks with a\ncertain levity, flightiness, and liberated _furore_, very hard to\ndescribe, as though space were a luxury to be revelled in. By what\ninstinctive cleverness, or native vigour of memory, she found her way I\ncannot tell, but she led me such a walk that night, miles, miles, till I\nbecame furious, darkness having soon fallen with only a faint moon\nobscured by cloud, and a drizzle which haunted the air, she without\nlight climbing and picking her thinly-slippered steps over mounds of\n_dÃ©bris_ and loosely-strewn masonry with unfailing agility, I\noccasionally splashing a foot with horror into one of those little ponds\nwhich always marked the Stamboul streets. When I was nearer her, I would\nsee her peer across and upward toward Pera, as if that were a remembered\nland-mark, and would note the perpetual aspen oscillations of the long\ncoral drops in her ears, and the nimble ply of her limbs, wondering with\na groan if Pera was our goal.\n\nOur goal was even beyond Pera. When we came to the Golden Horn, she\npointed to my caique which lay at the Old Seraglio steps, and over the\nwater we went, she lying quite at ease now, with her face at the level\nof the water in the centre of the crescent-shape, as familiarly as a\n_hanum_ of old engaged in some escapade through the crowded Babel of\nGalata and that north side of the Horn.\n\nThrough Galata we passed, I already cursing the journey: and, following\nthe line of the coast and the great steep thoroughfare of Pera, we came\nat last, almost in the country, to a great wall, and the entrance to an\nimmense terraced garden, whose limits were invisible, many of the trees\nand avenues being still intact.\n\nI knew it at once: I had lain a special fuse-train in the great palace\nat the top of the terraces: it was the royal palace, Yildiz.\n\nUp and up we went through the grounds, a few unburned old bodies in rags\nof uniform still discernible here and there as the lantern swung past\nthem, a musician in sky-blue, a fantassin and officer-of-the-guard in\nscarlet, forming a cross, with domestics of the palace in\nred-and-orange.\n\nThe palace itself was quite in ruins, together with all its surrounding\nbarracks, mosque, and seraglio, and, as we reached the top of the\ngrounds, presented a picture very like those which I have seen of the\nruins of Persepolis, only that here the columns, both standing and\nfallen, were innumerable, and all more or less blackened; and through\ndoorless doors we passed, down immensely-wide short flights of steps,\nand up them, and over strewed courtyards, by tottering fragments of\narcades, all roofless, and tracts of charcoal between interrupted\navenues of pillars, I following, expectant, and she very eager now.\nFinally, down a flight of twelve or fourteen rather steep and narrow\nsteps, very dislocated, we went to a level which, I thought, must be the\nfloor of the palace vaults: for at the bottom of the steps we stood on a\nlarge plain floor of plaster, which bore the marks of the flames; and\nover this the girl ran a few steps, pointed with excited recognition to\na hole in it, ran further, and disappeared down the hole.\n\nWhen I followed, and lowered the lantern a little, I saw that the drop\ndown was about eight feet, made less than six feet by a heap of\nstone-rubbish below, the falling of which had caused the hole: and it\nwas by standing on this rubbish-heap, I knew at once, that she must have\nbeen enabled to climb out into the world.\n\nI dropped down, and found myself in a low flat-roofed cellar, with a\nfloor of black earth, very fusty and damp, but so very vast in extent\nthat even in the day-time, I suppose, I could not have discerned its\nboundaries; I fancy, indeed, that it extends beneath the whole palace\nand its environs--an enormous stretch of space: with the lantern I could\nonly see a very limited portion of its area. She still led me eagerly\non, and I presently came upon a whole region of flat boxes, each about\ntwo feet square, and nine inches high, made of very thin laths, packed\nto the roof; and about a-hundred-and-fifty feet from these I saw, where\nshe pointed, another region of bottles, fat-bellied bottles in chemises\nof wicker-work, stretching away into gloom and total darkness. The\nboxes, of which a great number lay broken open, as they can be by merely\npulling with the fingers at a pliant crack, contain dates; and the\nbottles, of which many thousands lay empty, contain, I saw, old\nIsmidtwine. Some fifty or sixty casks, covered with mildew, some old\npieces of furniture, and a great cube of rotting, curling parchments,\nshowed that this cellar had been more or less loosely used for the\noccasional storage of superfluous stores and knick-knacks.\n\nIt was also more or less loosely used as a domestic prison. For in the\nlane between the region of boxes and the region of bottles, near the\nformer, there lay on the ground the skeleton of a woman, the details of\nwhose costume were still appreciable, with thin brass gyves on her\nwrists: and when I had examined her well, I knew the whole history of\nthe creature standing silent by my side.\n\nShe is the daughter of the Sultan, as I assumed when I had once\ndetermined that the skeleton is both the skeleton of her mother, and the\nskeleton of the Sultana.\n\nThat the skeleton was her mother is clear: for the cloud occurred just\ntwenty-one years since, and the dead woman was, of course, at that\nmoment in the prison, which must have been air-tight, and with her the\ngirl: but since the girl is quite certainly not much more than\ntwenty--she looks younger--she must at that time have been either unborn\nor a young babe: but a babe would hardly be imprisoned with another than\nits own mother. I am rather inclined to think that the girl was unborn\nat the moment of the cloud, and was born in the cellar.\n\nThat the mother was the Sultana is clear from her fragments of dress,\nand the symbolic character of her every ornament, crescent earrings,\nheron-feather, and the blue campaca enamelled in a bracelet. This poor\nwoman, I have thought, may have been the victim of some unbounded fit of\nimperial passion, incurred by some domestic crime, real or imagined,\nwhich may have been pardoned in a day had not death overtaken her master\nand the world.\n\nThere are four steep stone steps at about the centre of the cellar,\nleading up to a locked iron trap-door, apparently the only opening into\nthis great hole: and this trap-door must have been so nearly air-tight\nas to bar the intrusion of the poison in anything like deadly quantity.\n\nBut how rare--how strange--the coincidence of chances here. For, if the\ntrap-door was absolutely air-tight, I cannot think that the supply of\noxygen in the cellar, large as it was, would have been sufficient to\nlast the girl twenty years, to say nothing of what her mother used up\nbefore death: for I imagine that the woman must have continued to live\nsome time in her dungeon, sufficiently long, at least, to teach her\nchild to procure its food of dates and wine; so that the door must have\nbeen only just sufficiently hermetic to bar the poison, yet admit some\noxygen; or else, the place may have been absolutely air-tight at the\ntime of the cloud, and some crack, which I have not seen, opened to\nadmit oxygen after the poison was dispersed: in any case--the\nall-but-infinite rarity of the chance!\n\nThinking these things I climbed out, and we walked to Pera, where I\nslept in a great white-stone house in five or six acres of garden\noverlooking the cemetery of Kassim, having pointed out to the girl\nanother house in which to sleep.\n\nThis girl! what a history! After existing twenty years in a sunless\nworld hardly three acres wide, she one day suddenly saw the only sky\nwhich she knew collapse at one point! a hole appeared into yet a world\nbeyond! It was I who had come, and kindled Constantinople, and set her\nfree.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAh, I see something now! I see! it was for this that I was preserved: I\nto be a sort of new-fangled Adam--and this little creature to be my Eve!\nThat is it! _The White_ does not admit defeat: he would recommence the\nRace again! At the last, the eleventh hour--in spite of all--he would\nturn defeat into victory, and outwit that Other.\n\nHowever, if this be so--and I seem to see it quite clearly--then in that\nWhite scheme is a singular flaw: at _one point_, it is obvious, that\nelaborate Forethought fails: for I have a free will--and I refuse, I\nrefuse.\n\nCertainly, in this matter I am on the side of the Black: and since it\ndepends absolutely upon me, this time Black wins.\n\nNo more men on the earth after me, ye Powers! To _you_ the question may\nbe nothing more than a gambling excitement as to the final outcome of\nyour aÃ«rial squabble: but to the poor men who had to bear the wrongs,\nInquisitions, rack-rents, Waterloos, unspeakable horrors, it was hard\nearnest, you know! Oh the wretchedness--the deep, deep pain--of that\nbungling ant-hill, happily wiped out, my God! My sweetheart Clodagh ...\nshe was not an ideal being! There was a man called Judas who betrayed\nthe gentle Founder of the Christian Faith, and there was some Roman king\nnamed Galba, a horrid dog, and there was a French devil, Gilles de Raiz:\nand the rest were all much the same, much the same. Oh no, it was not a\ngood race, that small infantry which called itself Man: and here,\nfalling on my knees before God and Satan as I write, I swear, I swear:\nNever through me shall it spring and fester again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cannot realise her! Not at all, at all, at all! If she is out of my\nsight and hearing ten minutes, I fall to doubting her reality. If I lose\nher for half a day, all the old feelings, resembling certainties, come\nback, that I have only been dreaming--that this appearance cannot be an\nactual objective fact of life, since the impossible is impossible.\n\nSeventeen long years, seventeen long years, of madness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-morrow I start for Imbros: and whether this girl chooses to follow\nme, or whether she stays behind, I will see her from the moment I land\nno more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe must rise very early. I who am now regularly on the palace-roof at\ndawn, sometimes from between the pavilion-curtains of the galleries, or\nfrom the steps of the telescope-kiosk, may spy her far down below, a\ndainty microscopic figure, generally running about the sward, or gazing\nup in wonder at the palace from the lake-edge.\n\nIt is now three months since she came with me to Imbros.\n\nI left her the first night in that pale-yellow house with the two green\njalousies facing the beach, where there was everything that she would\nneed; but I knew that, like all the houses there now, it leaked\nprofusely, and the next day I went down to the curving stair, cut\nthrough the rock at the back and south of the village, climbed, and half\na mile beyond found that park and villa with gables, which I had noted\nfrom the sea. The villa is almost intact, very strongly built of\npurplish marble, though small, and very like a Western house, with\nshingles, and three gables, so that I think it must have been the yali\nof some Englishman, for it contains a number of English books, though\nthe only body I saw there was what looked like an Aararat Kurd, with\nspiral string wound down his turban, yellow ankle-pantaloons, and flung\nred shoulder-cloak; and all in the heavily-wooded park, and all about\nthe low rock-steps up the hill, profusions of man-dragora; and from the\nrock-steps to the house a narrow long avenue of acacias, mossy\nunderfoot, that mingle overhead, the house standing about four yards\nfrom the edge of the perpendicular sea-cliff, whence one can see the\n_Speranzas_ main top-mast, and broken mizzen-mast-head, in her quiet\nhaven. After examining the place I went down again to the village, and\nher house: but she was not there: and two hours long I paced about among\nthe weeds of these amateur little alleys and flat-roofed windowless\nhouses (though some have terrace-roofs, and a rare aperture), whose\nonce-raw yellows, greens, and blues look now like sunset tints when the\nlast flush is gone, and they fade dun. When at last she came running\nwith open mouth, I took her up the rock-steps, and into the house, and\nthere she has lived, one of the gable-tips, I now find (that overlooking\nthe sea), being just visible from the north-east corner of the\npalace-roof, two miles from it.\n\nThat night again, when I was leaving her, she made an attempt to follow\nme. But I was resolved to end it, then: and cutting a sassafras-whip I\ncut her deep, three times, till she ran, crying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo, then, what is my fate henceforth?--to think always, from sun to\nmoon, and from moon to sun, of one only thing--and that thing an object\nfor the microscope?--to become a sneaking Paul Pry to spy upon the silly\nmovements of one little sparrow, like some fatuous motiveless gossip of\nold, his occupation to peep, his one faculty to scent, his honey and his\nachievement to unearth the infinitely unimportant? I would kill her\nfirst!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am convinced that she is no stay-at-home, but roams continually over\nthe island: for thrice, wandering myself, I have come upon her.\n\nThe first time she was running with flushed face, intent upon striking\ndown a butterfly with a twig held in the left hand (for both hands she\nuses with dexterity). It was at about nine in the morning, in her park,\nnear the bottom where there are high grass-growths and ferny luxuriance\nbetween the close tree-trunks, and shadow, and the broken wall of an old\nfuneral-kiosk sunk aslant under moss, creepers, and wild flowers, behind\nwhich I peeped hidden and wet with dew. She has had the assurance to\nmodify the dress I put upon her, and was herself a butterfly, for\ninstead of the shintiyan, she had on a zouave, hardly reaching to the\nwaist, of saffron satin, no feredjÃ©, but a scarlet fez with violet\ntassel, and baggy pantaloons of azure silk; down her back the long\nauburn plait, quite neat, but all her front hair loose and wanton, the\nfez cocked backward, while I caught glimpses of her fugitive heels\nlifting out of the dropping slipper-sole. She is pretty clever, but not\nclever enough, for that butterfly escaped, and in one instant I saw her\nchange into weary and sad, for on this earth is nothing more fickle than\nthat Proteus face, which resembles a landscape swept with cloud-shadows\non a bright day. Fast beat my heart that morning, owing to the\nconsciousness that, while I saw, I was unseen, yet might be seen.\n\nAnother noontide, three weeks afterwards, I came upon her a good way up\nyonder to the west of the palace, sleeping on her arm in an alley\nbetween overgrown old trellises, where rioting wild vine buried her in\ngloom: but I had not been peeping through the bushes a minute, when she\nstarted up and looked wildly about, her quick consciousness, I imagine,\ndetecting a presence: though I think that I managed to get away unseen.\nShe keeps her face very dirty: all about her mouth was dry-stained with\na polychrome of grape, _mÃ»rs_, and other coloured juices, like\nslobbering _gamins_ of old. I could also see that her nose and cheeks\nare now sprinkled with little freckles.\n\nFour days since I saw her a third time, and then found that the\nprimitive instinct to represent the world in pictures has been working\nin her: for she was drawing. It was down in the middle one of the three\neast-and-west village streets, for thither I had strolled toward\nevening, and coming out upon the street from between an old wall and a\nhouse, saw her quite near. I pulled up short--and peered. She was lying\non her face all among grasses, a piece of yellow board before her, and\nin her fingers a chalk-splinter: and very intently she drew, her\ntongue-tip travelling along her short upper-lip from side to side,\nregularly as a pendulum, her fez tipped far back, and the left foot\nswinging upward from the knee. She had drawn her yali at the top, and\nnow, as I could see by peering well forward, was drawing underneath the\npalace--from memory, for where she lay it is all hidden: yet the palace\nit was, for there were the waving lines meant for the steps, the two\nslanting pillars, the slanting battlements of the outer court, and\nbefore the portal, with turban reaching above the roof, and my two\nwhisks of beard sweeping below the knees--myself.\n\nSomething spurred me, and I could not resist shouting a sudden ""Hi!""\nwhereupon she scrambled like a spring-bok to her feet, I pointing to the\ndrawing, smiling.\n\nThis creature has a way of mincing her pressed lips, while she shakes\nthe head, intensely cooing a fond laugh: and so she did then.\n\n""You are a clever little wretch, you know,"" said I, she cocking her eye,\ntrying to divine my meaning with vague smile.\n\n\'Oh, yes, a clever little wretch,\' I went on in a gruff voice, \'clever\nas a serpent, no doubt: for in the first case it was the Black who used\nthe serpent, but now it is the White. But it will not do, you know. Do\nyou know what you are to me, you? You are my Eve!--a little fool, a\nlittle piebald frog like you. But it will not do at all, at all! A nice\nrace it would be with you for mother, and me for father, wouldn\'t\nit?--half-criminal like the father, half-idiot like the mother: just\nlike the last, in short. They used to say, in fact, that the offspring\nof a brother and sister was always weak-headed: and from such a wedlock\ncertainly came the human race, so no wonder it was what it was: and so\nit would have to be again now. Well no--unless we have the children, and\ncut their throats at birth: and _you_ would not like that at all, I\nknow, and, on the whole, it would not work, for the White would be\nstriking a poor man dead with His lightning, if I attempted that. No,\nthen: the modern Adam is some eight to twenty thousand years wiser than\nthe first--you see? less instinctive, more rational. The first disobeyed\nby commission: I shall disobey by omission: only his disobedience was a\nsin, mine is a heroism. I have not been a particularly ideal sort of\nbeast so far, you know: but in me, Adam Jeffson--I swear it--the human\nrace shall at last attain a true nobility, the nobility of\nself-extinction. I shall turn out trumps: I shall prove myself stronger\nthan Tendency, World-Genius, Providence, Currents of Fate, White Power,\nBlack Power, or whatever is the name for it. No more Clodaghs, Lucrezia\nBorgias, Semiramises, Pompadours, Irish Landlords, Hundred-Years\'\nWars--you see?\'\n\nShe kept her left eye obliquely cocked like a little fool, wondering, no\ndoubt, what I was saying.\n\n\'And talking of Clodagh,\' I went on, \'I shall call you that henceforth,\nto keep me reminded. So that is your name--not Eve--but Clodagh, who was\na Poisoner, you see? She poisoned a poor man who trusted her: and that\nis your name now--not Eve, but Clodagh--to remind me, you most dangerous\nlittle speckled viper! And in order that I may no more see your foolish\nlittle pretty face, I decree that, for the future, you wear a _yashmak_\nto cover up your lips, which, I can see, were meant to be seductive,\nthough dirty; and you can leave the blue eyes, and the little\nwhite-skinned freckled nose uncovered, if you like, they being\ncommonplace enough. Meantime, if you care to see how to draw a palace--I\nwill show you.\'\n\nBefore I stretched my hand, she was presenting the board--so that she\nhad guessed something of my meaning! But some hard tone in my talk had\nwounded her, for she presented it looking very glum, her under-lip\npushing a little obliquely out, very pathetically, I must say, as always\nwhen she is just ready to cry.\n\nIn a few strokes I drew the palace, and herself standing at the portal\nbetween the pillars: and now great was her satisfaction, for she pointed\nto the sketched figure, and to herself, interrogatively: and when I\nnodded \'yes,\' she went cooing her fond murmurous laugh, with pressed\nand mincing lips: and it is clear that, in spite of my beatings, she is\nin no way afraid of me.\n\nBefore I could move away, I felt some rain-drops, and down in some\nseconds rushed a shower. I looked, saw that the sky was rapidly\ndarkening, and ran into the nearest of the little cubical houses,\nleaving her glancing sideways upward, with the quaintest artlessness of\ninterest in the downpour: for she is not yet quite familiarised with the\noperations of nature, and seems to regard them with a certain amiable\ninquisitive seriousness, as though they were living beings, comrades as\ngood as herself. She presently joined me, but even then stretched her\nhand out to feel the drops.\n\nNow there came a thunder-clap, the wind was rising, and rain spattering\nabout me: for the panes of these houses, made, I believe, of paper\nsaturated in almond-oil, have long disappeared, and rains, penetrating\nby roof and rare window, splash the bones of men. I gathered up my\nskirts to run toward other shelter, but she was before me, saying in her\nstrange experimental voice that word of hers: ""_Come_.""\n\nShe ran in advance, and I, with the outer robe over my head, followed,\nurging flinching way against the whipped rain-wash. She took the way by\nthe stone horse-pond, through an alley to the left between two blind\nwalls, then down a steep path through wood to the rock-steps, and up we\nran, and along the hill, to her yali, which is a mile nearer the village\nthan the palace, though by the time we pelted into its dry shelter we\nwere wet to the skin.\n\nSudden darkness had come, but she quickly found some matches, lit one,\nlooking at it with a certain meditative air, and applied it to a candle\nand to a bronze Western lamp on the table, which I had taught her to oil\nand light. Near a Western fire-place was a Turkish mangal, like one\nwhich she had seen me light to warm bath-waters in Constantinople, and\nwhen I pointed to it, she ran to the kitchen, returned with some chopped\nwood, and very cleverly lit it. And there for several hours I sat that\nnight, reading (the first time for many years): it was a book by the\npoet Milton, found in a glazed book-case on the other side of the\nfire-place: and most strange, most novel, I found those august words\nabout warring angels that night, while the storm raved: for this man had\nevidently taken no end of pains with his book, and done it gallantly\nwell, too, making the thing hum: and I could not conceive why he should\nhave been at that trouble--unless it were for the same reason that I\nbuilt the palace, because some spark bites a man, and he would be\nlike--but that is all vanity, and delusion.\n\nWell, there is a rage in the storms of late years which really\ntranscends bounds; I do not remember if I have noted it in these sheets\nbefore: but I never could have conceived a turbulence so huge. Hour\nafter hour I sat there that night, smoking a chibouque, reading, and\nlistening to the batteries and lamentations of that haunted air,\nshrinking from it, fearing even for the _Speranza_ by her quay in the\nsequestered harbour, and for the palace-pillars. But what astonished me\nwas that girl: for, after sitting on the ottoman to my left some time,\nshe fell sideways asleep, not the least fear about her, though I should\nhave thought that nervousness at such a turmoil would be so natural to\nher: and whence she has this light confidence in the world into which\nshe has so abruptly come I do not know, for it is as though someone\ninspired her with the mood of nonchalance, saying: \'Be of good cheer,\nand care not a pin about anything: for God is God.\'\n\nI heard the ocean swing hoarse like heavy ordnance against the cliffs\nbelow, where they meet the outer surface of the southern of the two\nclaws of land that form the harbour: and the thought came into my mind:\n\'If now I taught her to speak, to read, I could sometimes make her read\na book to me.\'\n\nThe winds seemed wilfully struggling for the house to snatch and wing it\naway into the drear Eternities of the night: and I could not but heave\nthe sigh: \'Alas for us two poor waifs and castaways of our race, little\nbits of flotsam and seaweed-hair cast up here a moment, ah me, on this\nshore of the Ages, soon to be dragged back, O turgid Eternity, into thy\nabysmal gorge; and upon what strand--who shall say?--shall she next be\nflung, and I, divided then perhaps by all the stretch of the\ntrillion-distanced astral gulf?\' And such a pity, and a wringing of the\nheart, seemed in things, that a tear fell from my eyes that ominous\nmidnight.\n\nShe started up at a gust of more appalling volume, rubbing her eyes,\nwith dishevelled hair (it must have been about midnight), listening a\nminute, with that demure, droll interest of hers, to the noise of the\nelements, and then smiled to me; rose then, left the room, and presently\nreturned with a pomegranate and some almonds on a plate, also some\ndelicious old sweet wine in a Samian cruche, and an old silver cup, gilt\ninside, standing in a zarf. These she placed on the table near me, I\nmurmuring: \'Hospitality.\'\n\nShe looked at the book, which I read as I ate, with lowered left\neye-lid, seeking to guess its use, I suppose. Most things she\nunderstands at once, but this must have baffled her: for to see one\nlooking fixedly at a thing, and not know what one is looking at it for,\nmust be very disconcerting.\n\nI held it up before her, saying:\n\n""Shall I teach you to read it? If I did, how would you repay me, you\nClodagh?""\n\nShe cocked her eyes, seeking to comprehend. God knows, at that moment I\npitied the poor dumb waif, alone in all the whole round earth with me.\nThe candle-flame, moved by the wind like a slow-painting brush,\nflickered upon her face, though every cranny was closed.\n\n""Perhaps, then,"" I said, ""I will teach you. You are a pitiable little\nderelict of your race, you know: and two hours every day I will let you\ncome to the palace, and I will teach you. But be sure, be careful. If\nthere be danger, I will kill you: assuredly--without fail. And let me\nbegin with a lesson now: say after me: \'White.\'""\n\nI took her hand, and got her to understand that I wanted her to repeat\nafter me.\n\n""White,"" said I.\n\n""Hwhite,"" said she.\n\n\'Power,\' said I.\n\n\'Pow-wer,\' said she.\n\n\'White Power,\' said I.\n\n\'Hwhite Pow-wer,\' said she.\n\n\'Shall not,\' said I.\n\n\'Sall not,\' said she.\n\n\'White Power shall not,\' said I.\n\n\'Hwhite Pow-wer sall not,\' said she.\n\n\'Prevail,\' said I.\n\n\'Fffail,\' said she, pronouncing the \'v\' with a long fluttering\n\'f\'-sound.\n\n\'Pre-vail,\' said I.\n\n\'Pe-vvvail,\' said she.\n\n\'White Power shall not prevail,\' said I.\n\n\'Hwhite Pow-wer sall not--fffail,\' said she.\n\nA thunder which roared as she said it seemed to me to go laughing\nthrough the universe, and a minute I looked upon her face with positive\nshrinking fear; till, starting up, I thrust her with violence from my\npath, and dashed forth to re-seek the palace and my bed.\n\nSuch was the ingratitude and fatality which my first attempt, four\nnights since, to teach her met with. It remains to be seen whether my\npity for her dumbness, or some servile tendency toward fellowship in\nmyself, will result in any further lesson. Certainly, I think not: for\nthough I have given my word, the most solemnly-pledged word may be\nbroken.\n\nSurely, surely, her presence in the world with me--for I suppose it is\nthat--has wrought some profound changes in my mood: for gone now\napparently are those turbulent hours when, stalking like a peacock, I\nflaunted my monarchy in the face of the Eternal Powers, with hissed\nblasphemies; or else dribbled, shaking my body in a lewd dance; or was\noff to fire some vast city and revel in redness and the chucklings of\nHell; or rolled in the drunkenness of drugs. It was mere frenzy!--I see\nit now--it was \'not good,\' \'not good.\' And it rather looks as if it were\npast--or almost. I have clipped my beard and hair, removed the earrings,\nand thought of modifying my attire. I will just watch to see whether she\ncomes loitering down there about the gate of the lake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer progress is like....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is nine months since I have written, on these sheets, those words,\n\'Her progress is like....\' being the beginning of some narrative in\nwhich something interrupted me: and since then I have had no impulse to\nwrite.\n\nBut I was thinking just now of the curious tricks and uncertainties of\nmy memory, and seeing the sheets, will record it here. I have lately\nbeen trying to recall the name of a sister of mine--some perfectly\nsimple name, I know--and the name of my old home in England: and they\nhave completely passed out of my cognizance, though she was my only\nsister, and we grew up closely together: some quite simple name, I\nforget it now. Yet I can\'t say that my memory is bad: there are\nthings--quite unexpected, unimportant things--which come up in my mind\nwith considerable clearness. For instance, I remember to have met in\nParis (I think), long before the poison-cloud, a little Brazilian boy of\nthe colour of weak coffee-and-milk, of whom she now constantly reminds\nme. He wore his hair short like a convict\'s, so that one could spy the\nfish-white flesh beneath, and delighted to play solitary about the\nstairs of the hotel, dressed up in the white balloon-dress of a Pierrot.\nI have the impression now that he must have had very large ears. Clever\nas a flea he was, knowing five or six languages, as it were by nature,\nwithout having any suspicion that that was at all extraordinary. She has\nthat same light, unconscious, and nonchalant cleverness, and easy way of\nlife. It is little more than a year since I began to teach her, and\nalready she can speak English with a quite considerable vocabulary, and\nperfect correctness (except that she does not pronounce the letter \'r\');\nshe has also read, or rather devoured, a good many books; and can write,\ndraw, and play the harp. And all she does without effort: rather with\nthe flighty naturalness with which a bird takes to the wing.\n\nWhat made me teach her to read was this: One afternoon, fourteen months\nor so ago, I from the roof-kiosk saw her down at the lake-rim, a book in\nhand; and as she had seen me looking steadily at books, so she was\nlooking steadily at it, with pathetic sideward head: so that I burst\ninto laughter, for I saw her clearly through the glass, and whether she\nis the simplest little fool, or the craftiest serpent that ever\nbreathed, I am not yet sure. If I thought that she has the least design\nupon my honour, it would be ill for her.\n\nI went to Gallipoli for two days in the month of May, and brought back a\nvery pretty little caique, a perfect slender crescent of the colour of\nthe moon, though I had two days\' labour in cutting through bush-thicket\nfor the passage of the motor in bringing it up to the lake. It has\npleased me to see her lie among the silk cushions of the middle, while\nI, paddling, taught her her first words and sentences between the hours\nof eight and ten in the evening, though later they became 10 A.M. to\nnoon, when the reading began, we sitting on the palace-steps before the\nportal, her mouth invariably well covered with the yashmak, the\nlesson-book being a large-lettered old Bible found at her yali. _Why_\nshe must needs wear the yashmak she has never once asked; and how much\nshe divines, knows, or intends, I have no idea, continually questioning\nmyself as to whether she is all simplicity, or all cunning.\n\nThat she is conscious of some profound difference in our organisation I\ncannot doubt: for that I have a long beard, and she none at all, is\namong the most patent of facts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have thought that a certain _Western-ness_--a growing modernity of\ntone--may be the result, as far as I am concerned, of her presence with\nme? I do not know....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is the gleam of a lake-end just visible in the north forest from\nthe palace-top, and in it a good number of fish like carp, tench, roach,\netc., so in May I searched for a tackle-shop in the Gallipoli\nFatmeh-bazaar, and got four 12-foot rods, with reels, silk-line,\nquill-floats, a few yards of silk-worm gut, with a packet of No. 7 and\n8 hooks, and split-shot for sinkers; and since red-worms, maggots and\ngentles are common on the island, I felt sure of a great many more fish\nthan the number I wanted, which was none at all. However, for the mere\namusement, I fished several times, lying at my length in a patch of\nlong-grass over-waved by an enormous cedar, where the bank is steep, and\nthe water deep. And one mid-afternoon she was suddenly there with me,\nquestioned me with her eyes, and when I consented, stayed: and presently\nI said I would teach her bottom-angling, and sent her flying up to the\npalace for another rod and tackle.\n\nThat day she did nothing, for after teaching her to thread the worm, and\nput the gentles on the smaller hooks, I sent her to hunt for worms to\nchop up for ground-baiting the pitch for the next afternoon; and when\nthis was done it was dinner-time, and I sent her home, for by then I was\ngiving the reading-lessons in the morning.\n\nThe next day I found her at the bank, taught her to take the sounding\nfor adjusting the float, and she lay down not far from me, holding the\nrod. So I said to her:\n\n\'Well, this is better than living in a dark cellar twenty years, with\nnothing to do but walk up and down, sleep, and consume dates and Ismidt\nwine.\'\n\n\'Yes!\' says she.\n\n\'Twenty years!\' said I: \'How did you bear it?\'\n\n\'I was not closs,\' says she.\n\n\'Did you never suspect that there was a world outside that cellar?\' said\nI.\n\n\'Never,\' says she, \'or lather, yes: but I did not suppose that it was\n_this_ world, but another where he lived.\'\n\n\'He who?\'\n\n\'He who spoke with me.\'\n\n\'Who was that?\'\n\n\'Oh! a bite!\' she screamed gladly.\n\nI saw her float bob under, and started up, rushed to her, and taught her\nhow to strike and play it, though it turned out when landed to be\nnothing but a tiny barbel: but she was in ecstasies, holding it on her\npalm, murmuring her fond coo.\n\nShe re-baited, and we lay again. I said:\n\n\'But what a life: no exit, no light, no prospect, no hope--\'\n\n\'Plenty of _hope_!\' says she.\n\n\'Good Heavens! hope of what?\'\n\n\'I knew vely well that something was lipening over the cellar, or under,\nor alound it, and would come to pass at a certain fixed hour, and that I\nshould see it, and feel it, and it would be vely nice.\'\n\n\'Ah, well, you had to wait for it, at any rate. Didn\'t those twenty\nyears seem _long_?\'\n\n\'No--at least sometimes--not often. I was always so occupied.\'\n\n\'Occupied in doing what?\'\n\n\'In eating, or dlinking, or lunning, or talking.\'\n\n\'Talking to your_self_?\'\n\n\'Not myself.\'\n\n\'To whom, then?\'\n\n\'To the one who told me when I was hungly, and put the dates to satisfy\nmy hunger.\'\n\n\'I see. Don\'t wriggle about in that way, or you will never catch any\nfish. The maxim of angling is: ""Study to be quiet""--\'\n\n\'O! another bite!\' she called, and this time, all alone, very agilely\nlanded a good-sized bream.\n\n\'But do you mean that you were never sad?\' said I when she was\nre-settled.\n\n\'Sometimes I would sit and cly,\' says she--\'I did not know why. But if\nthat was ""sadness,"" I was never miserlable, never, never. And if I\nclied, it did not last long, and I would soon fall to sleep, for he\nwould lock me in his lap, and kiss me, and wipe all my tears away.\'\n\n\'He who?\'\n\n\'Why, what a question! he who told me when I was hungly, and of the\nthing that was lipening outside the cellar, which would be so nice.\'\n\n\'I see, I see. But in all that dingy place, and thick gloom, were you\nnever at all afraid?\'\n\n\'Aflaid! _I_! of what?\'\n\n\'Of the unknown.\'\n\n\'I do not understand you. How could I be _aflaid_? The known was the\nvery opposite of tellible: it was merely hunger and dates, thirst and\nwine, the desire to lun and space to lun in, the desire to sleep and\nsleep: there was nothing tellible in that: and the unknown was even less\ntellible than the known: for it was the nice thing that was lipening\noutside the cellar. I do not understand--\'\n\n\'Ah, yes,\' said I, \'you are a clever little being: but your continual\nfluttering about is fatal to all angling. Isn\'t it in your nature to\nkeep still a minute? And with regard now to your habits in the\ncellar--?\'\n\n\'_Another!_\' she cried with happy laugh, and landed a young chub. And\nthat afternoon she caught seven, and I none.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother day I took her from the pitch to one of the kitchens in the\nvillage with some of the fish, till then always thrown away, and taught\nher cooking: for the only cooking-implement in the palace is the silver\nalcohol-lamp for coffee and chocolate. We both scrubbed the utensils,\nand boil and fry I taught her, and the making of a sauce from vinegar,\nbottled olives, and the tinned American butter from the _Speranza_, and\nthe boiling of rice mixed with flour for ground-baiting our pitch. And\nshe, at first astonished, was soon all deft housewifeliness, breathless\nofficiousness, and behind my back, of her own intuitiveness, grated some\ndry almonds found there, and with them sprinkled the fried tench. And we\nate them, sitting on the floor together: the first new food, I suppose,\ntasted by me for twenty-one years: nor did I find it disagreeable.\n\nThe next day she came up to the palace reading a book, which turned out\nto be a cookery-book in English, found at her yali; and a week later,\nshe appeared, out of hours, presenting me a yellow-earthenware dish\ncontaining a mess of gorgeous colours--a boiled fish under red peppers,\nbits of saffron, a greenish sauce, and almonds: but I turned her away,\nand would have none of her, or her dish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout a mile up to the west of the palace is a very old ruin in the\ndeepest forest, I think of a mosque, though only three truncated\ninternal pillars under ivy, and the weedy floor, with the courtyard and\nportal-steps remain, before it being a long avenue of cedars, gently\ndescending from the steps, the path between the trees choked with\nlong-grass and wild rye reaching to my middle. Here I saw one day a\nlarge disc of old brass, bossed in the middle, which may have been\neither a shield or part of an ancient cymbal, with concentric rings\ngraven round it, from centre to circumference. The next day I brought\nsome nails, a hammer, a saw, and a box of paints from the _Speranza_;\nand I painted the rings in different colours, cut down a slim\nlime-trunk, nailed the thin disc along its top, and planted it well,\nbefore the steps: for I said I would make a bull\'s-eye, and do rifle and\nrevolver practice before it, from the avenue. And this the next evening\nI was doing at four hundred feet, startling the island, it seemed, with\nthat unusual noise, when up she came peering with enquiring face: at\nwhich I was very angry, because my arm, long unused, was firing wide:\nbut I was too proud to say anything, and let her look, and soon she\nunderstood, laughing every time I made a considerable miss, till at last\nI turned upon her saying: \'If you think it so easy, you may try.\'\n\nShe had been wanting to try, for she came eagerly to the offer, and\nafter I had opened and showed her the mechanism, the cartridges, and how\nto shoot, I put into her hands one of the _Speranza_ Colt\'s. She took\nher bottom-lip between her teeth, shut her left eye, vaulted out the\nrevolver like an old shot to the level of her intense right eye, and\nsent a ball through the geometrical centre of the boss.\n\nHowever, it was a fluke-shot, for I had the satisfaction of seeing her\nmiss every one of the other five, except the last, which hit the black.\nThat, however, was three weeks since, and now my hitting record is forty\nper cent., and hers ninety-six--most extraordinary: so that it is clear\nthat this creature is the _protÃ©gÃ©e_ of someone, and favouritism is in\nthe world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer book of books is the Old Testament. Sometimes, at noon or afternoon,\nI may look abroad from the roof or galleries, and see a remote figure\nsitting on the sward under the shade of plane or black cypress: and I\nalways know that the book she cons there is the Bible--like an old\nRabbi. She has a passion for stories: and there finds a store.\n\nThree nights since when it was pretty late, and the moon very splendid,\nI saw her passing homewards close to the lake, and shouted down to her,\nmeaning to say \'Good-night\'; but she thought that I had called her, and\ncame: and sitting out on the top step we talked for hours, she without\nthe yashmak.\n\nWe fell to talking about the Bible. And says she: \'What did Cain to\nAbel?\'\n\n\'He knocked him over,\' I replied, liking sometimes to use such idioms,\nwith the double object of teaching and perplexing her.\n\n\'Over what?\' says she.\n\n\'Over his heels,\' said I.\n\n\'I do not complehend!\'\n\n\'He killed him, then.\'\n\n\'That I know. But how did Abel feel when he was killed? What is it to be\n_killed_?\'\n\n\'Well,\' said I, \'you have seen bones all around you, and the bones of\nyour mother, and you can feel the bones in your fingers. Your fingers\nwill become mere bone after you are dead, as die you must. Those bones\nwhich you see around you, are, of course, the bones of the men of whom\nwe often speak: and the same thing happened to them which happens to a\nfish or a butterfly when you catch them, and they lie all still.\'\n\n\'And the men and the butterfly feel the same after they are dead?\'\n\n\'Precisely the same. They lie in a deep drowse, and dream a\nnonsense-dream.\'\n\n\'That is not dleadful. I thought that it was much more dleadful. I\nshould not mind dying.\'\n\n\'Ah!... so much the better: for it is possible that you may have to die\na great deal sooner than you think.\'\n\n\'I should not mind. Why were men so vely aflaid to die?\'\n\n\'Because they were all such shocking cowards.\'\n\n\'Oh, not all! not all!\'\n\n(This girl, I know not with what motive, has now definitely set herself\nup against me as the defender of the dead race. With every chance she is\nat it.)\n\n\'Nearly all,\' said I: \'tell me one who was not afraid--\'\n\n\'There was Isaac,\' says she: \'when Ablaham laid him on the wood to kill\nhim, he did not jump up and lun to hide.\'\n\n\'Isaac was a great exception,\' said I: \'in the Bible and such books, you\nunderstand, you read of only the best sorts of people; but there were\nmillions and millions of others--especially about the time of the\npoison-cloud--on a very much lower level--putrid wretches--covetous,\nfalse, murderous, mean, selfish, debased, hideous, diseased, making the\nearth a very charnel of festering vices and crimes.\'\n\nThis, for several minutes, she did not answer, sitting with her back\nhalf toward me, cracking almonds, continually striking one step with the\nball of her outstretched foot. In the clarid gold of the platform I saw\nher fez and corals reflected as an elongated blotch of florid red. She\nturned and drank some wine from the great gold Jarvan goblet which I had\nbrought from the temple of Boro Budor, her head quite covered in by it.\nThen, the little hairs at her lip-corners still wet, says she:\n\n\'Vices and climes, climes and vices. Always the same. What were these\nclimes and vices?\'\n\n\'Robberies of a hundred sorts, murders of ten hundred--\'\n\n\'But what made them _do_ them?\'\n\n\'Their evil nature--their base souls.\'\n\n\'But _you_ are one of them, _I_ am another: yet you and I live here\ntogether, and we do no vices and climes.\'\n\nHer astounding shrewdness! Right into the inmost heart of a matter does\nher simple wit seem to pierce!\n\n\'No,\' I said, \'we do no vices and crimes, because we lack _motive_.\nThere is no danger that we should hate each other, for we have plenty to\neat and drink, dates, wines, and thousands of things. (Our danger is\nrather the other way.) But _they_ hated and schemed, because they were\nvery numerous, and there arose a question among them of dates and wine.\'\n\n\'Was there not, then, enough land to grow dates and wine for all?\'\n\n\'There was--yes: much more than enough, I fancy. But some got hold of a\nvast lot of it, and as the rest felt the pinch of scarcity, there arose,\nnaturally, a pretty state of things--including the vices and crimes.\'\n\n\'Ah, but then,\' says she, \'it was not to their bad souls that the vices\nand climes were due, but only to this question of land. It is certain\nthat if there had been no such question, there would have been no vices\nand climes, because you and I, who are just like them, do no vices and\nclimes here, where there is no such question.\'\n\nThe clear limelight of her intelligence! She wriggled on her seat in her\neffort of argument.\n\n\'I am not going to argue the matter,\' I said. \'There _was_ that question\nof dates and wine, you see. And there always must be on an earth where\nmillions of men, with varying degrees of cunning, reside.\'\n\n\'Oh, not at all necessalily!\' she cries with conviction: \'not at all, at\nall: since there are much more dates and wine than are enough for all.\nIf there should spling up more men now, having the whole wisdom,\nscience, and expelience of the past at their hand, and they made an\nallangement among themselves that the first man who tlied to take more\nthan he could work for should be killed, and sent to dleam a\nnonsense-dleam, the question could never again alise!\'\n\n\'It arose before--it would arise again.\'\n\n\'But no! I can guess clearly how it alose before: it alose thlough the\nsheer carelessness of the first men. The land was at first so vely, vely\nmuch more than enough for all, that the men did not take the tlouble to\nmake an allangement among themselves; and afterwards the habit of\ncarelessness was confirmed; till at last the vely oliginal carelessness\nmust have got to have the look of an allangement; and so the stleam\nwhich began in a little long ended in a big long, the long glowing more\nand more fixed and fatal as the stleam lolled further flom the source. I\nsee it clearly, can\'t you? But now, if some more men would spling, they\nwould be taught--\'\n\n\'Ah, but no more men will _spling_, you see--!\'\n\n\'There is no telling. I sometimes feel as if they must, and shall. The\ntlees blossom, the thunder lolls, the air makes me lun and leap, the\nglound is full of lichness, and I hear the voice of the Lord God walking\nall among the tlees of the folests.\'\n\nAs she said this, I saw her under-lip push out and tremble, as when she\nis near to crying, and her eyes moisten: but a moment after she looked\nat me full, and smiled, so mobile is her face: and as she looked, it\nsuddenly struck me what a noble temple of a brow the creature has,\nalmost pointed at the uplifted summit, and widening down like a\nbell-curved Gothic arch, draped in strings of frizzy hair which anon she\nshakes backward with her head.\n\n\'Clodagh,\' I said after some minutes--\'do you know why I called you\nClodagh?\'\n\n\'No? Tell me?\'\n\n\'Because once, long ago before the poison-cloud, I had a lover called\nClodagh: and she was a....\'\n\n\'But tell me first,\' cries she: \'how did one know one\'s lover, or one\'s\nwife, flom all the others?\'\n\n\'Well, by their faces....\'\n\n\'But there must have been many faces--all alike--\'\n\n\'Not all alike. Each was different from the rest.\'\n\n\'Still, it must have been vely clever to tell. I can hardly conceive\nany face, except yours and mine.\'\n\n\'Ah, because you are a little goose, you see.\'\n\n\'What was a goose like?\'\n\n\'It was a thing like a butterfly, only larger, and it kept its toes\nalways spread out, with a skin stretched between.\'\n\n\'Leally? How caplicious! And am I like that?--but what were you saying\nthat your lover, Clodagh, was?\'\n\n\'She was a Poisoner.\'\n\n\'Then why call me Clodagh, since _I_ am not a poisoner?\'\n\n\'I call you so to remind me: lest you--lest you--should become\nmy--lover, too.\'\n\n\'I am your lover already: for I love you.\'\n\n\'What, girl?\'\n\n\'Do I not love you, who are mine?\'\n\n\'Come, come, don\'t be a little maniac!\' I went. \'Clodagh was a\n_poisoner_....\'\n\n\'Why did she poison? Had she not enough dates and wine?\'\n\n\'She had, yes: but she wanted more, more, more, the silly idiot.\'\n\n\'So that the vices and climes were not confined to those that lacked\nthings, but were done by the others, too?\'\n\n\'By the others chiefly.\'\n\n\'Then I see how it was!\'\n\n\'How was it?\'\n\n\'The others had got _spoiled_. The vices and climes must have\nbegun with those who lacked things, and then the others, always seeing\nvices and climes alound them, began to do them, too--as when one rotten\nolive is in a bottle, the whole mass soon becomes collupted: but\noriginally they were not rotten, but only became so. And all though a\nlittle carelessness at the first. I am sure that if more men could\nspling now--\'\n\n\'But I _told_ you, didn\'t I, that no more men will spring? You\nunderstand, Clodagh, that originally the earth produced men by a long\nprocess, beginning with a very low type of creature, and continually\ndeveloping it, until at last a man stood up. But that can never happen\nagain: for the earth is old, old, and has lost her producing vigour now.\nSo talk no more of men _splinging_, and of things which you do not\nunderstand. Instead, go inside--stop, I will tell you a secret: to-day\nin the wood I picked some musk-roses and wound them into a wreath,\nmeaning to give them you for your head when you came to-morrow: and it\nis inside on the pearl tripod in the second room to the left: go,\ntherefore, and put it on, and bring the harp, and play to me, my dear.\'\n\nShe ran quick with a little cry, and coming again, sat crowned,\nincarnadine in the blushing depths of the gold. Nor did I send her home\nto her lonely yali, till the pale and languished moon, weary of\nall-night beatitudes, sank down soft-couched in quilts of curdling opals\nto the Hesperian realms of her rest.\n\nSo sometimes we speak together, she and I, she and I.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat ever I should write such a thing! I am driven out from Imbros!\n\nI was walking up in a wood yesterday to the west--it was a calm clear\nevening about seven, the sun having just set. I had the book in which I\nhave written so far in my hand, for I had thought of making a sketch of\nan old windmill to the north-west to show her. Twenty minutes before she\nhad been with me, for I had chanced to meet her, and she had come, but\nkept darting on ahead after peeping fruit, gathering armfuls of\namaranth, nenuphar, and red-berried asphodel, till, weary of my life, I\nhad called to her: \'Go away! out of my sight\'--and she, with suddenly\npushed under-lip, had walked off.\n\nWell, I was continuing my stroll, when I seemed to feel some quaking of\nthe ground, and before one could count twenty, it was as if the island\nwas bent upon wracking itself to pieces. My first thought was of her,\nand in great scare I went running, calling in the direction which she\nhad gone, staggering as on the deck of some labouring ship, falling,\npicking myself up, running again. The air was quite full of uproar, and\nthe land waving like the sea: and as I went plunging, not knowing\nwhither, I saw to my right some three or four acres of forest droop and\nsink into a gulf which opened to receive them. Up I flung my arms,\ncrying out: \'Good God! save the girl!\' and a minute later rushed out, to\nmy surprise, into open space on a hill-side. On the lower ground I could\nsee the palace, and beyond it, a small space of white sea which had the\nawful appearance of being higher than the land. Down the hill-side I\nstaggered, driven by the impulse to fly somewhither, but about half way\ndown was startled afresh by a shrill pattering like musical hail, and\nthe next moment saw the entire palace rush with the jangling clatter of\na thousand bells into the heaving lake.\n\nSome seconds after this, the earthquake, having lasted fully ten\nminutes, began to lull, and soon ceased. I found her an hour later\nstanding among the ruins of her little yali.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, what a thing! Probably every building on the island has been\ndestroyed; the palace-platform, all cracked, leans half-sunken askew\ninto the lake, like a huge stranded ark, while of the palace itself no\ntrace remains, except a mound of gold stones emerging above the lake to\nthe south. Gone, gone--sixteen years of vanity and vexation. But from a\npractical point of view, what is a worst calamity of all is that the\n_Speranza_ now lies high-and-dry in the village: for she was bodily\npicked up from the quay by the tidal wave, and driven bow-foremost into\na street not half her width, and there now lies, looking huge enough in\nthe little village, wedged for ever, smashed in at the nip like a frail\nmatch-box, a most astonishing spectacle: her bows forty feet up the\nstreet, ten feet above the ground at the stem, rudder resting on the\ninner edge of the quay, foremast tilted forward, the other two masts all\nright, and that bottom, which has passed through seas so far, buried in\nevery sort of green and brown seaweed, the old _Speranza_. Her steps\nwere there, and by a slight leap I could catch them underneath and go up\nhand-over-hand, till I got foothold; this I did at ten the same night\nwhen the sea-water had mostly drained back from the land, leaving\neverything very swampy, however; she there with me, and soon following\nme upon the ship. I found most things cracked into tiny fragments,\ntwisted, disfigured out of likeness, the house-walls themselves\ndisplaced a little at the nip, the bow of the cedar skiff smashed in to\nher middle against the aft starboard corner of the galley; and were it\nnot for the fact that the air-pinnace had not broken from her heavy\nropings, and one of the compasses still whole, I do not know what I\nshould have done: for the four old water-logged boats in the cove have\nutterly disappeared.\n\nI made her sleep on the cabin-floor amid the _dÃ©bris_ of berth and\neverything, and I myself slept high up in the wood to the west. I am\nwriting now lying in the long-grass the morning after, the sun rising,\nthough I cannot see him. My plan for to-day is to cut three or four logs\nwith the saw, lay them on the ground by the ship, lower the pinnace upon\nthem, so get her gradually down into the water, and by evening bid a\nlong farewell to Imbros, which drives me out in this way. Still, I look\nforward with pleasure to our hour\'s run to the Mainland, when I shall\nteach her to steer by the compass, and manipulate liquid-air, as I have\ntaught her to dress, to talk, to cook, to write, to think, to live. For\nshe is my creation, this creature: as it were, a \'rib from my side.\'\n\nBut what is the design of this expulsion? And what was it that she\ncalled it last night?--\'this new going out flom Halan\'! \'Haran,\' I\nbelieve, being the place from which Abraham went out, when \'called\' by\nGod.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe apparently felt only the tail of the earthquake at Imbros: for it has\nravaged Turkey! And we two poor helpless creatures put down here in the\ntheatre of all these infinite violences: it is too bad, too bad. For the\nrages of Nature at present are perfectly astonishing, and what it may\ncome to I do not know. When we came to the Macedonian coast in good\nmoonlight, we sailed along it, and up the Dardanelles, looking out for\nvillage, yali, or any habitation where we might put up: but everything\nhas apparently been wrecked. We saw Kilid-Bahr, Chanak-Kaleh, Gallipoli,\nLapsaki in ruins; at the last place I landed, leaving her in the boat,\nand walked a little way, but soon went back with the news that there was\nnot even a bazaar-arch left standing whole, in most parts even the line\nof the streets being obliterated, for the place had fallen like a house\nof dice, and had then been shaken up and jumbled. Finally we slept in a\nforest on the other side of the strait, beyond Gallipoli, taking our few\nprovisions, and having to wade at some points through morass a foot deep\nbefore we reached dry woodland.\n\nHere, the next morning, I sat alone--for we had slept separated by at\nleast half a mile--thinking out the question of whither I should go: my\nchoice would have been to remain either in the region where I was, or to\ngo Eastward: but the region where I was offered no dwelling that I could\nsee; and to go any distance Eastward, I needed a ship. Of ships I had\nseen during the night only wrecks, nor did I know where to find one in\nall these latitudes. I was thus, like her \'Ablaham,\' urged Westward.\n\nIn order, then, to go Westward, I first went a little further Eastward,\nonce more entered the Golden Horn, and once more mounted the scorched\nSeraglio steps. Here what the wickedness of man had spared, the\nwickedness of Nature had destroyed, and the few houses which I had left\nstanding round the upper part of Pera I now saw low as the rest; also\nthe house near the Suleimanieh, where we had lived our first days, to\nwhich I went as to a home, I found without a pillar standing; and that\nnight she slept under the half-roof of a little funeral-kiosk in the\nscorched cypress-wood of Eyoub, and I a mile away, at the edge of the\nforest where first I saw her.\n\nThe next morning, having met, as agreed, at the site of the Prophet\'s\nmosque, we traversed together the valley and cemetery of Kassim by the\nquagmires up to Pera, all the landscape having to me a rather twisted\nunfamiliar aspect. We had determined to spend the morning in searching\nfor supplies among the earthquake-ruins of Pera; and as I had decided to\ncollect sufficient in one day to save us further pains for some time, we\npassed a good many hours in this task, I confining myself to the great\nwhite house in the park overlooking Kassim, where I had once slept,\nlosing myself in the huge obliquities of its floors, roofs and\nwall-fragments, she going to the old Mussulman quarter of Djianghir\nnear, on the heights of Taxim, where were many shops, and thence round\nthe brow of the hill to the great French Embassy-house, overlooking\nFoundoucli and the sea, both of us having large Persian carpet-bags, and\nall in the air of that wilderness of ruin that morning a sweet, strong,\npermanent odour of maple-blossom.\n\nWe met toward evening, she quivering under such a load, that I would not\nlet her carry it, but abandoned my day\'s labour, which was lighter, and\ntook hers, which was quite enough: we went back Westward, seeking all\nthe while some shelter from the saturating night-dews of this place: and\nnothing could we find, till we came again, quite late, to her broken\nfuneral-kiosk at the entrance to the immense cemetery-avenue of Eyoub.\nThere without a word I left her among the shattered catafalques, for I\nwas weary; but having gone some distance, turned back, thinking that I\nmight take some more raisins from the bag; and after getting them, said\nto her, shaking her little hand where she sat under the roof-shadow on a\nstone:\n\n\'Good-night, Clodagh.\'\n\nShe did not answer promptly: and her answer, to my surprise, was a\nprotest against her name: for a rather sulky, yet gentle, voice came\nfrom the darkness, saying:\n\n\'I am _not_ a Poisoner!\'\n\n\'Well,\' said I, \'all right: tell me whatever you like that I should call\nyou, and henceforth I will call you that.\'\n\n\'Call me Eve,\' says she.\n\n\'Well, no,\' said I, \'not Eve, anything but that: for _my_ name is Adam,\nand if I called you Eve, that would be simply absurd, and we do not want\nto be ridiculous in each other\'s eyes. But I will call you anything else\nthat you like.\'\n\n\'Call me Leda,\' says she.\n\n\'And why Leda?\' said I.\n\n\'Because Leda sounds something like Clodagh,\' says she, \'and you are\nal-leady in the habit of calling me Clodagh; and I saw the name Leda in\na book, and liked it: but Clodagh is most hollible, most bitterly\nhollible!\'\n\n\'Well, then,\' said I, \'Leda it shall be, and I shan\'t forget, for I like\nit, too, and it suits you, and you ought to have a name beginning with\nan ""L."" Good-night, my dear, sleep well, and dream, dream.\'\n\n\'And to you, too, my God give dleams of peace and pleasantness,\' says\nshe; and I went.\n\nAnd it was only when I had lain myself upon leaves for my bed, my head\non my caftan, a rill for my lullaby, and two stars, which alone I could\nsee out of the heavenful, for my watch-lights; and only when my eyes\nwere already closed toward slumber, that a sudden strong thought pierced\nand woke me: for I remembered that Leda was the name of a Greek woman\nwho had borne twins. In fact, I should not be surprised if this Greek\nword Leda is the same word etymologically as the Hebrew Eve, for I have\nheard of _v\'s_, and _b\'s_, and _d\'s_ interchanging about in this way,\nand if _Di_, meaning God, or Light, and _Bi_, meaning Life, and Io_v_e,\nand Iho_v_ah and Go_d_, meaning much the same, are all one, that would\nbe nothing astonishing to me, as wi_d_ow, and veu_v_e, are one: and\nwhere it says, \'truly the Light is Good (_tob, b_on),\' this is as if it\nsaid, \'truly the Di is Di.\' Such, at any rate, is the fatality that\nattends me, even in the smallest things: for this Western Eve, or Greek\nLeda, had twins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the next morning we crossed by the ruins of old Greek Phanar\nacross the triple Stamboul-wall, which still showed its deep-ivied\nportal, and made our way, not without climbing, along the Golden Horn to\nthe foot of the Old Seraglio, where I soon found signs of the railway.\nAnd that minute commenced our journey across Turkey, Bulgaria, Servia,\nBosnia, Croatia, to Trieste, occupying no day or two as in old times,\nbut four months, a long-drawn nightmare, though a nightmare of rich\nhappiness, if one may say so, leaving on the memory a vague vast\nimpression of monstrous ravines, ever-succeeding profundities, heights\nand greatnesses, jungles strange as some moon-struck poet\'s fantasy,\neverlasting glooms, and a sound of mighty unseen rivers, cataracts, and\nslow cumbered rills whose bulrushes never see the sun, with largesse\neverywhere, secrecies, profusions, the unimaginable, the unspeakable, a\nsavagery most lush and fierce and gaudy, and vales of Arcadie, and\nremote mountain-peaks, and tarns shy as old-buried treasure, and\nglaciers, and we two human folk pretty small and drowned and lost in\nall that amplitude, yet moving always through it.\n\nWe followed the lines that first day till we came to a steam train, and\nI found the engine fairly good, and everything necessary to move it at\nmy hand: but the metals in such a condition of twisted, broken, vaulted,\nand buried confusion, due to the earthquake, that, having run some\nhundreds of yards to examine them, I saw that nothing could be done in\nthat way. At first this threw me into a condition like despair, for what\nwe were to do I did not know: but after persevering on foot for four\ndays along the deep-rusted track, which is of that large-gauge type\npeculiar to Eastern Europe, I began to see that there were considerable\nsound stretches, and took heart.\n\nI had with me land-charts and compass, but nothing for taking\naltitude-observations: for the _Speranza_ instruments, except one\ncompass, had all been broken-up by her shock. However, on getting to the\ntown of Silivri, about thirty miles from our start, I saw in the ruins\nof a half-standing bazaar-shop a number of brass objects, and there\nfound several good sextants, quadrants, and theodolites. Two mornings\nlater, we came upon an engine in mid-country, with coals in it, and a\nstream near; I had a goat-skin of almond-oil in the bag, and found the\nmachinery serviceable after an hour\'s careful inspection, having\nexamined the boiler with a candle through the manhole, and removed the\nautoclaves of the heaters. All was red with rust, and the shaft of the\nconnecting-rod in particular seemed so frail, that at one moment I was\nvery dubious: I decided, however, and, except for a slight leakage at\nthe tubulure which led the steam to the valve-chest, all went very well;\nat a pressure never exceeding three-and-a-half atmospheres, we travelled\nnearly a hundred and twenty miles before being stopped by a head-to-head\nblock on the line, when we had to abandon our engine; we then continued\nanother seven miles a-foot, I all the time mourning my motor, which I\nhad had to leave at Imbros, and hoping at every townlet to find a whole\none, but in vain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was wonderful to see the villages and towns going back to the earth,\nalready invaded by vegetation, and hardly any longer breaking the\ncontinuity of pure Nature, the town now as much the country as the\ncountry, and that which is not-Man becoming all in all with a certain\n_furore_ of vigour. A whole day in the southern gorges of the Balkan\nMountains the slow train went tearing its way through many a mile of\nbind-weed tendrils, a continuous curtain, flaming with large flowers,\nbut sombre as the falling shades of night, rather resembling jungles of\nCeylon and the Filipinas; and she, that day, lying in the single car\nbehind, where I had made her a little yatag-bed from Tatar Bazardjik,\ncontinually played the kittur, barely touching the strings, and crooning\nlow, low, in her rich contralto, eternally the same air, over and over\nagain, crooning, crooning, some melancholy tune of her own dreaming,\njust audible to me through the slow-travailing monotony of the engine;\ntill I was drunken with so sweet a woe, my God, a woe that was sweet as\nlife, and a dolour that lulled like nepenthe, and a grief that soothed\nlike kisses, so sweet, so sweet, that all that world of wood and gloom\nlost locality and realness for me, and became nothing but a charmed and\npensive Heaven for her to moan and lullaby in; and from between my\nfingers streamed plenteous tears that day, and all that I could keep on\nmourning was \'O Leda, O Leda, O Leda,\' till my heart was near to break.\n\nThe feed-pump eccentric-shaft of this engine, which was very poor and\nflaky, suddenly gave out about five in the afternoon, and I had to stop\nin a hurry, and that sweet invisible mechanism which had crooned and\ncrooned about my ears in the air, and followed me whithersoever I went,\nstopped too. Down she jumped, calling out:\n\n\'Well, I had a plesentiment that something would happen, and I am so\nglad, for I was tired!\'\n\nSeeing that nothing could be done with the feed-water pump, I got down,\ntook the bag, and parting before us the continuous screen, we went\npioneering to the left between a rock-cleft, stepping over large stones\nthat looked black with moss-growths, no sky, but hundreds of feet of\nimpenetrable leafage overhead, and everywhere the dew-dabbled profusion\nof dim ferneries, dishevelled maidenhairs mixed with a large-leaved\nmimosa, wild vine, white briony, and a smell of cedar, and a soft\nrushing of perpetual waters that charmed the gloaming. The way led\nslightly upwards three hundred feet, and presently, after some windings,\nand the climbing of five huge steps almost regular, yet obviously\nnatural, the gorge opened in a roundish space, fifty feet across, with\nfar overhanging edges seven hundred feet high; and there, behind a\ncurtain which fell from above, its tendrils defined and straight like a\nJapanese bead-hanging, we spread the store of foods, I opening the\nwines, fruits, vegetables and meats, she arranging them in order with\nthe gold plate, and lighting both the spirit-lamp and the lantern: for\nhere it was quite dark. Near us behind the curtain of tendrils was a\nsmall green cave in the rock, and at its mouth a pool two yards wide, a\nblack and limpid water that leisurely wheeled, discharging a little\nrivulet from the cave: and in it I saw three owl-eyed fish, a finger\nlong, loiter, and spur themselves, and gaze. Leda, who cannot be still\nin tongue or limb, chattered in her glib baby manner as we ate, and\nthen, after smoking a cigarette, said that she would go and \'lun,\' and\nwent, and left me darkling, for she is the sun and the moon and the host\nof the stars, I occupying myself that night in making a calendar at the\nend of this book in which I have written, for my almanack and many\nthings that I prized were lost with the palace--making a calendar,\ncounting the days in my head--but counting them across my thoughts of\nher.\n\nShe came again to tell me good-night, and then went down to the train to\nsleep; and I put out the lantern, and stooped within the cave, and made\nmy simple couch beside the little rivulet, and slept.\n\nBut a fitful sleep, and soon again I woke; and a long time I lay so,\ngradually becoming conscious of a slow dripping at one spot in the\ncave: for at a minute\'s interval it darkly splashed, regularly, very\ndeliberately; and it seemed to grow always louder and sadder, and the\nsplash at first was \'Leesha,\' but it became \'Leda\' to my ears, and it\nsobbed her name, and I pitied myself, so sad was I. And when I could no\nlonger bear the anguished melancholy of its spasm and its sobbing, I\narose and went softly, softly, lest she should hear in that sounding\nsilence of the hushed and darksome night, going more slow, more soft, as\nI went nearer, a sob in my throat, my feet leading me to her, till I\ntouched the carriage. And against it a long time I leant my clammy brow,\na sob aching in my poor throat, and she all mixed up in my head with the\nsuspended hushed night, and with the elfin things in the air that made\nthe silence so musically a-sound to the vacant ear-drum, and with the\ndripping splash in the cave. And softly I turned the door-handle, and\nheard her breathe in Asleep, her head near me; and I touched her hair\nwith my lips, and close to her ear I said--for I heard her breathe as if\nin sleep--\'Little Leda, I have come to you, for I could not help it,\nLeda: and oh, my heart is full of the love of you, for you are mine, and\nI am yours: and to live with you, till we die, and after we are dead to\nbe near you still, Leda, with my broken heart near your heart, little\nLeda--\'\n\nI must have sobbed, I think; for as I spoke close at her ears, with\npassionately dying eyes of love, I was startled by an irregularity in\nher breathing; and with cautious hurry I shut the door, and quite back\nto the cave I stole in haste.\n\nAnd the next morning when we met I thought--but am not now sure--that\nshe smiled singularly: I thought so. She may, she _may_, have heard--But\nI cannot tell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwice I was obliged to abandon engines on account of forest-tree\nobstructions right across the line, which, do what I might, I could not\nmove, and these were the two bitterest incidents of the pilgrimage; and\nat least thirty times I changed from engine to engine, when other trains\nblocked. As for the extent of the earthquake, it is pretty certain that\nit was universal over the Peninsula, and at many points exhibited\nextreme violence, for up to the time that we entered upon Servian\nterritory, we occasionally came upon stretches of the lines so\ndislocated, that it was impossible to proceed upon them, and during the\nwhole course I never saw one intact house or castle; four times, where\nthe way was of a nature to permit of it, I left the imbedded metals and\nmade the engine travel the ground till I came upon other metals, when I\nalways succeeded in driving it upon them. It was all very leisurely, for\nnot everywhere, nor every day, could I get a nautical observation, and\nhaving at all times to go at low pressures for fear of tube and boiler\nweakness, crawling through tunnels, and stopping when total darkness\ncame on, we did not go fast, nor much cared to. Once, moreover, for\nthree days, and once for four, we were overtaken by hurricanes of such\nvast inclemency, that no thought of travelling entered our heads, our\nonly care being to hide our poor cowering bodies as deeply and darkly as\npossible. Once I passed through a city (Adrianople) doubly devastated,\nonce by the hellish arson of my own hand, and once by the earthquake:\nand I made haste to leave that place behind me.\n\nFinally, three months and twenty-seven days from the date of the\nearthquake, having traversed only 900 odd English miles, I let go in the\nVenice lagoon, in the early morning of the 10th September, the lateen\nsail and stone anchor of a Maltese _speronare_, which I had found, and\npartially cleaned, at Trieste; and thence I passed up the Canalazzo in a\ngondola. For I said to Leda: \'In Venice will I pitch my Patriarch tent.\'\n\nBut to will and to do are not the same thing, and still further\nWestward was I driven. For the stagnant upper canals of this place are\nnow mere miasmas of pestilence: and within two days I was rolling with\nfever in the Old Procurazie Palace, she standing in pale wonderment at\nmy bed-side, sickness quite a novel thing to her: and, indeed, this was\nmy first serious illness since my twentieth year or thereabouts, when I\nhad over-worked my brain, and went a voyage to Constantinople. I could\nnot move from bed for some weeks, but happily did not lose my senses,\nand she brought me the whole pharmacopoeia from the shops, from which to\nchoose my medicines. I guessed the cause of this illness, though not a\nsign of it came near her, and as soon as my trembling knees could bear\nme, I again set out--always Westward--enjoying now a certain luxury in\ntravelling compared with that Turkish difficulty, for here were no\ntwisted metals, more and better engines, in the cities as many good\npetrol motors as I chose, and Nature markedly less savage.\n\nI do not know why I did not stop at Verona or Brescia, or some other\nneighbourhood of the Italian lakes, since I was fond of water: but I\nhad, I think, the thought in my head to return to Vauclaire in France,\nwhere I had lived, and there live: for I thought that she might like\nthose old monks. At all events, we did not remain long in any place till\nwe came to Turin, where we spent nine days, she in the house opposite\nmine, and after that, at her own suggestion, went on still, passing by\ntrain into the valley of the IsÃ¨re, and then into that of the Western\nRhone, till we came to the old town of Geneva among some very great\nmountains peaked with snow, the town seated at the head of a long lake\nwhich the earth has made in the shape of the crescent moon, and like the\nmoon it is a thing of much beauty and many moods, suggesting a creature\nunder the spell of charms and magics. However, with this idea of\nVauclaire still in my head, we left Geneva in the motor which had\nbrought us at four in the afternoon of the 17th May, I intending to\nreach the town called Bourg that night about eight, and there sleep, so\nto go on to Lyons the next morning by train, and so, by the Bordeaux\nroute, make Vauclaire. But by some chance for which I cannot to this\nhour account (unless the rain was the cause), I missed the chart-road,\nwhich should have been fairly level, and found myself on mountain\ntracks, unconscious of my whereabouts, while darkness fell, and a\nwindless downpour that had a certain sullen venom in its superabundance\ndrenched us. I stopped several times, looking about for chÃ¢teau,\nchalet, or village, but none did I see, though I twice came upon railway\nlines; and not till midnight did we run down a rather steep pass upon\nthe shore of a lake, which, from its apparent vastness in the moonless\nobscurity, I could only suppose to be the Lake of Geneva once again.\nAbout two hundred yards to the left we saw through the rain a large\npile, apparently risen straight out of the lake, looking ghostly livid,\nfor it was of white stone, not high, but an old thing of complicated\nwhite little turrets roofed with dark red candle extinguishers, and\noddities of Gothic nooks, window slits, and outline, very like a\nfanciful picture. Round to this we went, drowned as rats, Leda sighing\nand bedraggled, and found a narrow spit of low land projecting into the\nlake, where we left the car, walked forward with the bag, crossed a\nsmall wooden drawbridge, and came upon a rocky island with a number of\nthick-foliaged trees about the castle. We quickly found a small open\nportal, and went throughout the place, quite gay at the shelter,\neverywhere lighting candles which we found in iron sconces in the rather\nqueer apartments: so that, as the castle is far seen from the shores of\nthe lake, it would have appeared to one looking thence a place suddenly\npossessed and haunted. We found beds, and slept: and the next day it\nturned out to be the antique Castle of Chillon, where we remained five\nlong and happy months, till again, again, Fate overtook us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morning after our coming, we had breakfast--our last meal\ntogether--on the first floor in a pentagonal room approached from a\nlower level by three little steps. In it is a ponderous oak table\npierced with a multitude of worm eaten tunnels, also three mighty high\nbacked chairs, an old oak desk covered still with papers, arras on the\nwalls, and three dark religious oil paintings, and a grandfathers clock:\nit is at about the middle of the chÃ¢teau, and contains two small, but\ndeep, three faced oriels, in each face four compartments with white\nstone shafts between, these looking south upon shrubs and the rocky edge\nof the island, then upon the deep blue lake, then upon another tiny\nisland containing four trees in a jungle of flowers, then upon the shore\nof the lake interrupted by the mouths of a river which turned out to be\nthe Rhone, then upon a white town on the slopes which turned out to be\nVilleneuve, then upon the great mountains back of Bouveret and St.\nGingolph, all having the surprised air of a resurrection just\ncompleted, everything new washed in dyes of azure, ultramarine, indigo,\nsnow, emerald, that fresh morning: so that one had to call it the best\nand holiest place in the world. These five old room walls, and oak\nfloor, and two oriels, became specially mine, though it was really\ncommon ground to us both, and there I would do many little things. The\npapers on the desk told that it had been the _bureau_ of one R.E. Gaud,\n\'_Grand Bailli_,\' whose residence the place no doubt had been.\n\nShe asked me while eating that morning to stay here, and I said that I\nwould see, though with misgiving: so together we went all about the\nhouse, and finding it unexpectedly spacious, I consented to stop. At\nboth ends are suites, mostly small rooms, infinitely quaint and cosy,\nfurnished with heavy Henri Quatre furniture and bed draperies; and there\nare separate, and as it were secret, spiral stairs for exit to each: so\nwe decided that she should have the suite overlooking the length of the\nlake, the mouths of the Rhone, Bouveret and Villeneuve; and I should\nhave that overlooking the spit of land behind and the little drawbridge,\nshore cliffs, and elmwood which comes down to the shore, giving at one\npoint a glimpse of the diminutive hamlet of Chillon; and, that decided,\nI took her hand in mine, and I said:\n\n\'Well, then, here we stay, both under the same roof--for the first time.\nLeda, I will not explain why to you, but it is dangerous, so much so\nthat it _may_ mean the death of one or other of us: deadly, deadly\ndangerous, my poor girl. You do not understand, but that is the fact,\nbelieve me, for I know it very well, and I would not tell you false.\nWell, then, you will easily comprehend, that this being so, you must\nnever on any account come near my part of the house, nor will I come\nnear yours. Lately we have been very much together, but then we have\nbeen active, full of purpose and occupation: here we shall be nothing of\nthe kind, I can see. You do not understand at all--but things are so. We\nmust live perfectly separate lives, then. You are nothing to me, really,\nnor I to you, only we live on the same earth, which is nothing at all--a\nmere chance. Your own food, clothes, and everything that you want, you\nwill procure for yourself: it is perfectly easy: the shores are crowded\nwith mansions, castles, towns and villages; and I will do the same for\nmyself. The motor down there I set apart for your private use: if I want\nanother, I will get one; and to-day I will set about looking you up a\nboat and fishing tackle, and cut a cross on the bow of yours, so that\nyou may know yours, and never use mine. All this is very necessary: you\ncannot dream how much: but I know how much. Do not run any risks in\nclimbing, now, or with the motor, or in the boat ... little Leda ...\'\n\nI saw her under-lip push, and I turned away in haste, for I did not care\nwhether she cried or not. In that long voyage, and in my illness at\nVenice, she had become too near and dear to me, my tender love, my dear\ndarling soul; and I said in my heart: \'I will be a decent being: I will\nturn out trumps.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder this castle is a sort of dungeon, not narrow, nor very dark, in\nwhich are seven stout dark-grey pillars, and an eighth, half-built into\nthe wall; and one of them which has an iron ring, as well as the ground\naround it, is all worn away by some prisoner or prisoners once chained\nthere; and in the pillar the word \'Byron\' engraved. This made me\nremember that a poet of that name had written something about this\nplace, and two days afterwards I actually came upon three volumes of the\npoet in a room containing a great number of books, many of them English,\nnear the Grand Bailli\'s _bureau_: and in one I read the poem, which is\ncalled \'The Prisoner of Chillon.\' I found it very affecting, and the\ndescription good, only I saw no seven rings, and where he speaks of the\n\'pale and livid light,\' he should speak rather of the dun and brownish\ngloom, for the word \'light\' disconcerts the fancy, and of either pallor\nor blue there is there no sign. However, I was so struck by the horror\nof man\'s cruelty to man, as depicted in this poem, that I determined\nthat she should see it; went up straight to her rooms with the book,\nand, she being away, ferreted among her things to see what she was\ndoing, finding all very neat, except in one room where were a number of\nprints called _La Mode_, and _dÃ©bris_ of snipped cloth, and medley.\nWhen, after two hours, she came in, and I suddenly presented myself,\n\'Oh!\' she let slip, and then fell to cooing her laugh; and I took her\ndown through a big room stacked with every kind of rifle, with\nrevolvers, cartridges, powder, swords, bayonets--evidently some official\nor cantonal magazine--and then showed her the worn stone in the dungeon,\nthe ring, the narrow deep slits in the wall, and I told the tale of\ncruelty, while the splashing of the lake upon the rock outside was heard\nwith a strange and tragic sound, and her mobile face was all one sorrow.\n\n\'How cruel they must have been!\' cries she with tremulous lip, her face\nat the same time reddened with indignation.\n\n\'They were mere beastly monsters,\' said I: \'it is nothing surprising if\nmonsters were cruel.\'\n\nAnd in the short time while I said that, she was looking up with a\nnew-born smile.\n\n\'Some others came and set the plisoner flee!\' cries she.\n\n\'Yes,\' said I, \'they did, but--\'\n\n\'That was good of them,\' says she.\n\n\'Yes,\' said I, \'that was all right, so far as it went.\'\n\n\'And it was a time when men had al-leady become cluel,\' says she: \'if\nthose who set him flee were so good when all the lest were cluel, what\nwould they have been at a time when all the lest were kind? They would\nhave been just like Angels....!\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this place fishing, and long rambles, were the order of the day, both\nfor her and for me, especially fishing, though a week rarely passed\nwhich did not find me at Bouveret, St. Gingolph, Yvoire, Messery, Nyon,\nOuchy, Vevay, Montreux, Geneva, or one of the two dozen villages,\ntownlets, or towns, that crowd the shores, all very pretty places, each\nwith its charm, and mostly I went on foot, though the railway runs right\nround the forty odd miles of the lake\'s length. One noon-day I was\nwalking through the main-street of Vevay going on to the Cully-road when\nI had a fearful shock, for in a shop just in front of me to the right I\nheard a sound--an unmistakable indication of life--as of clattering\nmetals shaken together. My heart leapt into my mouth, I was conscious of\nbecoming bloodlessly pale, and on tip-toe of exquisite caution I stole\nup to the open door--peeped in--and it was she standing on the counter\nof a jeweller\'s shop, her back turned to me, with head bent low over a\ntray of jewels in her hands, which she was rummaging for something. I\nwent _\'Hoh!\'_ for I could not help it, and all that day, till sunset, we\nwere very dear friends, for I could not part from her, we walking\ntogether by vor-alpen, wood, and shore all the way to Ouchy, she just\nlike a creature crazy that day with the bliss of living, rolling in\ngrasses and perilous flowery declines, stamping her foot defiantly at\nme, arrogant queen that she is, and then running like mad for me to\ncatch her, with laughter, _abandon_, carolling railleries, and the\nlevity of the wild ass\'s colt on the hills, entangling her loose-flung\nhair with Bacchic tendril and blossom, and drinking, in the passage\nthrough Cully, more wine, I thought, than was good: and the flaming\ndarts of lightning that shot and shocked me that day, and the inner\nsecret gleams and revelations of Beauty which I had, and the pangs of\nwhite-hot honey that tortured my soul and body, and were too much for\nme, and made me sick, oh Heaven, what tongue could express all that deep\nworld of things? And at Ouchy with a backward wave of my arm I silently\nmotioned her from me, for I was dumb, and weak, and I left her there:\nand all that long night her power was upon me, for she is stronger than\ngravitation, which may be evaded, and than all the forces of life\ncombined, and the sun and the moon and the earth are nothing compared\nwith her; and when she was gone from me I was like a fish in the air, or\nlike a bird in the deep, for she is my element of life, made for me to\nbreathe in, and I drown without her: so that for many hours I lay on\nthat grassy hill leading to the burial-ground outside Ouchy that night,\nlike a man sore wounded, biting the grass.\n\nWhat made things worse for me was her adoption of European clothes since\ncoming to this place: I believe that, in her adroit way, she herself\nmade some of her dresses, for one day I saw in her apartments a number\nof coloured fashion-plates, with a confusion like dress-making; or she\nmay have been only modifying finished things from the shops, for her\nWestern dressing is not quite like what I remember of the modern female\nstyle, but is really, I should say, quite her own, rather resembling the\nGreek, or the eighteenth century. At any rate, the airs and graces are\nas natural to her as feathers to parrots; and she has changes like the\nmoon; never twice the same, and always transcending her last phase and\nrevelation: for I could not have conceived of anyone in whom _taste_ was\na faculty so separate as in her, so positive and salient, like smelling\nor sight--more like _smelling_: for it is the faculty, half Reason, half\nImagination, by which she fore-scents precisely what will suit\nexquisitely with what; so that every time I saw her, I received the\nimpression of a perfectly novel, completely bewitching, work of Art: the\nspecial quality of works of Art being to produce the momentary\nconviction that anything else whatever could not possibly be so good.\n\nOccasionally, from my window I would see her in the wood beyond the\ndrawbridge, cool and white in green shade, with her Bible probably,\ntraining her skirt like a court-lady, and looking much taller than\nbefore. I believe that this new dressing produced a separation between\nus more complete than it might have been; and especially after that day\nbetween Vevay and Ouchy I was very careful not to meet her. The more I\nsaw that she bejewelled herself, powdered herself, embalmed herself like\nsachets of sweet scents, chapleted her Greek-dressed head with gold\nfillets, the more I shunned her. Myself, somehow, had now resumed\nEuropean dress, and, ah me, I was greatly changed, greatly changed, God\nknows, from the portly inflated monarch-creature that strutted and\ngroaned four years previously in the palace at Imbros: so that my manner\nof life and thought might once more now have been called modern and\nWestern.\n\nAll the more was my sense of responsibility awful: and from day to day\nit seemed to intensify. An arguing Voice never ceased to remonstrate\nwithin me, nor left me peace, and the curse of unborn hosts appeared to\nmenace me. To strengthen my fixity I would often overwhelm myself, and\nher, with muttered opprobriums, calling myself \'convict,\' her\n\'lady-bird\'; asking what manner of man was I that I should dare so great\na thing; and as for her, what was she to be the Mother of a world?--a\nversatile butterfly with a woman\'s brow! And continually now in my\nfiercer moods I was meditating either my death--or hers.\n\nAh, but the butterfly did not let me forget her brow! To the south-west\nof Villeneuve, between the forest and the river is a well-grown gentian\nfield, and returning from round St. Gingolph to the ChÃ¢teau one day in\nthe third month after an absence of three days, I saw, as I turned a\ncorner in the descent of the mountain, some object floating in the air\nabove the field. Never was I more startled, and, above all, perplexed:\nfor, beside the object soaring there like a great butterfly, I could see\nnothing to account for it. It was not long, however, before I came to\nthe conclusion that she has re-invented _the kite_--for she had almost\ncertainly never seen one--and I presently sighted her holding the string\nin the midfield. Her invention resembles the kind called \'swallow-tail\'\nof old.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut mostly it was on the lake that I saw her, for there we chiefly\nlived, and occasionally there were guilty approaches and _rencontres_,\nshe in her boat, I in mine, both being slight clinker-built Montreux\npleasure-boats, which I had spent some days in overhauling and\nvarnishing, mine with jib, fore-and-aft mainsail, and spanker, hers\nrather smaller, one-masted, with an easy-running lug-sail. It was no\nuncommon thing for me to sail quite to Geneva, and come back from a\nseven-days\' cruise with my soul filled and consoled with the lake and\nall its many moods of bright and darksome, serene and pensive, dolorous\nand despairing and tragic, at morning, at noon, at sunset, at midnight,\na panorama that never for an instant ceased to unroll its\ntransformations, I sometimes climbing the mountains as high as the\ngoat-herd region of hoch-alpen, once sleeping there. And once I was made\nvery ill by a two-weeks\' horror which I had: for she disappeared in her\nskiff, I being at the ChÃ¢teau, and she did not come back; and while she\nwas away there was a tempest that turned the lake into an angry ocean,\nand, ah my good God, she did not come. At last, half-crazy at the vacant\ndays of misery which went by and by, and she did not come, I set out\nupon a wild-goose quest, of her--of all the hopeless things the most\nhopeless, for the world is great--and I sought and did not find her; and\nafter three days I turned back, recognising that I was mad to search the\ninfinite, and coming near the ChÃ¢teau, I saw her wave her handkerchief\nfrom the island-edge, for she divined that I had gone to seek her, and\nshe was watching for me: and when I took her hand, what did she say to\nme, the Biblical simpleton?--\'Oh you of little Faith!\' says she. And she\nhad adventures to lisp, with all the _r_\'s liquefied into _l_\'s, and I\nwas with her all that day again.\n\nOnce a month perhaps she would knock at my outermost door, which I\nmostly kept locked when at home, bringing me a sumptuously-dressed,\nhighly-spiced red trout or grayling, which I had not the heart to\nrefuse, and exquisitely she does them, all hot and spiced, applying\napparently to their preparation the taste which she applies to dress;\nand her extraordinary luck in angling did not fail to supply her with\nthe finest specimens, though, for that matter, this lake, with its old\nfish-hatcheries and fish-ladders, is not miserly in that way, swarming\nnow with the best lake trout, river trout, red trout, and with salmon,\nof which last I have brought in one with the landing-net of, I should\nsay, thirty-five to forty pounds. As the bottom goes off very rapidly\nfrom the two islands to a depth of eight to nine hundred feet, we did\nnot long confine ourselves to bottom-fishing, but gradually advanced to\nevery variety of manoeuvre, doing middle-water spinning with\nthree-triangle flights and sliding lip-hook for jack and trout, trailing\nwith the sail for salmon, live-baiting with the float for pike, daping\nwith blue-bottles, casting with artificial flies, and I could not say in\nwhich she became the most carelessly adept, for all soon seemed as old\nand natural to her as an occupation learned from birth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 21st October I attained my forty-sixth birthday in excellent\nhealth: a day destined to end for me in bloodshed and tragedy, alas. I\nforget now what circumstance had caused me to mention the date long\nbeforehand in, I think, Venice, not dreaming that she would keep any\ncount of it, nor was I even sure that my calendar was not faulty by a\nday. But at ten in the morning of what I called the 21st, descending by\nmy private spiral in flannels with some trout and par bait, and\ntackle--I met her coming up, my God, though she had no earthly right to\nbe there. With her cooing murmur of a laugh, yet pale, pale, and with a\nmost guilty look, she presented me a large bouquet of wild flowers.\n\nI was at once thrown into a state of great agitation. She was dressed in\nrather a frippery of _mousseline de soie_, all cream-laced, with\nwide-hanging short sleeves, a large diamond at the low open neck, the\nivory-brown skin there contrasting with the powdered bluish-white of her\nface, where, however, the freckles were not quite whited out; on her\nfeet little pink satin slippers, without any stockings--a divinely pale\npink; and well back on her hair a plain thin circlet of gold; and she\nsmelled like heaven, God knows.\n\nI could not speak. She broke an awkward silence, saying, very faint and\npallid:\n\n\'It is the day!\'\n\n\'I--perhaps--\' I said, or some incoherency like that.\n\nI saw the touch of enthusiasm which she had summoned up quenched by my\nmanner.\n\n\'I have not done long again?\' she asked, looking down, breaking another\nsilence.\n\n\'No, no, oh no,\' said I hurriedly: \'not done wrong again. Only, I could\nnot suppose that you would count up the days. You are ... considerate.\nPerhaps--but--\'\n\n\'Tell Leda?\'\n\n\'Perhaps.... I was going to say ... you might come fishing with me....\'\n\n\'O luck!\' she went softly.\n\nI was pierced by a sense of my base cowardice, my incredible weakness:\nbut I could not at all help it.\n\nI took the flowers, and we went down to the south side, where my boat\nlay; I threw out some of the fish from the well; arranged the tackle,\nand then the stern cushions for her; got up the sails; and out we went,\nshe steering, I in the bows, with every possible inch of space between\nus, receiving delicious intermittent whiffs from her of ambergris,\nfrangipane, or some blending of perfumes, the morning being bright and\nhot, with very little breeze on the water, which looked mottled, like\ncolourless water imperfectly mixed with indigo-wash, we making little\nheadway; so it was some time before I moved nearer her to get the par\nfor fixing on the three-triangle flight, for I was going to trail for\nsalmon or large lake-trout; and during all that time we spoke not a word\ntogether.\n\nAfterwards I said:\n\n\'Who told you that flowers are proper to birthdays? or that birthdays\nare of any importance?\'\n\n\'I suppose that nothing can happen so important as birth,\' says she:\n\'and perfumes must be ploper to birth, because the wise men blought\nspices to the young Jesus.\'\n\nThis _naÃ¯vetÃ©_ was the cause of my immediate recovery: for to laugh is\nto be saved: and I laughed right out, saying:\n\n\'But you read the Bible too much! all your notions are biblical. You\nshould read the quite modern books.\'\n\n\'I have tlied,\' says she: \'but I cannot lead them long, nor often. The\nwhole world seems to have got so collupted. It makes me shudder.\'\n\n\'Ah, well now, you see, you quite come round to my point of view,\' said\nI.\n\n\'Yes, and no,\' says she: \'they had got so _spoiled_, that is all.\nEverlybody seems to have become quite dull-witted--the plainest tluths\nthey could not see. I can imagine that those faculties which aided them\nin their stlain to become lich themselves, and make the lest more poor,\nmust have been gleatly sharpened, while all the other faculties\nwithered: as I can imagine a person with one eye seeing double thlough\nit, and quite blind on the other side.\'\n\n\'Ah,\' said I, \'I do not think they even _wanted_ to see on the other\nside. There were some few tolerably good and clear-sighted ones among\nthem, you know: and these all agreed in pointing out how, by changing\none or two of their old man-in-the-moon Bedlam arrangements, they could\ngreatly better themselves: but they heard with listless ears: I don\'t\nknow that they ever made any considerable effort. For they had become\nmore or less unconscious of their misery, so miserable were they: like\nthe man in Byron\'s ""Prisoner of Chillon,"" who, when his deliverers came,\nwas quite indifferent, for he says:\n\n  ""It was at length the same to me\n  Fettered or fetterless to be:\n    I had learned to love Despair.""\'\n\n\'Oh my God,\' she went, covering her face a moment, \'how dleadful! And\nit is tlue, it seems tlue:--they had learned to love Despair, to be even\nploud of Despair. Yet all the time, I feel _sure_ flom what I have lead,\nflom what I scent, that the individual man was stluggling to see, to\nlive light, but without power, like one\'s leg when it is asleep: that is\nso pletty of them all! that they meant well--everly one. But they were\ntoo tloubled and sad, too awfully burdened: they had no chance at all.\nSuch a queer, unnatulal feeling it gives me to lead of all that world: I\ncan\'t desclibe it; all their motives seem so tainted, their life so\nlopsided. Tluely, the whole head was sick, and the whole heart faint.\'\n\n\'Quite so,\' said I: \'and observe that this was no new thing: in the very\nbeginning of the Book we read how God saw that the wickedness of man was\ngreat on the earth, and every imagination of his heart evil....\'\n\n\'Yes,\' she interrupted, \'that is tlue: but there must have been some\n_cause!_ We can be quite _sure_ that it was not natulal, because you and\nI are men, and our hearts are not evil.\'\n\nThis was her great argument which she always trotted out, because she\nfound that I had usually no answer to give to it. But this time I said:\n\n\'Our hearts not evil? Say yours: but as to mine you know nothing,\nLeda.\'\n\nThe semicircles under her eyes had that morning, as often, a certain\nmoist, heavy, pensive and weary something, as of one fresh from a revel,\nvery sweet and tender: and, looking softly at me with it, she answered:\n\n\'I know my own heart, and it is not evil: not at all: not even in the\nvery least: and I know yours, too.\'\n\n\'You know _mine!_\' cried I, with a half-laugh of surprise.\n\n\'Quite well,\' says she.\n\nI was so troubled by this cool assurance, that I said not a word, but\ngoing to her, handed her the baited flight, swivel-trace, and line,\nwhich she paid out; then I got back again almost into the bows.\n\nAfter a ten-minutes I spoke again:\n\n\'So this is news to me: you know all about my heart. Well, come, tell me\nwhat is in it!\'\n\nNow she was silent, pretending to be busy with the trail, till she said,\nspeaking with low-bent face, and a voice that I could only just hear:\n\n\'I will tell you what is in it: in it is a lebellion which you think\ngood, but is not good. If a stleam will just flow, neither tlying to\nclimb upward, nor over-flowing its banks, but lunning modestly in its\nfated channel just wherever it is led, then it will finally leach the\nsea--the mighty ocean--and lose itself in fulness.\'\n\n\'Ah,\' said I, \'but that counsel is not new. It is what the philosophers\nused to call ""yielding to Destiny,"" and ""following Nature."" And Destiny\nand Nature, I give you my word, often led mankind quite wrong--\'\n\n\'Or _seemed_ to,\' says she--\'for a time: as when a stleam flows north a\nlittle, and the sea is to the south: but it is bound for the sea all the\ntime, and will turn again. Destiny never could, and cannot yet, be\njudged, for it is not finished: and our lace should follow blindly\nwhither it points, sure that thlough many curves it leads the world to\nour God.\'\n\n\'Our God indeed!\' I cried, getting very excited: \'girl! you talk\nspeciously, but falsely! whence have you these thoughts in that head of\nyours? Girl! you talk of ""our race""! But there are only two of us left?\nAre you talking _at_ me, Leda? Do not _I_ follow Destiny?\'\n\n\'You?\' she sighed, with down-bent face: \'ah, poor me!\'\n\n\'What should I do if I followed it?\' said I, with a crazy curiosity.\n\nHer face hung lower, paler, in trouble: and she said:\n\n\'You would come now and sit near me here. You would not be there where\nyou are. You would be always and for ever near me....\'\n\nMy good God! I felt my face redden.\n\n\'Oh, I could not _tell_ you...!\' I cried: \'you talk the most disastrous...!\nyou lack all responsibility...! Never, never...!\'\n\nHer face now was covered with her left hand, her right on the tiller:\nand bitingly she said, with a touch of venom:\n\n\'I could _make_ you come--_now_, if I chose: but I will not: I will wait\nupon my God....\'\n\n\'_Make_ me!\' I cried: \'Leda! How make me?\'\n\n\'I could cly before you, as I cly often and often ... in seclet ... for\nmy childlen....\'\n\n\'_You_ cry in secret? This is news--\'\n\n\'Yes, yes, I cly. Is not the burden of the world heavy upon me, too? and\nthe work I have to do _vely, vely_ gleat? And often and often I cly in\nseclet, thinking of it: and I could cly now if I chose, for you love\nyour little girl so much, that you could not lesist me one minute....\'\n\nNow I saw the push and tortion and trembling of her poor little\nunder-lip, boding tears: and at once a flame was in me which was\naltogether beyond control; and crying out: \'why, my poor dear,\' I found\nmyself in the act of rushing through the staggering boat to take her to\nme.\n\nMid-way, however, I was saved: a whisper, intense as lightning, arrested\nme: \'Forward is no escape, nor backward, but _sideward_ there may be a\nway!\' And at a sudden impulse, before I knew what I was doing, I was in\nthe water swimming.\n\nThe smaller of the islands was two hundred yards away, and thither I\nswam, rested some minutes, and thence to the Castle. I did not once look\nbehind me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, from 11 A.M. till five in the afternoon, I thought it all out,\nlying in the damp flannels on my face on the sofa in the recess beside\nmy bed, where it was quite dark behind the tattered piece of arras: and\nwhat things I suffered that day, and what deeps I sounded, and what\nprayers I prayed, God knows. What infinitely complicated the awful\nproblem was this thought in my head: that to kill her would be far more\nmerciful to her than to leave her alone, having killed myself: and,\nHeaven knows, it was for her alone that I thought, not at all caring for\nmyself. To kill her was better: but to kill her with my own hands--that\nwas too hard to expect of a poor devil like me, a poor common son of\nAdam, after all, and never any sublime self-immolator, as two or three\nof them were. And hours I lay there with brows convulsed in an agony,\ngroaning only those words: \'To kill her! to kill her!\' thinking\nsometimes that I should be merciful to myself too, and die, and let her\nlive, and not care, since, after my death, I would not see her suffer,\nfor the dead know not anything: and to expect me to kill her with my own\nhand was a little too much. Yet that one or other of us must die was\nperfectly certain, for I knew that I was just on the brink of failing in\nmy oath, and matters here had reached an obvious crisis: unless we could\nmake up our minds to part...? putting the width of the earth between\nus? That conception occurred to me: and in the turmoil of my thoughts it\nseemed a possibility. Finally, about 5 P.M., I resolved upon something:\nand first I leapt up, went down and across the house into the arsenal,\nchose a small revolver, fitted it with cartridge, took it up-stairs,\nlubricated it with lamp-oil, went down and out across the drawbridge,\nwalked two miles beyond the village, shot the revolver at a tree, found\nits action accurate, and started back. When I came to the Castle, I\nwalked along the island to the outer end, and looked up: there were her\npretty cream Valenciennes, put up by herself, waving inward before the\nlight lake-breeze at one open oriel; and I knew that she was in the\nCastle, for I felt it: and always, always, when she was within, I knew,\nfor I felt her with me; and always when she was away, I knew, I felt,\nfor the air had a dreadful drought, and a barrenness, in it. And I\nlooked up for a time to see if she would come to the window, and then I\ncalled, and she appeared. And I said to her: \'Come down here.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust here there is a little rock-path to the south, going down to the\nwater between rocks mixed with shrub-like little trees, three yards\nlong: a path, or a lane, one might call it, for at the lower end the\nrocks and trees reach well over a tall man\'s head. There she had tied my\nboat to a slender linden-trunk: and sadder now than Gethsemane that\nfamiliar boat seemed to my eyes, for I knew very well that I should\nnever enter it more. I walked up and down the path, awaiting her: and\nfrom the jacket-pocket in which lay the revolver I drew a box of Swedish\nmatches, from it took two matches, and broke off a bit from the plain\nend of one; and the two I held between my left thumb and forefinger\njoint, the phosphorus ends level and visible, the other ends invisible:\nand I awaited her, pacing fast, and my brow was as stern as Azrael and\nRhadamanthus.\n\nShe came, very pale, poor thing, and flurried, breathing fast. And\n\'Leda,\' I said, meeting her in the middle of the lane, and going\nstraight to the point, \'we are to part, as you guess--for ever, as you\nguess--for I see very well by your face that you guess. I, too, am very\nsorry, my little child, and heavy is my heart. To leave you ... alone\n... in the world ... is--death for me. But it must, ah it must, be\ndone.\'\n\nHer face suddenly turned as sallow as the dead were, when the shroud was\nalready on, and the coffin had become a stale added piece of\nroom-furniture by the bed-side; but in recording that fact, I record\nalso this other: that, accompanying this mortal sallowness, which\npainfully shewed up her poor freckles, was a steady smile, a little\nturned-down: a smile of steady, of slightly disdainful--Confidence.\n\nShe did not say anything: so I went on.\n\n\'I have thought long,\' said I, \'and I have made a plan--a plan which\ncannot be effective without _your_ consent and co-operation: and the\nplan is this: we go from this place together--this same night--to some\nunknown spot, some town, say a hundred miles hence--by train. There I\nget two motors, and I in one, and you in the other, we separate, going\ndifferent ways. We shall thus never be able, however much we may want\nto, to rediscover each other in all this wide world. That is my plan.\'\n\nShe looked me in the face, smiling her smile: and the answer was not\nlong in coming.\n\n\'I will go in the tlain with you,\' says she with slow decisiveness: \'but\nwhere you leave me, there I will stay, till I die; and I will patiently\nwait till my God convert you, and send you back to me.\'\n\n\'That means that you refuse to do what I say?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said she, bowing the head with great dignity.\n\n\'Well, you speak, not like a girl, Leda,\' said I, \'but like a full woman\nnow. But still, reflect a minute.... O reflect! If you stayed where I\nleft you, I _should_ go back to you, and pretty soon, too: I know that I\nshould. Tell me, then--reflect well, and tell me--do you definitely\nrefuse to part with me?\'\n\nThe answer was pretty prompt, cool, and firm:\n\n\'Yes; I lefuse.\'\n\nI left her then, took a turn down the path, and came back.\n\n\'Then,\' said I, \'here are two matches in my grasp: be good enough to\ndraw one.\'\n\n_Now_ she was hit to the heart: I saw her eyes widen to the width of\nhorror, with a glassy stare: she had read of the drawing of lots in the\nBible: she knew that it meant death for me, or for her.\n\nBut she obeyed without a word, after one backward start and then a brief\nhovering in decision of thumb and forefinger over my held-out hand. I\nhad fixed it in my mind that if she drew the shorter of the matches,\nthen she should die; if the longer, then I should die.\n\nShe drew the shorter....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was only what I should have expected: for I knew that God loved\nher, and hated me.\n\nBut instantly upon the first shock of the enormity that I should be her\nexecutioner, I made my resolve: to drop shot, too, at the moment after\nshe dropped shot, so disposing my body, that it would fall half upon\nher, and half by her, so that we might be close always: and that would\nnot be so bad, after all.\n\nWith a sudden movement I snatched the revolver from my pocket: she did\nnot move, except her white lips, which, I think, whispered:\n\n\'_Not yet_....\'\n\nI stood with hanging arm, forefinger on trigger, looking at her. I saw\nher glance once at the weapon, and then she fixed her eyes upwards upon\nmy face: and now that same smile, which had disappeared, was on her lips\nagain, meaning confidence, meaning disdain.\n\nI waited for her to open her mouth to say something--to stop that\nsmile--that I might shoot her quick and sudden: and she would not,\nknowing that I could not kill her while she was smiling; and suddenly,\nall my pity and love for her changed into a strange resentment and rage\nagainst her, for she was purposely making hard for me what I was doing\nfor her sake: and the bitter thought was in my mind: \'You are nothing to\nme: if you want to die, you do your own killing; and I will do my own\nkilling.\' And without one word to her, I strode away, and left her\nthere.\n\nI see now that this whole drawing of lots was nothing more than a farce:\nI never could have killed her, smiling, or no smiling: for to each thing\nand man is given a certain strength: and a thing cannot be stronger than\nits strength, strive as it may: it is so strong, and no stronger, and\nthere is an end of the matter.\n\nI walked up to the Grand Bailli\'s _bureau_, a room about twenty-five\nfeet from the ground. By this time it was getting pretty dark, but I\ncould see, by peering, the face of a grandfather\'s-clock which I had\nlong since set going, and kept wound. It is on the north side of the\nroom, over the writing-desk opposite the oriels. It then pointed to\nhalf-past six, and in order to fix some definite moment for the bitter\neffort of the mortal act, I said: \'At Seven.\' I then locked the door\nwhich opens upon three little steps near the desk, and also the\nstair-door; and I began to pace the chamber. There was not a breath of\nair here, and I was hot; I seemed to be stifling, tore open my shirt at\nthe throat, and opened the lower half of the central mullion-space of\none oriel. Some minutes later, at twenty-five to seven, I lit two\ncandles on the desk, and sat to write to her, the pistol at my right\nhand; but I had hardly begun, when I thought that I heard a sound at the\nthree-step door, which was only four feet to my left: a sound which\nresembled a scraping of her slipper; I stole to the door, and crouched,\nlistening: but I could hear nothing further. I then returned to the\ndesk, and set to writing, giving her some last directions for her life,\ntelling her why I died, how I loved her, much better than my own soul,\nbegging her to love me always, and to live on to please me, but if she\n_would_ die, then to be sure to die near me. Tears were pouring down my\nface, when, turning, I saw her standing in a terrified pose hardly two\nfeet behind me. The absolute stealth which had brought and put her\nthere, unknown to me, was like miracle: for the ladder, whose top I saw\nintruding into the open oriel, I knew well, having often seen it in a\nroom below, and its length was quite thirty feet, nor could its weight\nbe trifling: yet I had heard not one hint of its impact upon the window.\nBut there, at all events, she was, wan as a ghost.\n\nImmediately, as my consciousness realised her, my hand instinctively\nwent out to secure the weapon: but she darted upon it, and was an\ninstant before me. I flew after her to wrench it away, but she flew,\ntoo: and before I caught her, had thrown it cleanly through two rungs of\nthe ladder and the window. I dashed to the window, and after a hurried\npeer thought that I saw it below at the foot of a rock; away I flew to\nthe stair-door, wrung open the lock, and down the stairs, three at a\ntime, I ran to recover it. I remember being rather surprised that she\ndid not follow, forgetting all about the ladder.\n\nBut with a horrid shock I was reminded of it the moment I reached the\nbottom, before ever I had passed from the house: for I heard the report\nof the weapon--that crack, my God! and crying out: \'Well, Lord, she has\ndied for me, then!\' I tottered forward, and tumbled upon her, where she\nlay under the incline of the ladder in her blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night! what a night it was! of fingers shivering with haste, of\nharum-scarum quests and searches, of groans, and piteous appeals to God.\nFor there were no surgical instruments, lint, anaesthetics, nor\nantiseptics that I knew of in the ChÃ¢teau; and though I knew of a house\nin Montreux where I could find them, the distance was quite infinite,\nand the time an eternity in which to leave her all alone, bleeding to\ndeath; and, to my horror, I remembered that there was barely enough\npetrol in the motor, and the store usually kept in the house exhausted.\nHowever, I did it, leaving her there unconscious on her bed: but _how_ I\ndid it, and lived sane afterwards, that is another matter.\n\nIf I had not been a medical man, she must, I think, have died: for the\nbullet had broken the left fifth rib, had been deflected, and I found\nit buried in the upper part of the abdominal wall. I did not go from her\nbed-side: I did not sleep, though I nodded and staggered: for all things\nwere nothing to me, but her: and for a frightfully long time she\nremained comatose. While she was still in this state I took her to a\nchalet beyond Villeneuve, three miles away on the mountain-side, a\nhomely, but very salubrious place which I knew, imbedded in verdures,\nfor I was desperate at her long collapse, and had hope in the higher\nair. And there after three more days, she opened her eyes, and smiled\nwith me.\n\nIt was then that I said to myself: \'This is the noblest, sagest, and\nalso the most loveable, of the creatures whom God has made in heaven or\nearth. She has won my life, and I will live.... But at least, to save\nmyself, I will put the broadest Ocean that there is between her and me:\nfor I wish to be a decent being, for the honour of my race, being the\nlast, and to turn out trumps ... though I do love my dear, God\nknows....\'\n\nAnd thus, after only fifty-five days at the chalet, were we forced still\nfurther Westward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wished her to remain at Chillon, intending, myself, to start for the\nAmericas, whence any sudden impulse to return to her could not be\neasily accomplished: but she refused, saying that she would come with me\nto the coast of France: and I could not say her no.\n\nAnd at the coast, after thirteen days we arrived, three days before the\nNew Year, traversing France by steam, air, and petrol traction.\n\nWe came to Havre--infirm, infirm of will that I was: for in my deep\nheart was the secret, hidden away from my own upper self, that, she\nbeing at Havre, and I at Portsmouth, we could still speak together.\n\nWe came humming into the dark town of Havre in a four-seat motor-car\nabout ten in the evening of the 29th December: a raw bleak night, she,\nit was clear, poor thing, bitterly cramped with cold. I had some\nrecollection of the place, for I had been there, and drove to the quays,\nnear which I stopped at the _Maire\'s_ large house, a palatial place\noverlooking the sea, in which she slept, I occupying another near.\n\nThe next morning I was early astir, searched in the _mairie_ for a map\nof the town, where I also found a _Bottin_: I could thus locate the\nTelephone Exchange. In the _Maire\'s_ house, which I had fixed upon to be\nher home, the telephone was set up in an alcove adjoining a very stately\n_salon_ Louis Quinze; and though I knew that these little dry batteries\nwould not be run down in twenty odd years, yet, fearing any weakness, I\nbroke open the box, and substituted a new one from the Company\'s stores\ntwo streets away, at the same time noting the exchange-number of the\ninstrument. This done, I went down among the ships by the wharves, and\nfixed upon the first old green air-boat that seemed fairly sound, broke\nopen a near shop, procured some buckets of oil, and by three o\'clock had\ntested and prepared my ship. It was a dull and mournful day, drizzling,\nchilly. I returned then to the _mairie_, where for the first time I saw\nher, and she was heavy of heart that day: but when I broke the news that\nshe would be able to speak to me, every day, all day, first she was all\nincredulous astonishment, then, for a moment, her eyes turned white to\nHeaven, then she was skipping like a kid. We were together three\nprecious hours, examining the place, and returning with stores of\nwhatever she might require, till I saw darkness coming on, and we went\ndown to the ship.\n\nAnd when those long-dead screws awoke and moved, bearing me toward the\nOuter Basin, I saw her stand darkling, lonely, on the Quai through\nheart-rending murk and drizzly inclemency: and oh my God, the gloomy\nunder-look of those red eyes, and the piteous out-push of that little\nlip, and the hurried burying of that face! My heart broke, for I had not\ngiven her even one little, last kiss, and she had been so good, quietly\nacquiescing, like a good wife, not attempting to force her presence upon\nme in the ship; and I left her there, all widowed, alone on the\nContinent of Europe, watching after me: and I went out to the bleak and\ndreary fields of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArriving at Portsmouth the next morning, I made my residence in the\nfirst house in which I found an instrument, a spacious dwelling facing\nthe Harbour Pier. I then hurried round to the Exchange, which is on the\nHard near the Docks, a large red building with facings of Cornish\nmoor-stone, a bank on the ground-floor, and the Exchange on the first.\nHere I plugged her number on to mine, ran back, rang--and, to my great\nthanksgiving, heard her speak. (This instrument, however, did not prove\nsatisfactory: I broke the box, and put in another battery, and still the\nvoice was muffled: finally, I furnished the middle room at the Exchange\nwith a truckle-bed, stores, and a few things, and here have taken up\nresidence.)\n\nI believe that she lives and sleeps under the instrument, as I here\nlive and sleep, sleep and live, under it. My instrument is quite near\none of the harbour-windows, so that, hearing her, I can gaze out toward\nher over the expanse of waters, yet see her not; and she, too, looking\nover the sea toward me, can hear a voice from the azure depths of\nnowhere, yet see me not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI this morning early to her:\n\n\'Good morning! Are you there?\'\n\n\'Good morning! No: I am there,\' says she.\n\n\'Well, that was what I asked--""are you there""?\'\n\n\'But I not here, I am there,\' says she.\n\n\'I know very well that you are not ""here,""\' said I, \'for I do not see\nyou: but I asked if you were there, and you say ""No,"" and then ""Yes.""\'\n\n\'It is the paladox of the heart,\' says she.\n\n\'The what?\'\n\n\'The paladox,\' says she.\n\n\'But still I do not understand: how can you be both there and not\nthere?\'\n\n\'If my ear is here, and I elsewhere?\' says she.\n\n\'An operation?\'\n\n\'Yes!\' says she.\n\n\'What doctor?\'\n\n\'A specialist!\' says she.\n\n\'An ear-specialist?\'\n\n\'A heart!\' says she.\n\n\'And you let a heart-specialist operate on your ear?\'\n\n\'On myself he operlated, and left the ear behind!\' says she.\n\n\'Well, and how are you after it?\'\n\n\'Fairly well. Are you?\' says she.\n\n\'Quite well. Did you sleep well?\'\n\n\'Except when you lang me up at midnight. I have had such a dleam ...\'\n\n\'What?\'\n\n\'I dleamed that I saw two little boys of the same age--only I could not\nsee their faces, I never can see anybody\'s face, only yours and mine,\nmine and yours always--of the same age--playing in a wood....\'\n\n\'Ah, I hope that one of them was not called Cain, my poor girl.\'\n\n\'Not at all! neither of them! Suppose I tell a stoly, and say that one\nwas called Caius and the other Tibelius, or one John and the other\nJesus?\'\n\n\'Ah. Well, tell me the _dleam_....\'\n\n\'Now you do not deserve.\'\n\n\'Well, what will you do to-day?\'\n\n\'I? It is a lovely day ... have you nice weather in England?\'\n\n\'Very.\'\n\n\'Well, between eleven and twelve I will go out and gather Spling-flowers\nin the park, and cover the salon deep, deep. Wouldn\'t you like to be\nhere?\'\n\n\'Not I.\'\n\n\'You would!\'\n\n\'Why should I? I prefer England.\'\n\n\'But Flance is nice too: and Flance wants to be fliends with England,\nand is waiting, oh waiting, for England to come over, and be fliends.\nCouldn\'t some _lapplochement_ be negotiated?\'\n\n\'Good-bye. This talking spoils my morning smoke....\'\n\nSo we speak together across the sea, my God.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning of the 8th April, when I had been separated thirteen\nweeks from her, I boarded several ships in the Inner Port, a lunacy in\nmy heart, and selected what looked like a very swift boat, one of the\nsmaller Atlantic air-steamers called the _Stettin_, which seemed to\nrequire the least labour in oiling, &c., in order to fit her for the\nsea: for the boat in which I had come to England was a mere tub, though\nsound, and I pined for the wings of a dove, that I might fly away to\nher, and be at rest.\n\nI toiled with fluttering hands that day, and I believe that I was of the\ncolour of ashes to my very lips. By half-past two o\'clock I was\nfinished, and by three was coasting down Southampton Water by Netley\nHospital and the Hamble-mouth, having said not one word about anything\nat the telephone, or even to my own guilty heart not a word. But in the\nsilent depths of my being I felt this fact: that this must be a 35-knot\nboat, and that, if driven hard, hard, in spite of the heavy garment of\nseaweed which she trailed, she would do 30; also that Havre was 120\nmiles away, and at 7 P.M. I should be on its quay.\n\nAnd when I was away, and out on the bright and breezy sea, I called to\nher, crying out: \'_I am coming!_\' And I knew that she heard me, and that\nher heart leapt to meet me, for mine leapt, too, and felt her answering.\n\nThe sun went down: it set. I was tired of the day\'s work, and of\nstanding at the high-set wheel; and I could not yet see the coast of\nFrance. And a thought smote me, and after another ten minutes I turned\nthe ship\'s head back, my face screwed with pain, God knows, like a man\nwhose thumbs are ground between the screws, and his body drawn out and\nout on the rack to tenuous length, and his flesh massacred with pincers:\nand I fell upon the floor of the bridge contorted with anguish: for I\ncould not go to her. But after a time that paroxysm passed, and I rose\nup sullen and resentful, and resumed my place at the wheel, steering\nback for England: for a fixed resolve was in my breast, and I said: \'Oh\nno, no more. If I could bear it, I would, I would ... but if it is\nimpossible, how can I? To-morrow night as the sun sets--without fail--so\nhelp me God--I will kill myself.\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo it is finished, my good God.\n\nOn the early morning of the next day, the 9th, I having come back to\nPortsmouth about eleven the previous night, when I bid her \'Good\nmorning\' through the telephone, she said \'Good morning,\' and not another\nword. I said:\n\n\'I got my hookah-bowl broken last night, and shall be trying to mend it\nto-day.\'\n\nNo answer.\n\n\'Are you there?\' said I.\n\n\'Yes,\' says she.\n\n\'Then why don\'t you answer?\' said I.\n\n\'Where were you all yesterday?\' says she.\n\n\'I went for a little cruise in the basin,\' said I.\n\nSilence for three minutes: then she says:\n\n\'What is the matter?\'\n\n\'Matter?\' said I, \'nothing!\'\n\n\'_Tell me!_\' she says--with such an intensity and rage, as to make me\nshudder.\n\n\'There is nothing to tell, Leda!\'\n\n\'Oh, but how can you be so _cluel_ to me?\' she cries, and ah, there was\nanguish in that voice! \'There is something to tell--there _is!_ Don\'t I\nknow it vely well by your voice?\'\n\nAh, the thought took me then, how, on the morrow, she would ring, and\nhave no answer; and she would ring again, and have no answer; and she\nwould ring all day, and ring, and ring; and for ever she would ring,\nwith white-flowing hair and the staring eye-balls of frenzy, battering\nreproaches at the doors of God, and the Universe would cry back to her\nhowls and ravings only one eternal answer of Silence, of Silence. And as\nI thought of that--for very pity, for very pity, my God--I could not\nhelp sobbing aloud:\n\n\'May God pity you, woman!\'\n\nI do not know if she heard it: she _must_, I think, have heard: but no\nreply came; and there I, shivering like the sheeted dead, stood waiting\nfor her next word, waiting long, dreading, hoping for, her voice,\nthinking that if she spoke and sobbed but once, I should drop dead,\ndead, where I stood, or bite my tongue through, or shriek the high laugh\nof distraction. But when at last, after quite thirty or forty minutes\nshe spoke, her voice was perfectly firm and calm. She said:\n\n\'Are you there?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said I, \'yes, Leda.\'\n\n\'What was the color,\' says she, \'of the poison-cloud which destroyed the\nworld?\'\n\n\'Purple, Leda,\' said I.\n\n\'And it had a smell like almonds or peach blossoms, did it not?\' says\nshe.\n\n\'Yes,\' said I, \'yes.\'\n\n\'Then,\' says she, \'there is _another_ eruption. Every now and again I\nseem to scent strange whiffs like that ... and there is a purple vapour\nin the East which glows and glows ... just see if you can see it....\'\n\nI flew across the room to an east window, threw up the grimy sash, and\nlooked. But the view was barred by the plain brick back of a tall\nwarehouse. I rushed back, gasped to her to wait, rushed down the two\nstairs, and out upon the Hard. For a minute I ran dodging wildly about,\nseeking a purview to the East, and finally ran up the dockyard, behind\nthe storehouses to the Semaphore, and reached the top, panting for life.\nI looked abroad. The morning sky, but for a bank of cloud to the\nnorth-west, was cloudless, the sun blazing in a region of clear azure\npallor. And back again I flew.\n\n\'I cannot see it...!\' I cried.\n\n\'Then it has not tlavelled far enough to the north-west yet,\' she said\nwith decision.\n\n\'My wife!\' I cried: \'you are my wife now!\'\n\n\'Am I?\' says she: \'at last? Are you glad?... But shall I not soon die?\'\n\n\'No! You can escape! My home! My heart! If only for an hour or two, then\ndeath--just think, together--on the same couch, for ever, heart to\nheart--how sweet!\'\n\n\'Yes! how sweet! But how escape?\'\n\n\'It travelled slowly before. Get quick--will you?--into one of the\nsmaller boats by the quay--there is one just under the crane that is an\nair-boat--you have seen me turn on the air, haven\'t you?--that handle on\nthe right as you descend the steps under the dial-thing--get first a\nbucket of oil from the shop next to the clock-tower in the quay-street,\nand throw it over everything that you see rusted. Only, spend no\ntime--for me, my heaven! You can steer by the tiller and compass: well,\nthe wheel is quite the same, only just the opposite. First unmoor, then\nto the handle, then to the wheel. The course is directly North-East by\nNorth. I will meet you on the sea--go now--\'\n\nI was wild with bliss. I thought that I should take her between my arms,\nand have the little freckles against my face, and taste her short\nfirm-fleshed upper-lip, and moan upon her, and whimper upon her, and\nmutter upon her, and say \'My wife.\' And even when I knew that she was\ngone from the telephone, I still stood there, hoarsely calling after\nher: \'My wife! My wife!\'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flew down to where the steamer lay moored that had borne me the\nprevious day. Her joint speed with the speed of Leda\'s boat would be\nforty knots: in three hours we must meet. I had not the least fear of\nher dying before I saw her: for, apart from the deliberate movement of\nthe vapour that first time, I fore-tasted and trusted my love, that she\nwould surely come, and not fail: as dying saints fore-tasted and trusted\nEternal Life.\n\nI was no sooner on board the _Stettin_ than her engines were straining\nunder what was equivalent to forced draught. On the previous day it\nwould have little surprised me at any moment, while I drove her, to be\ncarried to the clouds in an explosion from her deep-rusted steel tanks:\nbut this day such a fear never crossed my mind: for I knew very well\nthat I was immortal till I saw her.\n\nThe sea was not only perfectly smooth, but placid, as on the previous\nday: only it seemed far placider, and the sun brighter, and there was a\nlevity in the breezes that frilled the sea in fugitive dark patches,\nlike _frissons_ of tickling; and I thought that the morning was a true\nmarriage-morning, and remembered that it was a Sabbath; and sweet odours\nour wedding would not lack of peach and almond, though, looking\neastward, I could see no faintest sign of any purple cloud, but only\nrags of chiffon under the sun; and it would be an eternal wedding, for\none day in our sight would be as a thousand years, and our thousand\nyears of bliss would be but one day, and in the evening of all that\neternity death would come and sweetly lay its finger upon our languid\nlids, and we should die of weary bliss; and all manner of dancings and\nsingings--fandango and light galliard, corantoes and the solemn\ngavotte--were a-tune in my heart that happy day; and running by the\nchart-house to the wheel, I saw under the table a great roll of old\nflags, and presently they were flying in a long curve of gala from the\nmain; and the sea rumpled in a long tract of tumbling milk behind me;\nand I hasted homeward, to meet my heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo purple cloud could I see as, on and on, for two hours, I tore\nsouthward: but at hot noon, on the weather beam I spied through the\nglass across the water something else which moved, and it was you who\ncame to me, Oh Leda, my spirit\'s breath!\n\nI bore down upon her, waving: and soon I saw her stand like an ancient\nmariner, but in white muslins that fluttered, at her wheel on the\nbridge--it was one of those little old Havre-Antwerp craft very high in\nthe bows--and she waved a little white thing. And we came nearer, till I\ncould spy her face, her smile, and I shouted her to stop, and in a\nminute stopped myself, and by happy steering came with slowing headway\nto a slight crash by her side, and ran down the trellised steps to her,\nand led her up; and on the deck, without saying a word, I fell to my\nknees before her, and I bowed my brow to the floor, with obeisance, and\nI worshipped her there as Heaven.\n\nAnd we were wedded: for she, too, bowed the knee with me under the\njovial blue sky; and under her eyes were the little moist semicircles of\ndreamy pensive fatigue, so dear and wifish: and God was there, and saw\nher kneel: for He loves the girl.\n\nAnd I got the two ships apart, and they rested there some yards divided\nall the day, and we were in the main-deck cabin, where I had locked a\ndoor, so that no one might come in to be with my love and me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said to her:\n\n\'We will fly west to one of the Somersetshire coal-mines, or to one of\nthe Cornwall tin-mines, and we will barricade ourselves against the\ncloud, and provision ourselves for six months--for it is perfectly\nfeasible, and we have plenty of time, and no crowds to break down our\nbarricades--and there in the deep earth we will live sweetly together,\ntill the danger is overpast.\'\n\nAnd she smiled, and drew her hand across my face, and said:\n\n\'No, no: don\'t you tlust in my God? do you think He would leally let me\ndie?\'\n\nFor she has appropriated the Almighty God to herself, naming Him \'_my_\nGod\'--the impudence: though she generally knows what she is saying, too.\nAnd she would not fly the cloud.\n\nAnd I am now writing three weeks later at a little place called\nChÃ¢teau-les-Roses, and no poison-cloud, and no sign of any poison-cloud,\nhas come. And this I do not understand.\n\nIt may be that she divined that I was about to destroy myself ... she\nmay be quite capable.... But no, I do not understand, and shall never\nask her.\n\nBut _this_ I understand: that it is _the White_ who is Master here: that\nthough he wins but by a hair, yet he wins, he wins: and since he wins,\ndance, dance, my heart.\n\nI look for a race that shall resemble its Mother: nimble-witted,\nlight-minded, pious--like her; all-human, ambidextrous, ambicephalous,\ntwo-eyed--like her; and if, like her, they talk the English language\nwith all the r\'s turned into l\'s, I shall not care.\n\nThey will be vegetable-eaters, I suppose, when all the meat now extant\nis eaten up: but it is not certain that meat is good for men: and if it\nis really good, then they will _invent_ a meat: for they will be _her_\nsons, and she, to the furthest cycle in which the female human mind is\npermitted to orbit, is, I swear, all-wise.\n\nThere was a preaching man--a Scotchman he was, named Macintosh, or\nsomething like that--who said that the last end of Man shall be well,\nand very well: and she says the same: and the agreement of these two\nmakes a Truth. And to that I now say: Amen, Amen.\n\nFor I, Adam Jeffson, second Parent of the world, hereby lay down,\nordain, and decree for all time, clearly perceiving it now: That the one\nMotto and Watch-word essentially proper to each human individual, and to\nthe whole Race of Man, as distinct from other races in heaven or in\nearth, was always, and remains, even this: \'Though He slay me, yet will\nI trust in Him.\'\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Purple Cloud, by M.P.

Louis Lambert, the only child of a tanner and his wife, is born in 1797 and begins reading at an early age. In 1811 he meets the real-life Swiss author Madame de Staël (1766–1817), who – struck by his intellect – pays for him to enroll in the Collège de Vendôme. There he meets the narrator, a classmate named ""the Poet"" who later identifies himself in the text as Balzac; they quickly become friends. Shunned by the other students and berated by teachers for not paying attention, the boys bond through discussions of philosophy and mysticism.\nAfter completing an essay entitled Traité de la Volonté (""Treatise on the Will""), Lambert is horrified when a teacher confiscates it, calls it ""rubbish"", and – the narrator speculates – sells it to a local grocer. Soon afterwards, a serious illness forces the narrator to leave the school. In 1815, Lambert graduates at the age of eighteen and lives for three years in Paris. After returning to his uncle\'s home in Blois, he meets a woman named Pauline de Villenoix and falls passionately in love with her. On the day before their wedding, however, he suffers a mental breakdown and attempts to castrate himself.\nDeclared ""incurable"" by doctors, Lambert is ordered into solitude and rest. Pauline takes him to her family\'s château, where he lives in a near coma. The narrator, ignorant of these events, meets Lambert\'s uncle by chance, and is given a series of letters. Written by Lambert while in Paris and Blois, they continue his philosophical musings and describe his love for Pauline. The narrator visits his old friend at the Villenoix château, where the decrepit Lambert says only: ""The angels are white."" Pauline shares a series of statements her lover had dictated, and Lambert dies on 25 September 1824 at the age of twenty-eight.', 'tokens': array(['The', 'novel', 'begins', 'with', 'an', 'overview', 'of', 'the',

For, indeed, the tanner and his wife\nadored Louis, their only child, and never contradicted him in anything.\n\nAt the age of five Louis had begun by reading the Old and New\nTestaments; and these two Books, including so many books, had sealed his\nfate. Could that childish imagination understand the mystical depths of\nthe Scriptures? Could it so early follow the flight of the Holy Spirit\nacross the worlds? Or was it merely attracted by the romantic touches\nwhich abound in those Oriental poems! Our narrative will answer these\nquestions to some readers.\n\nOne thing resulted from this first reading of the Bible: Louis went all\nover Montoire begging for books, and he obtained them by those winning\nways peculiar to children, which no one can resist. While devoting\nhimself to these studies under no sort of guidance, he reached the age\nof ten.\n\nAt that period substitutes for the army were scarce; rich families\nsecured them long beforehand to have them ready when the lots were\ndrawn. The poor tanner\'s modest fortune did not allow of their\npurchasing a substitute for their son, and they saw no means allowed by\nlaw for evading the conscription but that of making him a priest; so,\nin 1807, they sent him to his maternal uncle, the parish priest of Mer,\nanother small town on the Loire, not far from Blois. This arrangement at\nonce satisfied Louis\' passion for knowledge, and his parents\' wish not\nto expose him to the dreadful chances of war; and, indeed, his taste for\nstudy and precocious intelligence gave grounds for hoping that he might\nrise to high fortunes in the Church.\n\nAfter remaining for about three years with his uncle, an old and not\nuncultured Oratorian, Louis left him early in 1811 to enter the college\nat Vendome, where he was maintained at the cost of Madame de Stael.\n\nLambert owed the favor and patronage of this celebrated lady to chance,\nor shall we not say to Providence, who can smooth the path of forlorn\ngenius? To us, indeed, who do not see below the surface of human things,\nsuch vicissitudes, of which we find many examples in the lives of great\nmen, appear to be merely the result of physical phenomena; to most\nbiographers the head of a man of genius rises above the herd as\nsome noble plant in the fields attracts the eye of a botanist in\nits splendor. This comparison may well be applied to Louis Lambert\'s\nadventure; he was accustomed to spend the time allowed him by his uncle\nfor holidays at his father\'s house; but instead of indulging, after the\nmanner of schoolboys, in the sweets of the delightful _far niente_ that\ntempts us at every age, he set out every morning with part of a loaf\nand his books, and went to read and meditate in the woods, to escape\nhis mother\'s remonstrances, for she believed such persistent study to be\ninjurious. How admirable is a mother\'s instinct! From that time reading\nwas in Louis a sort of appetite which nothing could satisfy; he devoured\nbooks of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works,\nhistory, philosophy, and physics. He has told me that he found\nindescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books,\nand I readily believed him. What scholar has not many a time found\npleasure in seeking the probable meaning of some unknown word? The\nanalysis of a word, its physiognomy and history, would be to Lambert\nmatter for long dreaming. But these were not the instinctive dreams by\nwhich a boy accustoms himself to the phenomena of life, steels himself\nto every moral or physical perception--an involuntary education which\nsubsequently brings forth fruit both in the understanding and character\nof a man; no, Louis mastered the facts, and he accounted for them after\nseeking out both the principle and the end with the mother wit of a\nsavage. Indeed, from the age of fourteen, by one of those startling\nfreaks in which nature sometimes indulges, and which proved how\nanomalous was his temperament, he would utter quite simply ideas of\nwhich the depth was not revealed to me till a long time after.\n\n""Often,"" he has said to me when speaking of his studies, ""often have I\nmade the most delightful voyage, floating on a word down the abyss of\nthe past, like an insect embarked on a blade of grass tossing on the\nripples of a stream. Starting from Greece, I would get to Rome, and\ntraverse the whole extent of modern ages. What a fine book might\nbe written of the life and adventures of a word! It has, of course,\nreceived various stamps from the occasions on which it has served its\npurpose; it has conveyed different ideas in different places; but is it\nnot still grander to think of it under the three aspects of soul,\nbody, and motion? Merely to regard it in the abstract, apart from its\nfunctions, its effects, and its influence, is enough to cast one into\nan ocean of meditations? Are not most words colored by the idea they\nrepresent? Then, to whose genius are they due? If it takes great\nintelligence to create a word, how old may human speech be? The\ncombination of letters, their shapes, and the look they give to the\nword, are the exact reflection, in accordance with the character of each\nnation, of the unknown beings whose traces survive in us.\n\n""Who can philosophically explain the transition from sensation to\nthought, from thought to word, from the word to its hieroglyphic\npresentment, from hieroglyphics to the alphabet, from the alphabet to\nwritten language, of which the eloquent beauty resides in a series\nof images, classified by rhetoric, and forming, in a sense, the\nhieroglyphics of thought? Was it not the ancient mode of representing\nhuman ideas as embodied in the forms of animals that gave rise to the\nshapes of the first signs used in the East for writing down language?\nThen has it not left its traces by tradition on our modern languages,\nwhich have all seized some remnant of the primitive speech of nations,\na majestic and solemn tongue whose grandeur and solemnity decrease as\ncommunities grow old; whose sonorous tones ring in the Hebrew Bible,\nand still are noble in Greece, but grow weaker under the progress of\nsuccessive phases of civilization?\n\n""Is it to this time-honored spirit that we owe the mysteries lying\nburied in every human word? In the word _True_ do we not discern a\ncertain imaginary rectitude? Does not the compact brevity of its sound\nsuggest a vague image of chaste nudity and the simplicity of Truth in\nall things? The syllable seems to me singularly crisp and fresh.\n\n""I chose the formula of an abstract idea on purpose, not wishing to\nillustrate the case by a word which should make it too obvious to the\napprehension, as the word _Flight_ for instance, which is a direct\nappeal to the senses.\n\n""But is it not so with every root word? They are all stamped with a\nliving power that comes from the soul, and which they restore to the\nsoul through the mysterious and wonderful action and reaction between\nthought and speech. Might we not speak of it as a lover who finds on\nhis mistress\' lips as much love as he gives? Thus, by their mere\nphysiognomy, words call to life in our brain the beings which they\nserve to clothe. Like all beings, there is but one place where their\nproperties are at full liberty to act and develop. But the subject\ndemands a science to itself perhaps!""\n\nAnd he would shrug his shoulders as much as to say, ""But we are too high\nand too low!""\n\nLouis\' passion for reading had on the whole been very well satisfied.\nThe cure of Mer had two or three thousand volumes. This treasure had\nbeen derived from the plunder committed during the Revolution in the\nneighboring chateaux and abbeys. As a priest who had taken the oath,\nthe worthy man had been able to choose the best books from among these\nprecious libraries, which were sold by the pound. In three years Louis\nLambert had assimilated the contents of all the books in his uncle\'s\nlibrary that were worth reading. The process of absorbing ideas by means\nof reading had become in him a very strange phenomenon. His eye took\nin six or seven lines at once, and his mind grasped the sense with a\nswiftness as remarkable as that of his eye; sometimes even one word in a\nsentence was enough to enable him to seize the gist of the matter.\n\nHis memory was prodigious. He remembered with equal exactitude the ideas\nhe had derived from reading, and those which had occurred to him in\nthe course of meditation or conversation. Indeed, he had every form of\nmemory--for places, for names, for words, things, and faces. He not\nonly recalled any object at will, but he saw them in his mind, situated,\nlighted, and colored as he had originally seen them. And this power he\ncould exert with equal effect with regard to the most abstract efforts\nof the intellect. He could remember, as he said, not merely the position\nof a sentence in the book where he had met with it, but the frame of\nmind he had been in at remote dates. Thus his was the singular privilege\nof being able to retrace in memory the whole life and progress of his\nmind, from the ideas he had first acquired to the last thought evolved\nin it, from the most obscure to the clearest. His brain, accustomed in\nearly youth to the mysterious mechanism by which human faculties are\nconcentrated, drew from this rich treasury endless images full of life\nand freshness, on which he fed his spirit during those lucid spells of\ncontemplation.\n\n""Whenever I wish it,"" said he to me in his own language, to which a fund\nof remembrance gave precocious originality, ""I can draw a veil over\nmy eyes. Then I suddenly see within me a camera obscura, where natural\nobjects are reproduced in purer forms than those under which they first\nappeared to my external sense.""\n\nAt the age of twelve his imagination, stimulated by the perpetual\nexercise of his faculties, had developed to a point which permitted him\nto have such precise concepts of things which he knew only from reading\nabout them, that the image stamped on his mind could not have been\nclearer if he had actually seen them, whether this was by a process of\nanalogy or that he was gifted with a sort of second sight by which he\ncould command all nature.\n\n""When I read the story of the battle of Austerlitz,"" said he to me one\nday, ""I saw every incident. The roar of the cannon, the cries of the\nfighting men rang in my ears, and made my inmost self quiver; I could\nsmell the powder; I heard the clatter of horses and the voices of men; I\nlooked down on the plain where armed nations were in collision, just as\nif I had been on the heights of Santon. The scene was as terrifying as\na passage from the Apocalypse."" On the occasions when he brought all his\npowers into play, and in some degree lost consciousness of his physical\nexistence, and lived on only by the remarkable energy of his mental\npowers, whose sphere was enormously expanded, he left space behind him,\nto use his own words.\n\nBut I will not here anticipate the intellectual phases of his life.\nAlready, in spite of myself, I have reversed the order in which I ought\nto tell the history of this man, who transferred all his activities to\nthinking, as others throw all their life into action.\n\nA strong bias drew his mind into mystical studies.\n\n""_Abyssus abyssum_,"" he would say. ""Our spirit is abysmal and loves\nthe abyss. In childhood, manhood, and old age we are always eager for\nmysteries in whatever form they present themselves.""\n\nThis predilection was disastrous; if indeed his life can be measured by\nordinary standards, or if we may gauge another\'s happiness by our own or\nby social notions. This taste for the ""things of heaven,"" another phrase\nhe was fond of using, this _mens divinior_, was due perhaps to the\ninfluence produced on his mind by the first books he read at his\nuncle\'s. Saint Theresa and Madame Guyon were a sequel to the Bible; they\nhad the first-fruits of his manly intelligence, and accustomed him to\nthose swift reactions of the soul of which ecstasy is at once the result\nand the means. This line of study, this peculiar taste, elevated his\nheart, purified, ennobled it, gave him an appetite for the divine\nnature, and suggested to him the almost womanly refinement of feeling\nwhich is instinctive in great men; perhaps their sublime superiority is\nno more than the desire to devote themselves which characterizes woman,\nonly transferred to the greatest things.\n\nAs a result of these early impressions, Louis passed immaculate through\nhis school life; this beautiful virginity of the senses naturally\nresulted in the richer fervor of his blood, and in increased faculties\nof mind.\n\nThe Baroness de Stael, forbidden to come within forty leagues of Paris,\nspent several months of her banishment on an estate near Vendome. One\nday, when out walking, she met on the skirts of the park the tanner\'s\nson, almost in rags, and absorbed in reading. The book was a translation\nof _Heaven and Hell_. At that time Monsieur Saint-Martin, Monsieur de\nGence, and a few other French or half German writers were almost the\nonly persons in the French Empire to whom the name of Swedenborg was\nknown. Madame de Stael, greatly surprised, took the book from him with\nthe roughness she affected in her questions, looks, and manners, and\nwith a keen glance at Lambert,--\n\n""Do you understand all this?"" she asked.\n\n""Do you pray to God?"" said the child.\n\n""Why? yes!""\n\n""And do you understand Him?""\n\nThe Baroness was silent for a moment; then she sat down by Lambert, and\nbegan to talk to him. Unfortunately, my memory, though retentive, is far\nfrom being so trustworthy as my friend\'s, and I have forgotten the whole\nof the dialogue excepting those first words.\n\nSuch a meeting was of a kind to strike Madame de Stael very greatly;\non her return home she said but little about it, notwithstanding an\neffusiveness which in her became mere loquacity; but it evidently\noccupied her thoughts.\n\nThe only person now living who preserves any recollection of the\nincident, and whom I catechised to be informed of what few words Madame\nde Stael had let drop, could with difficulty recall these words spoken\nby the Baroness as describing Lambert, ""He is a real seer.""\n\nLouis failed to justify in the eyes of the world the high hopes he had\ninspired in his protectress. The transient favor she showed him was\nregarded as a feminine caprice, one of the fancies characteristic of\nartist souls. Madame de Stael determined to save Louis Lambert alike\nfrom serving the Emperor or the Church, and to preserve him for the\nglorious destiny which, she thought, awaited him; for she made him out\nto be a second Moses snatched from the waters. Before her departure she\ninstructed a friend of hers, Monsieur de Corbigny, to send her Moses in\ndue course to the High School at Vendome; then she probably forgot him.\n\n\n\nHaving entered this college at the age of fourteen, early in 1811,\nLambert would leave it at the end of 1814, when he had finished the\ncourse of Philosophy. I doubt whether during the whole time he ever\nheard a word of his benefactress--if indeed it was the act of a\nbenefactress to pay for a lad\'s schooling for three years without a\nthought of his future prospects, after diverting him from a career in\nwhich he might have found happiness. The circumstances of the time, and\nLouis Lambert\'s character, may to a great extent absolve Madame de Stael\nfor her thoughtlessness and her generosity. The gentleman who was to\nhave kept up communications between her and the boy left Blois just at\nthe time when Louis passed out of the college. The political events that\nensued were then a sufficient excuse for this gentleman\'s neglect of\nthe Baroness\' protege. The authoress of _Corinne_ heard no more of her\nlittle Moses.\n\nA hundred louis, which she placed in the hands of Monsieur de Corbigny,\nwho died, I believe, in 1812, was not a sufficiently large sum to leave\nlasting memories in Madame de Stael, whose excitable nature found ample\npasture during the vicissitudes of 1814 and 1815, which absorbed all her\ninterest.\n\nAt this time Louis Lambert was at once too proud and too poor to go in\nsearch of a patroness who was traveling all over Europe. However, he\nwent on foot from Blois to Paris in the hope of seeing her, and arrived,\nunluckily, on the very day of her death. Two letters from Lambert to\nthe Baroness remained unanswered. The memory of Madame de Stael\'s good\nintentions with regard to Louis remains, therefore, only in some few\nyoung minds, struck, as mine was, by the strangeness of the story.\n\nNo one who had not gone through the training at our college could\nunderstand the effect usually made on our minds by the announcement that\na ""new boy"" had arrived, or the impression that such an adventure as\nLouis Lambert\'s was calculated to produce.\n\nAnd here a little information must be given as to the primitive\nadministration of this institution, originally half-military and\nhalf-monastic, to explain the new life which there awaited Lambert.\nBefore the Revolution, the Oratorians, devoted, like the Society of\nJesus, to the education of youth--succeeding the Jesuits, in fact, in\ncertain of their establishments--the colleges of Vendome, of Tournon,\nof la Fleche, Pont-Levoy, Sorreze, and Juilly. That at Vendome, like the\nothers, I believe, turned out a certain number of cadets for the army.\nThe abolition of educational bodies, decreed by the convention, had but\nlittle effect on the college at Vendome. When the first crisis had blown\nover, the authorities recovered possession of their buildings; certain\nOratorians, scattered about the country, came back to the college\nand re-opened it under the old rules, with the habits, practices,\nand customs which gave this school a character with which I have seen\nnothing at all comparable in any that I have visited since I left that\nestablishment.\n\nStanding in the heart of the town, on the little river Loire which flows\nunder its walls, the college possesses extensive precincts, carefully\nenclosed by walls, and including all the buildings necessary for\nan institution on that scale: a chapel, a theatre, an infirmary,\na bakehouse, gardens, and water supply. This college is the most\ncelebrated home of learning in all the central provinces, and receives\npupils from them and from the colonies. Distance prohibits any frequent\nvisits from parents to their children.\n\nThe rule of the House forbids holidays away from it. Once entered there,\na pupil never leaves till his studies are finished. With the exception\nof walks taken under the guidance of the Fathers, everything is\ncalculated to give the School the benefit of conventual discipline; in\nmy day the tawse was still a living memory, and the classical leather\nstrap played its terrible part with all the honors. The punishment\noriginally invented by the Society of Jesus, as alarming to the moral\nas to the physical man, was still in force in all the integrity of the\noriginal code.\n\nLetters to parents were obligatory on certain days, so was confession.\nThus our sins and our sentiments were all according to pattern.\nEverything bore the stamp of monastic rule. I well remember, among\nother relics of the ancient order, the inspection we went through every\nSunday. We were all in our best, placed in file like soldiers to await\nthe arrival of the two inspectors who, attended by the tutors and the\ntradesmen, examined us from the three points of view of dress, health,\nand morals.\n\nThe two or three hundred pupils lodged in the establishment were\ndivided, according to ancient custom, into the _minimes_ (the smallest),\nthe little boys, the middle boys, and the big boys. The division of\nthe _minimes_ included the eighth and seventh classes; the little boys\nformed the sixth, fifth, and fourth; the middle boys were classed as\nthird and second; and the first class comprised the senior students--of\nphilosophy, rhetoric, the higher mathematics, and chemistry. Each of\nthese divisions had its own building, classrooms, and play-ground, in\nthe large common precincts on to which the classrooms opened, and beyond\nwhich was the refectory.\n\nThis dining-hall, worthy of an ancient religious Order, accommodated all\nthe school. Contrary to the usual practice in educational institutions,\nwe were allowed to talk at our meals, a tolerant Oratorian rule which\nenabled us to exchange plates according to our taste. This gastronomical\nbarter was always one of the chief pleasures of our college life. If one\nof the ""middle"" boys at the head of his table wished for a helping of\nlentils instead of dessert--for we had dessert--the offer was passed\ndown from one to another: ""Dessert for lentils!"" till some other epicure\nhad accepted; then the plate of lentils was passed up to the bidder\nfrom hand to hand, and the plate of dessert returned by the same road.\nMistakes were never made. If several identical offers were made, they\nwere taken in order, and the formula would be, ""Lentils number one for\ndessert number one."" The tables were very long; our incessant barter\nkept everything moving; we transacted it with amazing eagerness; and the\nchatter of three hundred lads, the bustling to and fro of the servants\nemployed in changing the plates, setting down the dishes, handing the\nbread, with the tours of inspection of the masters, made this refectory\nat Vendome a scene unique in its way, and the amazement of visitors.\n\nTo make our life more tolerable, deprived as we were of all\ncommunication with the outer world and of family affection, we were\nallowed to keep pigeons and to have gardens. Our two or three hundred\npigeon-houses, with a thousand birds nesting all round the outer wall,\nand above thirty garden plots, were a sight even stranger than our\nmeals. But a full account of the peculiarities which made the college at\nVendome a place unique in itself and fertile in reminiscences to those\nwho spent their boyhood there, would be weariness to the reader. Which\nof us all but remembers with delight, notwithstanding the bitterness\nof learning, the eccentric pleasures of that cloistered life? The\nsweetmeats purchased by stealth in the course of our walks, permission\nobtained to play cards and devise theatrical performances during the\nholidays, such tricks and freedom as were necessitated by our seclusion;\nthen, again, our military band, a relic of the cadets; our academy,\nour chaplain, our Father professors, and all our games permitted or\nprohibited, as the case might be; the cavalry charges on stilts, the\nlong slides made in winter, the clatter of our clogs; and, above all,\nthe trading transactions with ""the shop"" set up in the courtyard itself.\n\nThis shop was kept by a sort of cheap-jack, of whom big and little\nboys could procure--according to his prospectus--boxes, stilts, tools,\nJacobin pigeons, and Nuns, Mass-books--an article in small demand\n--penknives, paper, pens, pencils, ink of all colors, balls and marbles;\nin short, the whole catalogue of the most treasured possessions of boys,\nincluding everything from sauce for the pigeons we were obliged to kill\noff, to the earthenware pots in which we set aside the rice from supper\nto be eaten at next morning\'s breakfast. Which of us was so unhappy as\nto have forgotten how his heart beat at the sight of this booth, open\nperiodically during play-hours on Sundays, to which we went, each in his\nturn, to spend his little pocket-money; while the smallness of the sum\nallowed by our parents for these minor pleasures required us to make a\nchoice among all the objects that appealed so strongly to our desires?\nDid ever a young wife, to whom her husband, during the first days of\nhappiness, hands, twelve times a year, a purse of gold, the budget of\nher personal fancies, dream of so many different purchases, each of\nwhich would absorb the whole sum, as we imagined possible on the eve of\nthe first Sunday in each month? For six francs during one night we owned\nevery delight of that inexhaustible shop! and during Mass every response\nwe chanted was mixed up in our minds with our secret calculations.\nWhich of us all can recollect ever having had a sou left to spend on\nthe Sunday following? And which of us but obeyed the instinctive law of\nsocial existence by pitying, helping, and despising those pariahs who,\nby the avarice or poverty of their parents, found themselves penniless?\n\nAny one who forms a clear idea of this huge college, with its monastic\nbuildings in the heart of a little town, and the four plots in which\nwe were distributed as by a monastic rule, will easily conceive of\nthe excitement that we felt at the arrival of a new boy, a passenger\nsuddenly embarked on the ship. No young duchess, on her first appearance\nat Court, was ever more spitefully criticised than the new boy by the\nyouths in his division. Usually during the evening play-hour before\nprayers, those sycophants who were accustomed to ingratiate themselves\nwith the Fathers who took it in turns two and two for a week to keep an\neye on us, would be the first to hear on trustworthy authority: ""There\nwill be a new boy to-morrow!"" and then suddenly the shout, ""A New\nBoy!--A New Boy!"" rang through the courts. We hurried up to crowd round\nthe superintendent and pester him with questions:\n\n""Where was he coming from? What was his name? Which class would he be\nin?"" and so forth.\n\nLouis Lambert\'s advent was the subject of a romance worthy of the\n_Arabian Nights_. I was in the fourth class at the time--among the\nlittle boys. Our housemasters were two men whom we called Fathers from\nhabit and tradition, though they were not priests. In my time there\nwere indeed but three genuine Oratorians to whom this title legitimately\nbelonged; in 1814 they all left the college, which had gradually become\nsecularized, to find occupation about the altar in various country\nparishes, like the cure of Mer.\n\nFather Haugoult, the master for the week, was not a bad man, but of very\nmoderate attainments, and he lacked the tact which is indispensable for\ndiscerning the different characters of children, and graduating their\npunishment to their powers of resistance. Father Haugoult, then, began\nvery obligingly to communicate to his pupils the wonderful events which\nwere to end on the morrow in the advent of the most singular of ""new\nboys."" Games were at an end. All the children came round in silence to\nhear the story of Louis Lambert, discovered, like an aerolite, by Madame\nde Stael, in a corner of the wood. Monsieur Haugoult had to tell us all\nabout Madame de Stael; that evening she seemed to me ten feet high; I\nsaw at a later time the picture of Corinne, in which Gerard represents\nher as so tall and handsome; and, alas! the woman painted by my\nimagination so far transcended this, that the real Madame de Stael fell\nat once in my estimation, even after I read her book of really masculine\npower, _De l\'Allemagne_.\n\nBut Lambert at that time was an even greater wonder. Monsieur Mareschal,\nthe headmaster, after examining him, had thought of placing him among\nthe senior boys. It was Louis\' ignorance of Latin that placed him so low\nas the fourth class, but he would certainly leap up a class every year;\nand, as a remarkable exception, he was to be one of the ""Academy."" _Proh\npudor_! we were to have the honor of counting among the ""little\nboys"" one whose coat was adorned with the red ribbon displayed by the\n""Academicians"" of Vendome. These Academicians enjoyed distinguished\nprivileges; they often dined at the director\'s table, and held two\nliterary meetings annually, at which we were all present to hear their\nelucubrations. An Academician was a great man in embryo. And if every\nVendome scholar would speak the truth, he would confess that, in later\nlife, an Academician of the great French Academy seemed to him far less\nremarkable than the stupendous boy who wore the cross and the imposing\nred ribbon which were the insignia of our ""Academy.""\n\nIt was very unusual to be one of that illustrious body before attaining\nto the second class, for the Academicians were expected to hold public\nmeetings every Thursday during the holidays, and to read tales in verse\nor prose, epistles, essays, tragedies, dramas--compositions far above\nthe intelligence of the lower classes. I long treasured the memory of\na story called the ""Green Ass,"" which was, I think, the masterpiece of\nthis unknown Society. In the fourth, and an Academician! This boy of\nfourteen, a poet already, the protege of Madame de Stael, a coming\ngenius, said Father Haugoult, was to be one of us! a wizard, a youth\ncapable of writing a composition or a translation while we were being\ncalled into lessons, and of learning his lessons by reading them through\nbut once. Louis Lambert bewildered all our ideas. And Father Haugoult\'s\ncuriosity and impatience to see this new boy added fuel to our excited\nfancy.\n\n""If he has pigeons, he can have no pigeon-house; there is not room for\nanother. Well, it cannot be helped,"" said one boy, since famous as an\nagriculturist.\n\n""Who will sit next to him?"" said another.\n\n""Oh, I wish I might be his chum!"" cried an enthusiast.\n\nIn school language, the word here rendered chum--_faisant_, or in some\nschools, _copin_--expressed a fraternal sharing of the joys and evils of\nyour childish existence, a community of interests that was fruitful of\nsquabbling and making friends again, a treaty of alliance offensive and\ndefensive. It is strange, but never in my time did I know brothers who\nwere chums. If man lives by his feelings, he thinks perhaps that he will\nmake his life the poorer if he merges an affection of his own choosing\nin a natural tie.\n\nThe impression made upon me by Father Haugoult\'s harangue that evening\nis one of the most vivid reminiscences of my childhood; I can compare it\nwith nothing but my first reading of _Robinson Crusoe_. Indeed, I owe to\nmy recollection of these prodigious impressions an observation that\nmay perhaps be new as to the different sense attached to words by each\nhearer. The word in itself has no final meaning; we affect a word more\nthan it affects us; its value is in relation to the images we have\nassimilated and grouped round it; but a study of this fact would\nrequire considerable elaboration, and lead us too far from our immediate\nsubject.\n\nNot being able to sleep, I had a long discussion with my next neighbor\nin the dormitory as to the remarkable being who on the morrow was to\nbe one of us. This neighbor, who became an officer, and is now a writer\nwith lofty philosophical views, Barchou de Penhoen, has not been false\nto his pre-destination, nor to the hazard of fortune by which the only\ntwo scholars of Vendome, of whose fame Vendome ever hears, were brought\ntogether in the same classroom, on the same form, and under the same\nroof. Our comrade Dufaure had not, when this book was published, made\nhis appearance in public life as a lawyer. The translator of Fichte, the\nexpositor and friend of Ballanche, was already interested, as I myself\nwas, in metaphysical questions; we often talked nonsense together about\nGod, ourselves, and nature. He at that time affected pyrrhonism. Jealous\nof his place as leader, he doubted Lambert\'s precocious gifts; while\nI, having lately read _Les Enfants celebres_, overwhelmed him with\nevidence, quoting young Montcalm, Pico della Mirandola, Pascal--in\nshort, a score of early developed brains, anomalies that are famous in\nthe history of the human mind, and Lambert\'s predecessors.\n\nI was at the time passionately addicted to reading. My father, who was\nambitious to see me in the Ecole Polytechnique, paid for me to have a\nspecial course of private lessons in mathematics. My mathematical master\nwas the librarian of the college, and allowed me to help myself to books\nwithout much caring what I chose to take from the library, a quiet spot\nwhere I went to him during play-hours to have my lesson. Either he was\nno great mathematician, or he was absorbed in some grand scheme, for he\nvery willingly left me to read when I ought to have been learning, while\nhe worked at I knew not what. So, by a tacit understanding between us,\nI made no complaints of being taught nothing, and he said nothing of the\nbooks I borrowed.\n\nCarried away by this ill-timed mania, I neglected my studies to compose\npoems, which certainly can have shown no great promise, to judge by\na line of too many feet which became famous among my companions--the\nbeginning of an epic on the Incas:\n\n  ""O Inca! O roi infortune et malheureux!""\n\nIn derision of such attempts, I was nicknamed the Poet, but mockery did\nnot cure me. I was always rhyming, in spite of good advice from Monsieur\nMareschal, the headmaster, who tried to cure me of an unfortunately\ninveterate passion by telling me the fable of a linnet that fell out\nof the nest because it tried to fly before its wings were grown. I\npersisted in my reading; I became the least emulous, the idlest, the\nmost dreamy of all the division of ""little boys,"" and consequently the\nmost frequently punished.\n\nThis autobiographical digression may give some idea of the reflections I\nwas led to make in anticipation of Lambert\'s arrival. I was then twelve\nyears old. I felt sympathy from the first for the boy whose temperament\nhad some points of likeness to my own. I was at last to have a companion\nin daydreams and meditations. Though I knew not yet what glory meant, I\nthought it glory to be the familiar friend of a child whose immortality\nwas foreseen by Madame de Stael. To me Louis Lambert was as a giant.\n\nThe looked-for morrow came at last. A minute before breakfast we\nheard the steps of Monsieur Mareschal and of the new boy in the quiet\ncourtyard. Every head was turned at once to the door of the classroom.\nFather Haugoult, who participated in our torments of curiosity, did not\nsound the whistle he used to reduce our mutterings to silence and bring\nus back to our tasks. We then saw this famous new boy, whom Monsieur\nMareschal was leading by the hand. The superintendent descended from his\ndesk, and the headmaster said to him solemnly, according to etiquette:\n""Monsieur, I have brought you Monsieur Louis Lambert; will you place him\nin the fourth class? He will begin work to-morrow.""\n\nThen, after speaking a few words in an undertone to the class-master, he\nsaid:\n\n""Where can he sit?""\n\nIt would have been unfair to displace one of us for a newcomer; so as\nthere was but one desk vacant, Louis Lambert came to fill it, next to\nme, for I had last joined the class. Though we still had some time to\nwait before lessons were over, we all stood up to look at Louis Lambert.\nMonsieur Mareschal heard our mutterings, saw how eager we were, and\nsaid, with the kindness that endeared him to us all:\n\n""Well, well, but make no noise; do not disturb the other classes.""\n\nThese words set us free to play some little time before breakfast, and\nwe all gathered round Lambert while Monsieur Mareschal walked up and\ndown the courtyard with Father Haugoult.\n\nThere were about eighty of us little demons, as bold as birds of prey.\nThough we ourselves had all gone through this cruel novitiate, we showed\nno mercy on a newcomer, never sparing him the mockery, the catechism,\nthe impertinence, which were inexhaustible on such occasions, to the\ndiscomfiture of the neophyte, whose manners, strength, and temper were\nthus tested. Lambert, whether he was stoical or dumfounded, made no\nreply to any questions. One of us thereupon remarked that he was no\ndoubt of the school of Pythagoras, and there was a shout of laughter.\nThe new boy was thenceforth Pythagoras through all his life at the\ncollege. At the same time, Lambert\'s piercing eye, the scorn expressed\nin his face for our childishness, so far removed from the stamp of his\nown nature, the easy attitude he assumed, and his evident strength in\nproportion to his years, infused a certain respect into the veriest\nscamps among us. For my part, I kept near him, absorbed in studying him\nin silence.\n\n\n\nLouis Lambert was slightly built, nearly five feet in height; his face\nwas tanned, and his hands were burnt brown by the sun, giving him an\nappearance of manly vigor, which, in fact, he did not possess. Indeed,\ntwo months after he came to the college, when studying in the classroom\nhad faded his vivid, so to speak, vegetable coloring, he became as pale\nand white as a woman.\n\nHis head was unusually large. His hair, of a fine, bright black in\nmasses of curls, gave wonderful beauty to his brow, of which the\nproportions were extraordinary even to us heedless boys, knowing\nnothing, as may be supposed, of the auguries of phrenology, a science\nstill in its cradle. The distinction of this prophetic brow lay\nprincipally in the exquisitely chiseled shape of the arches under which\nhis black eyes sparkled, and which had the transparency of alabaster,\nthe line having the unusual beauty of being perfectly level to where it\nmet the top of the nose. But when you saw his eyes it was difficult to\nthink of the rest of his face, which was indeed plain enough, for their\nlook was full of a wonderful variety of expression; they seemed to have\na soul in their depths. At one moment astonishingly clear and piercing,\nat another full of heavenly sweetness, those eyes became dull, almost\ncolorless, as it seemed, when he was lost in meditation. They then\nlooked like a window from which the sun had suddenly vanished after\nlighting it up. His strength and his voice were no less variable;\nequally rigid, equally unexpected. His tone could be as sweet as that of\na woman compelled to own her love; at other times it was labored, rough,\nrugged, if I may use such words in a new sense. As to his strength, he\nwas habitually incapable of enduring the fatigue of any game, and seemed\nweakly, almost infirm. But during the early days of his school-life,\none of our little bullies having made game of this sickliness, which\nrendered him unfit for the violent exercise in vogue among his fellows,\nLambert took hold with both hands of one of the class-tables, consisting\nof twelve large desks, face to face and sloping from the middle; he\nleaned back against the class-master\'s desk, steadying the table with\nhis feet on the cross-bar below, and said:\n\n""Now, ten of you try to move it!""\n\nI was present, and can vouch for this strange display of strength; it\nwas impossible to move the table.\n\nLambert had the gift of summoning to his aid at certain times the most\nextraordinary powers, and of concentrating all his forces on a given\npoint. But children, like men, are wont to judge of everything by first\nimpressions, and after the first few days we ceased to study Louis; he\nentirely belied Madame de Stael\'s prognostications, and displayed none\nof the prodigies we looked for in him.\n\nAfter three months at school, Louis was looked upon as a quite ordinary\nscholar. I alone was allowed really to know that sublime--why should\nI not say divine?--soul, for what is nearer to God than genius in the\nheart of a child? The similarity of our tastes and ideas made us friends\nand chums; our intimacy was so brotherly that our school-fellows joined\nour two names; one was never spoken without the other, and to call\neither they always shouted ""Poet-and-Pythagoras!"" Some other names had\nbeen known coupled in a like manner. Thus for two years I was the\nschool friend of poor Louis Lambert; and during that time my life was\nso identified with his, that I am enabled now to write his intellectual\nbiography.\n\nIt was long before I fully knew the poetry and the wealth of ideas that\nlay hidden in my companion\'s heart and brain. It was not till I was\nthirty years of age, till my experience was matured and condensed, till\nthe flash of an intense illumination had thrown a fresh light upon it,\nthat I was capable of understanding all the bearings of the phenomena\nwhich I witnessed at that early time. I benefited by them without\nunderstanding their greatness or their processes; indeed, I have\nforgotten some, or remember only the most conspicuous facts; still, my\nmemory is now able to co-ordinate them, and I have mastered the secrets\nof that fertile brain by looking back to the delightful days of our\nboyish affection. So it was time alone that initiated me into the\nmeaning of the events and facts that were crowded into that obscure\nlife, as into that of many another man who is lost to science. Indeed,\nthis narrative, so far as the expression and appreciation of many\nthings is concerned, will be found full of what may be termed moral\nanachronisms, which perhaps will not detract from its peculiar interest.\n\nIn the course of the first few months after coming to Vendome, Louis\nbecame the victim of a malady which, though the symptoms were invisible\nto the eye of our superiors, considerably interfered with the exercise\nof his remarkable gifts. Accustomed to live in the open air, and to the\nfreedom of a purely haphazard education, happy in the tender care of an\nold man who was devoted to him, used to meditating in the sunshine, he\nfound it very hard to submit to college rules, to walk in the ranks, to\nlive within the four walls of a room where eighty boys were sitting\nin silence on wooden forms each in front of his desk. His senses were\ndeveloped to such perfection as gave them the most sensitive keenness,\nand every part of him suffered from this life in common.\n\nThe effluvia that vitiated the air, mingled with the odors of a\nclassroom that was never clean, nor free from the fragments of our\nbreakfasts or snacks, affected his sense of smell, the sense which,\nbeing more immediately connected than the others with the nerve-centers\nof the brain, must, when shocked, cause invisible disturbance to the\norgans of thought.\n\nBesides these elements of impurity in the atmosphere, there were\nlockers in the classrooms in which the boys kept their miscellaneous\nplunder--pigeons killed for fete days, or tidbits filched from the\ndinner-table. In each classroom, too, there was a large stone slab, on\nwhich two pails full of water were kept standing, a sort of sink, where\nwe every morning washed our faces and hands, one after another, in the\nmaster\'s presence. We then passed on to a table, where women combed and\npowdered our hair. Thus the place, being cleaned but once a day before\nwe were up, was always more or less dirty. In spite of numerous windows\nand lofty doors, the air was constantly fouled by the smells from the\nwashing-place, the hairdressing, the lockers, and the thousand messes\nmade by the boys, to say nothing of their eighty closely packed bodies.\nAnd this sort of _humus_, mingling with the mud we brought in from the\nplaying-yard, produced a suffocatingly pestilent muck-heap.\n\nThe loss of the fresh and fragrant country air in which he had hitherto\nlived, the change of habits and strict discipline, combined to depress\nLambert. With his elbow on his desk and his head supported on his left\nhand, he spent the hours of study gazing at the trees in the court or\nthe clouds in the sky; he seemed to be thinking of his lessons; but\nthe master, seeing his pen motionless, or the sheet before him still a\nblank, would call out:\n\n""Lambert, you are doing nothing!""\n\nThis ""_you are doing nothing_!"" was a pin-thrust that wounded Louis to\nthe quick. And then he never earned the rest of the play-time; he always\nhad impositions to write. The imposition, a punishment which varies\naccording to the practice of different schools, consisted at Vendome of\na certain number of lines to be written out in play hours. Lambert and\nI were so overpowered with impositions, that we had not six free days\nduring the two years of our school friendship. But for the books we took\nout of the library, which maintained some vitality in our brains, this\nsystem of discipline would have reduced us to idiotcy. Want of exercise\nis fatal to children. The habit of preserving a dignified appearance,\nbegun in tender infancy, has, it is said, a visible effect on the\nconstitution of royal personages when the faults of such an education\nare not counteracted by the life of the battle-field or the laborious\nsport of hunting. And if the laws of etiquette and Court manners can act\non the spinal marrow to such an extent as to affect the pelvis of\nkings, to soften their cerebral tissue, and so degenerate the race, what\ndeep-seated mischief, physical and moral, must result in schoolboys from\nthe constant lack of air, exercise, and cheerfulness!\n\nIndeed, the rules of punishment carried out in schools deserve the\nattention of the Office of Public Instruction when any thinkers are to\nbe found there who do not think exclusively of themselves.\n\nWe incurred the infliction of an imposition in a thousand ways. Our\nmemory was so good that we never learned a lesson. It was enough for\neither of us to hear our class-fellows repeat the task in French, Latin,\nor grammar, and we could say it when our turn came; but if the master,\nunfortunately, took it into his head to reverse the usual order and call\nupon us first, we very often did not even know what the lesson was;\nthen the imposition fell in spite of our most ingenious excuses. Then we\nalways put off writing our exercises till the last moment; if there\nwere a book to be finished, or if we were lost in thought, the task was\nforgotten--again an imposition. How often have we scribbled an exercise\nduring the time when the head-boy, whose business it was to collect them\nwhen we came into school, was gathering them from the others!\n\nIn addition to the moral misery which Lambert went through in trying\nto acclimatize himself to college life, there was a scarcely less cruel\napprenticeship through which every boy had to pass: to those bodily\nsufferings which seemed infinitely varied. The tenderness of a child\'s\nskin needs extreme care, especially in winter, when a school-boy is\nconstantly exchanging the frozen air of the muddy playing-yard for the\nstuffy atmosphere of the classroom. The ""little boys"" and the smallest\nof all, for lack of a mother\'s care, were martyrs to chilblains and\nchaps so severe that they had to be regularly dressed during the\nbreakfast hour; but this could only be very indifferently done to so\nmany damaged hands, toes, and heels. A good many of the boys indeed\nwere obliged to prefer the evil to the remedy; the choice constantly lay\nbetween their lessons waiting to be finished or the joys of a slide, and\nwaiting for a bandage carelessly put on, and still more carelessly cast\noff again. Also it was the fashion in the school to gibe at the poor,\nfeeble creatures who went to be doctored; the bullies vied with each\nother in snatching off the rags which the infirmary nurse had tied on.\nHence, in winter, many of us, with half-dead feet and fingers, sick with\npain, were incapable of work, and punished for not working. The Fathers,\ntoo often deluded by shammed ailments, would not believe in real\nsuffering.\n\nThe price paid for our schooling and board also covered the cost of\nclothing. The committee contracted for the shoes and clothes supplied to\nthe boys; hence the weekly inspection of which I have spoken. This plan,\nthough admirable for the manager, is always disastrous to the managed.\nWoe to the boy who indulged in the bad habit of treading his shoes down\nat heel, of cracking the shoe-leather, or wearing out the soles too\nfast, whether from a defect in his gait, or by fidgeting during lessons\nin obedience to the instinctive need of movement common to all children.\nThat boy did not get through the winter without great suffering. In the\nfirst place, his chilblains would ache and shot as badly as a fit of the\ngout; then the rivets and pack-thread intended to repair the shoes would\ngive way, or the broken heels would prevent the wretched shoes from\nkeeping on his feet; he was obliged to drag them wearily along the\nfrozen roads, or sometimes to dispute their possession with the clay\nsoil of the district; the water and snow got in through some unnoticed\ncrack or ill-sewn patch, and the foot would swell.\n\nOut of sixty boys, not ten perhaps could walk without some special form\nof torture; and yet they all kept up with the body of the troop, dragged\non by the general movement, as men are driven through life by life\nitself. Many a time some proud-tempered boy would shed tears of rage\nwhile summoning his remaining energy to run ahead and get home again in\nspite of pain, so sensitively afraid of laughter or of pity--two forms\nof scorn--is the still tender soul at that age.\n\nAt school, as in social life, the strong despise the feeble without\nknowing in what true strength consists.\n\nNor was this all. No gloves. If by good hap a boy\'s parents, the\ninfirmary nurse, or the headmaster gave gloves to a particularly\ndelicate lad, the wags or the big boys of the class would put them on\nthe stove, amused to see them dry and shrivel; or if the gloves escaped\nthe marauders, after getting wet they shrunk as they dried for want\nof care. No, gloves were impossible. Gloves were a privilege, and boys\ninsist on equality.\n\nLouis Lambert fell a victim to all these varieties of torment. Like\nmany contemplative men, who, when lost in thought, acquire a habit of\nmechanical motion, he had a mania for fidgeting with his shoes, and\ndestroyed them very quickly. His girlish complexion, the skin of his\nears and lips, cracked with the least cold. His soft, white hands grew\nred and swollen. He had perpetual colds. Thus he was a constant\nsufferer till he became inured to school-life. Taught at last by cruel\nexperience, he was obliged to ""look after his things,"" to use the school\nphrase. He was forced to take care of his locker, his desk, his clothes,\nhis shoes; to protect his ink, his books, his copy-paper, and his pens\nfrom pilferers; in short, to give his mind to the thousand details of\nour trivial life, to which more selfish and commonplace minds devoted\nsuch strict attention--thus infallibly securing prizes for ""proficiency""\nand ""good conduct""--while they were overlooked by a boy of the highest\npromise, who, under the hand of an almost divine imagination, gave\nhimself up with rapture to the flow of his ideas.\n\nThis was not all. There is a perpetual struggle going on between the\nmasters and the boys, a struggle without truce, to be compared with\nnothing else in the social world, unless it be the resistance of\nthe opposition to the ministry in a representative government. But\njournalists and opposition speakers are probably less prompt to take\nadvantage of a weak point, less extreme in resenting an injury, and less\nmerciless in their mockery than boys are in regard to those who rule\nover them. It is a task to put angels out of patience. An unhappy\nclass-master must then not be too severely blamed, ill-paid as he is,\nand consequently not too competent, if he is occasionally unjust or out\nof temper. Perpetually watched by a hundred mocking eyes, and surrounded\nwith snares, he sometimes revenges himself for his own blunders on the\nboys who are only too ready to detect them.\n\nUnless for serious misdemeanors, for which there were other forms of\npunishment, the strap was regarded at Vendome as the _ultima ratio\nPatrum_. Exercises forgotten, lessons ill learned, common ill behavior\nwere sufficiently punished by an imposition, but offended dignity spoke\nin the master through the strap. Of all the physical torments to which\nwe were exposed, certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this\nleathern instrument, about two fingers wide, applied to our poor little\nhands with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator. To\nendure this classical form of correction, the victim knelt in the middle\nof the room. He had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the\nmaster\'s desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his\nfellows. To sensitive natures these preliminaries were an introductory\ntorture, like the journey from the Palais de Justice to the Place de\nGreve which the condemned used to make to the scaffold.\n\nSome boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the\napplication of the strap; others accepted the infliction with stoic\ncalm; it was a question of nature; but few could control an expression\nof anguish in anticipation.\n\nLouis Lambert was constantly enduring the strap, and owed it to a\npeculiarity of his physiognomy of which he was for a long time quite\nunconscious. Whenever he was suddenly roused from a fit of abstraction\nby the master\'s cry, ""You are doing nothing!"" it often happened that,\nwithout knowing it, he flashed at his teacher a look full of fierce\ncontempt, and charged with thought, as a Leyden jar is charged with\nelectricity. This look, no doubt, discomfited the master, who, indignant\nat this unspoken retort, wished to cure his scholar of that thunderous\nflash.\n\nThe first time the Father took offence at this ray of scorn, which\nstruck him like a lightning-flash, he made this speech, as I well\nremember:\n\n""If you look at me again in that way, Lambert, you will get the strap.""\n\nAt these words every nose was in the air, every eye looked alternately\nat the master and at Louis. The observation was so utterly foolish, that\nthe boy again looked at the Father, overwhelming him with another\nflash. From this arose a standing feud between Lambert and his master,\nresulting in a certain amount of ""strap."" Thus did he first discover the\npower of his eye.\n\nThe hapless poet, so full of nerves, as sensitive as a woman, under the\nsway of chronic melancholy, and as sick with genius as a girl with\nlove that she pines for, knowing nothing of it;--this boy, at once so\npowerful and so weak, transplanted by ""Corinne"" from the country he\nloved, to be squeezed in the mould of a collegiate routine to which\nevery spirit and every body must yield, whatever their range or\ntemperament, accepting its rule and its uniform as gold is crushed into\nround coin under the press; Louis Lambert suffered in every spot where\npain can touch the soul or the flesh. Stuck on a form, restricted to\nthe acreage of his desk, a victim of the strap and to a sickly frame,\ntortured in every sense, environed by distress--everything compelled\nhim to give his body up to the myriad tyrannies of school life; and,\nlike the martyrs who smiled in the midst of suffering, he took refuge in\nheaven, which lay open to his mind. Perhaps this life of purely inward\nemotions helped him to see something of the mysteries he so entirely\nbelieved in!\n\nOur independence, our illicit amusements, our apparent waste of time,\nour persistent indifference, our frequent punishments and aversion for\nour exercises and impositions, earned us a reputation, which no one\ncared to controvert, for being an idle and incorrigible pair. Our\nmasters treated us with contempt, and we fell into utter disgrace with\nour companions, from whom we concealed our secret studies for fear\nof being laughed at. This hard judgment, which was injustice in the\nmasters, was but natural in our schoolfellows. We could neither play\nball, nor run races, nor walk on stilts. On exceptional holidays, when\namnesty was proclaimed and we got a few hours of freedom, we shared in\nnone of the popular diversions of the school. Aliens from the pleasures\nenjoyed by the others, we were outcasts, sitting forlorn under a tree in\nthe playing-ground. The Poet-and-Pythagoras formed an exception and led\na life apart from the life of the rest.\n\nThe penetrating instinct and unerring conceit of schoolboys made them\nfeel that we were of a nature either far above or far beneath their own;\nhence some simply hated our aristocratic reserve, others merely scorned\nour ineptitude. These feelings were equally shared by us without our\nknowing it; perhaps I have but now divined them. We lived exactly like\ntwo rats, huddled into the corner of the room where our desks were,\nsitting there alike during lesson time and play hours. This strange\nstate of affairs inevitably and in fact placed us on a footing of war\nwith all the other boys in our division. Forgotten for the most part, we\nsat there very contentedly; half happy, like two plants, two images\nwho would have been missed from the furniture of the room. But the most\naggressive of our schoolfellows would sometimes torment us, just to\nshow their malignant power, and we responded with stolid contempt, which\nbrought many a thrashing down on the Poet-and-Pythagoras.\n\nLambert\'s home-sickness lasted for many months. I know no words to\ndescribe the dejection to which he was a prey. Louis has taken the glory\noff many a masterpiece for me. We had both played the part of the ""Leper\nof Aosta,"" and had both experienced the feelings described in Monsieur\nde Maistre\'s story, before we read them as expressed by his eloquent\npen. A book may, indeed, revive the memories of our childhood, but it\ncan never compete with them successfully. Lambert\'s woes had taught me\nmany a chant of sorrow far more appealing than the finest passages in\n""Werther."" And, indeed, there is no possible comparison between the\npangs of a passion condemned, whether rightly or wrongly, by every law,\nand the grief of a poor child pining for the glorious sunshine, the\ndews of the valley, and liberty. Werther is the slave of desire; Louis\nLambert was an enslaved soul. Given equal talent, the more pathetic\nsorrow, founded on desires which, being purer, are the more genuine,\nmust transcend the wail even of genius.\n\nAfter sitting for a long time with his eyes fixed on a lime-tree in the\nplayground, Louis would say just a word; but that word would reveal an\ninfinite speculation.\n\n""Happily for me,"" he exclaimed one day, ""there are hours of comfort when\nI feel as though the walls of the room had fallen and I were away--away\nin the fields! What a pleasure it is to let oneself go on the stream of\none\'s thoughts as a bird is borne up on its wings!""\n\n""Why is green a color so largely diffused throughout creation?"" he would\nask me. ""Why are there so few straight lines in nature? Why is it that\nman, in his structures, rarely introduces curves? Why is it that he\nalone, of all creatures, has a sense of straightness?""\n\nThese queries revealed long excursions in space. He had, I am sure, seen\nvast landscapes, fragrant with the scent of woods. He was always silent\nand resigned, a living elegy, always suffering but unable to complain of\nsuffering. An eagle that needed the world to feed him, shut in between\nfour narrow, dirty walls; and thus this life became an ideal life in the\nstrictest meaning of the words. Filled as he was with contempt of the\nalmost useless studies to which we were harnessed, Louis went on his\nskyward way absolutely unconscious of the things about us.\n\nI, obeying the imitative instinct that is so strong in childhood, tired\nto regulate my life in conformity with his. And Louis the more easily\ninfected me with the sort of torpor in which deep contemplation leaves\nthe body, because I was younger and more impressionable than he. Like\ntwo lovers, we got into the habit of thinking together in a common\nreverie. His intuitions had already acquired that acuteness which must\nsurely characterize the intellectual perceptiveness of great poets and\noften bring them to the verge of madness.\n\n""Do you ever feel,"" said he to me one day, ""as though imagined suffering\naffected you in spite of yourself? If, for instance, I think with\nconcentration of the effect that the blade of my penknife would have in\npiercing my flesh, I feel an acute pain as if I had really cut myself;\nonly the blood is wanting. But the pain comes suddenly, and startles me\nlike a sharp noise breaking profound silence. Can an idea cause physical\npain?--What do you say to that, eh?""\n\nWhen he gave utterance to such subtle reflections, we both fell\ninto artless meditation; we set to work to detect in ourselves the\ninscrutable phenomena of the origin of thoughts, which Lambert hoped to\ndiscover in their earliest germ, so as to describe some day the unknown\nprocess. Then, after much discussion, often mixed up with childish\nnotions, a look would flash from Lambert\'s eager eyes; he would grasp my\nhand, and a word from the depths of his soul would show the current of\nhis mind.\n\n""Thinking is seeing,"" said he one day, carried away by some objection\nraised as to the first principles of our organization. ""Every human\nscience is based on deduction, which is a slow process of seeing by\nwhich we work up from the effect to the cause; or, in a wider sense, all\npoetry, like every work of art, proceeds from a swift vision of things.""\n\nHe was a spiritualist (as opposed to materialism); but I would venture\nto contradict him, using his own arguments to consider the intellect\nas a purely physical phenomenon. We both were right. Perhaps the words\nmaterialism and spiritualism express the two faces of the same fact. His\nconsiderations on the substance of the mind led to his accepting, with\na certain pride, the life of privation to which we were condemned in\nconsequence of our idleness and our indifference to learning. He had a\ncertain consciousness of his own powers which bore him up through his\nspiritual cogitations. How delightful it was to me to feel his soul\nacting on my own! Many a time have we remained sitting on our form, both\nburied in one book, having quite forgotten each other\'s existence, and\nyet not apart; each conscious of the other\'s presence, and bathing in an\nocean of thought, like two fish swimming in the same waters.\n\nOur life, apparently, was merely vegetating; but we lived through our\nheart and brain.\n\nLambert\'s influence over my imagination left traces that still abide.\nI used to listen hungrily to his tales, full of the marvels which make\nmen, as well as children, rapturously devour stories in which truth\nassumes the most grotesque forms. His passion for mystery, and the\ncredulity natural to the young, often led us to discuss Heaven and Hell.\nThen Louis, by expounding Swedenborg, would try to make me share in his\nbeliefs concerning angels. In his least logical arguments there were\nstill amazing observations as to the powers of man, which gave his words\nthat color of truth without which nothing can be done in any art. The\nromantic end he foresaw as the destiny of man was calculated to flatter\nthe yearning which tempts blameless imaginations to give themselves up\nto beliefs. Is it not during the youth of a nation that its dogmas and\nidols are conceived? And are not the supernatural beings before whom the\npeople tremble the personification of their feelings and their magnified\ndesires?\n\n\n\nAll that I can now remember of the poetical conversations we held\ntogether concerning the Swedish prophet, whose works I have since had\nthe curiosity to read, may be told in a few paragraphs.\n\nIn each of us there are two distinct beings. According to Swedenborg,\nthe angel is an individual in whom the inner being conquers the external\nbeing. If a man desires to earn his call to be an angel, as soon as his\nmind reveals to him his twofold existence, he must strive to foster the\ndelicate angelic essence that exists within him. If, for lack of a lucid\nappreciation of his destiny, he allows bodily action to predominate,\ninstead of confirming his intellectual being, all his powers will be\nabsorbed in the use of his external senses, and the angel will slowly\nperish by the materialization of both natures. In the contrary case, if\nhe nourishes his inner being with the aliment needful to it, the soul\ntriumphs over matter and strives to get free.\n\nWhen they separate by the act of what we call death, the angel, strong\nenough then to cast off its wrappings, survives and begins its real\nlife. The infinite variety which differentiates individual men can only\nbe explained by this twofold existence, which, again, is proved and made\nintelligible by that variety.\n\nIn point of fact, the wide distance between a man whose torpid\nintelligence condemns him to evident stupidity, and one who, by the\nexercise of his inner life, has acquired the gift of some power, allows\nus to suppose that there is as great a difference between men of genius\nand other beings as there is between the blind and those who see. This\nhypothesis, since it extends creation beyond all limits, gives us, as it\nwere, the clue to heaven. The beings who, here on earth, are apparently\nmingled without distinction, are there distributed, according to their\ninner perfection, in distinct spheres whose speech and manners have\nnothing in common. In the invisible world, as in the real world, if some\nnative of the lower spheres comes, all unworthy, into a higher sphere,\nnot only can he never understand the customs and language there, but his\nmere presence paralyzes the voice and hearts of those who dwell therein.\n\nDante, in his _Divine Comedy_, had perhaps some slight intuition of\nthose spheres which begin in the world of torment, and rise, circle on\ncircle, to the highest heaven. Thus Swedenborg\'s doctrine is the product\nof a lucid spirit noting down the innumerable signs by which the angels\nmanifest their presence among men.\n\nThis doctrine, which I have endeavored to sum up in a more or less\nconsistent form, was set before me by Lambert with all the fascination\nof mysticism, swathed in the wrappings of the phraseology affected by\nmystical writers: an obscure language full of abstractions, and\ntaking such effect on the brain, that there are books by Jacob Boehm,\nSwedenborg, and Madame Guyon, so strangely powerful that they give rise\nto phantasies as various as the dreams of the opium-eater. Lambert told\nme of mystical facts so extraordinary, he so acted on my imagination,\nthat he made my brain reel. Still, I loved to plunge into that realm\nof mystery, invisible to the senses, in which every one likes to dwell,\nwhether he pictures it to himself under the indefinite ideal of the\nFuture, or clothes it in the more solid guise of romance. These violent\nrevulsions of the mind on itself gave me, without my knowing it, a\ncomprehension of its power, and accustomed me to the workings of the\nmind.\n\nLambert himself explained everything by his theory of the angels. To him\npure love--love as we dream of it in youth--was the coalescence of two\nangelic natures. Nothing could exceed the fervency with which he longed\nto meet a woman angel. And who better than he could inspire or feel\nlove? If anything could give an impression of an exquisite nature,\nwas it not the amiability and kindliness that marked his feelings, his\nwords, his actions, his slightest gestures, the conjugal regard that\nunited us as boys, and that we expressed when we called ourselves\n_chums_?\n\nThere was no distinction for us between my ideas and his. We imitated\neach other\'s handwriting, so that one might write the tasks of\nboth. Thus, if one of us had a book to finish and to return to the\nmathematical master, he could read on without interruption while the\nother scribbled off his exercise and imposition. We did our tasks as\nthough paying a task on our peace of mind. If my memory does not play\nme false, they were sometimes of remarkable merit when Lambert did\nthem. But on the foregone conclusion that we were both of us idiots, the\nmaster always went through them under a rooted prejudice, and even kept\nthem to read to be laughed at by our schoolfellows.\n\nI remember one afternoon, at the end of the lesson, which lasted from\ntwo till four, the master took possession of a page of translation by\nLambert. The passage began with _Caius Gracchus, vir nobilis_; Lambert\nhad construed this by ""Caius Gracchus had a noble heart.""\n\n""Where do you find \'heart\' in _nobilis_?"" said the Father sharply.\n\nAnd there was a roar of laughter, while Lambert looked at the master in\nsome bewilderment.\n\n""What would Madame la Baronne de Stael say if she could know that you\nmake such nonsense of a word that means noble family, of patrician\nrank?""\n\n""She would say that you were an ass!"" said I in a muttered tone.\n\n""Master Poet, you will stay in for a week,"" replied the master, who\nunfortunately overheard me.\n\nLambert simply repeated, looking at me with inexpressible affection,\n""_Vir nobilis_!""\n\nMadame de Stael was, in fact, partly the cause of Lambert\'s troubles. On\nevery pretext masters and pupils threw the name in his teeth, either in\nirony or in reproof.\n\nLouis lost no time in getting himself ""kept in"" to share my\nimprisonment. Freer thus than in any other circumstances, we could talk\nthe whole day long in the silence of the dormitories, where each boy had\na cubicle six feet square, the partitions consisting at the top of open\nbars. The doors, fitted with gratings, were locked at night and\nopened in the morning under the eye of the Father whose duty it was to\nsuperintend our rising and going to bed. The creak of these gates, which\nthe college servants unlocked with remarkable expedition, was a sound\npeculiar to that college. These little cells were our prison, and boys\nwere sometimes shut up there for a month at a time. The boys in these\ncoops were under the stern eye of the prefect, a sort of censor who\nstole up at certain hours, or at unexpected moments, with a silent step,\nto hear if we were talking instead of writing our impositions. But a few\nwalnut shells dropped on the stairs, or the sharpness of our hearing,\nalmost always enabled us to beware of his coming, so we could give\nourselves up without anxiety to our favorite studies. However, as\nbooks were prohibited, our prison hours were chiefly filled up with\nmetaphysical discussions, or with relating singular facts connected with\nthe phenomena of mind.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary of these incidents beyond question is\nthis, which I will here record, not only because it concerns Lambert,\nbut because it perhaps was the turning-point of his scientific career.\nBy the law of custom in all schools, Thursday and Sunday were holidays;\nbut the services, which we were made to attend very regularly, so\ncompletely filled up Sunday, that we considered Thursday our only real\nday of freedom. After once attending Mass, we had a long day before us\nto spend in walks in the country round the town of Vendome. The manor of\nRochambeau was the most interesting object of our excursions, perhaps\nby reason of its distance; the smaller boys were very seldom taken on so\nfatiguing an expedition. However, once or twice a year the class-masters\nwould hold out Rochambeau as a reward for diligence.\n\nIn 1812, towards the end of the spring, we were to go there for the\nfirst time. Our anxiety to see this famous chateau of Rochambeau, where\nthe owner sometimes treated the boys to milk, made us all very good,\nand nothing hindered the outing. Neither Lambert nor I had ever seen the\npretty valley of the Loire where the house stood. So his imagination and\nmine were much excited by the prospect of this excursion, which filled\nthe school with traditional glee. We talked of it all the evening,\nplanning to spend in fruit or milk such money as we had saved, against\nall the habits of school-life.\n\nAfter dinner next day, we set out at half-past twelve, each provided\nwith a square hunch of bread, given to us for our afternoon snack.\nAnd off we went, as gay as swallows, marching in a body on the famous\nchateau with an eagerness which would at first allow of no fatigue.\nWhen we reached the hill, whence we looked down on the house standing\nhalf-way down the slope, on the devious valley through which the river\nwinds and sparkles between meadows in graceful curves--a beautiful\nlandscape, one of those scenes to which the keen emotions of early youth\nor of love lend such a charm, that it is wise never to see them again in\nlater years--Louis Lambert said to me, ""Why, I saw this last night in a\ndream.""\n\nHe recognized the clump of trees under which we were standing, the\ngrouping of the woods, the color of the water, the turrets of the\nchateau, the details, the distance, in fact every part of the prospect\nwhich we looked on for the first time. We were mere children; I, at any\nrate, who was but thirteen; Louis, at fifteen, might have the precocity\nof genius, but at that time we were incapable of falsehood in the most\ntrivial matters of our life as friends. Indeed, if Lambert\'s powerful\nmind had any presentiment of the importance of such facts, he was far\nfrom appreciating their whole bearing; and he was quite astonished\nby this incident. I asked him if he had not perhaps been brought\nto Rochambeau in his infancy, and my question struck him; but after\nthinking it over, he answered in the negative. This incident, analogous\nto what may be known of the phenomena of sleep in several persons, will\nillustrate the beginnings of Lambert\'s line of talent; he took it, in\nfact, as the basis of a whole system, using a fragment--as Cuvier did in\nanother branch of inquiry--as a clue to the reconstruction of a complete\nsystem.\n\nAt this moment we were sitting together on an old oak-stump, and after a\nfew minutes\' reflection, Louis said to me:\n\n""If the landscape did not come to me--which it is absurd to imagine--I\nmust have come here. If I was here while I was asleep in my cubicle,\ndoes not that constitute a complete severance of my body and my inner\nbeing? Does it not prove some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the\nspirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body? Well,\nthen, if my spirit and my body can be severed during sleep, why should\nI not insist on their separating in the same way while I am awake? I see\nno half-way mean between the two propositions.\n\n""But if we go further into details: either the facts are due to the\naction of a faculty which brings out a second being to whom my body is\nmerely a husk, since I was in my cell, and yet I saw the landscape--and\nthis upsets many systems; or the facts took place either in some nerve\ncentre, of which the name is yet to be discovered, where our feelings\ndwell and move; or else in the cerebral centre, where ideas are formed.\nThis last hypothesis gives rise to some strange questions. I walked, I\nsaw, I heard. Motion is inconceivable but in space, sound acts only at\ncertain angles or on surfaces, color is caused only by light. If, in the\ndark, with my eyes shut, I saw, in myself, colored objects; if I heard\nsounds in the most perfect silence and without the conditions requisite\nfor the production of sound; if without stirring I traversed wide tracts\nof space, there must be inner faculties independent of the external laws\nof physics. Material nature must be penetrable by the spirit.\n\n""How is it that men have hitherto given so little thought to the\nphenomena of sleep, which seem to prove that man has a double life? May\nthere not be a new science lying beneath them?"" he added, striking his\nbrow with his hand. ""If not the elements of a science, at any rate the\nrevelation of stupendous powers in man; at least they prove a frequent\nseverance of our two natures, the fact I have been thinking out for\na very long time. At last, then, I have hit on evidence to show the\nsuperiority that distinguishes our latent senses from our corporeal\nsenses! _Homo duplex_!\n\n""And yet,"" he went on, after a pause, with a doubtful shrug, ""perhaps\nwe have not two natures; perhaps we are merely gifted with personal\nand perfectible qualities, of which the development within us produces\ncertain unobserved phenomena of activity, penetration, and vision. In\nour love of the marvelous, a passion begotten of our pride, we have\ntranslated these effects into poetical inventions, because we did not\nunderstand them. It is so convenient to deify the incomprehensible!\n\n""I should, I own, lament over the loss of my illusions. I so much wished\nto believe in our twofold nature and in Swedenborg\'s angels. Must this\nnew science destroy them? Yes; for the study of our unknown properties\ninvolves us in a science that appears to be materialistic, for the\nSpirit uses, divides, and animates the Substance; but it does not\ndestroy it.""\n\nHe remained pensive, almost sad. Perhaps he saw the dreams of his youth\nas swaddling clothes that he must soon shake off.\n\n""Sight and hearing are, no doubt, the sheaths for a very marvelous\ninstrument,"" said he, laughing at his own figure of speech.\n\nAlways when he was talking to me of Heaven and Hell, he was wont to\ntreat of Nature as being master; but now, as he pronounced these last\nwords, big with prescience, he seemed to soar more boldly than ever\nabove the landscape, and his forehead seemed ready to burst with the\nafflatus of genius. His powers--mental powers we must call them till\nsome new term is found--seemed to flash from the organs intended to\nexpress them. His eyes shot out thoughts; his uplifted hand, his silent\nbut tremulous lips were eloquent; his burning glance was radiant; at\nlast his head, as though too heavy, or exhausted by too eager a flight,\nfell on his breast. This boy--this giant--bent his head, took my hand\nand clasped it in his own, which was damp, so fevered was he for the\nsearch for truth; then, after a pause, he said:\n\n""I shall be famous!--And you, too,"" he added after a pause. ""We will\nboth study the Chemistry of the Will.""\n\nNoble soul! I recognized his superiority, though he took great care\nnever to make me feel it. He shared with me all the treasures of his\nmind, and regarded me as instrumental in his discoveries, leaving me the\ncredit of my insignificant contributions. He was always as gracious as\na woman in love; he had all the bashful feeling, the delicacy of soul\nwhich make life happy and pleasant to endure.\n\n\n\nOn the following day he began writing what he called a _Treatise on the\nWill_; his subsequent reflections led to many changes in its plan and\nmethod; but the incident of that day was certainly the germ of the work,\njust as the electric shock always felt by Mesmer at the approach of\na particular manservant was the starting-point of his discoveries in\nmagnetism, a science till then interred under the mysteries of Isis, of\nDelphi, of the cave of Trophonius, and rediscovered by that prodigious\ngenius, close on Lavater, and the precursor of Gall.\n\nLambert\'s ideas, suddenly illuminated by this flash of light, assumed\nvaster proportions; he disentangled certain truths from his many\nacquisitions and brought them into order; then, like a founder, he cast\nthe model of his work. At the end of six months\' indefatigable labor,\nLambert\'s writings excited the curiosity of our companions, and became\nthe object of cruel practical jokes which led to a fatal issue.\n\nOne day one of the masters, who was bent on seeing the manuscripts,\nenlisted the aid of our tyrants, and came to seize, by force, a box that\ncontained the precious papers. Lambert and I defended it with incredible\ncourage. The trunk was locked, our aggressors could not open it, but\nthey tried to smash it in the struggle, a stroke of malignity at which\nwe shrieked with rage. Some of the boys, with a sense of justice, or\nstruck perhaps by our heroic defence, advised the attacking party to\nleave us in peace, crushing us with insulting contempt. But suddenly,\nbrought to the spot by the noise of a battle, Father Haugoult roughly\nintervened, inquiring as to the cause of the fight. Our enemies had\ninterrupted us in writing our impositions, and the class-master came to\nprotect his slaves. The foe, in self-defence, betrayed the existence of\nthe manuscript. The dreadful Haugoult insisted on our giving up the box;\nif we should resist, he would have it broken open. Lambert gave him the\nkey; the master took out the papers, glanced through them, and said, as\nhe confiscated them:\n\n""And it is for such rubbish as this that you neglect your lessons!""\n\nLarge tears fell from Lambert\'s eyes, wrung from him as much by a\nsense of his offended moral superiority as by the gratuitous insult and\nbetrayal that he had suffered. We gave the accusers a glance of stern\nreproach: had they not delivered us over to the common enemy? If the\ncommon law of school entitled them to thrash us, did it not require them\nto keep silence as to our misdeeds?\n\nIn a moment they were no doubt ashamed of their baseness.\n\nFather Haugoult probably sold the _Treatise on the Will_ to a local\ngrocer, unconscious of the scientific treasure, of which the germs thus\nfell into unworthy hands.\n\n\n\nSix months later I left the school, and I do not know whether Lambert\never recommenced his labors. Our parting threw him into a mood of the\ndarkest melancholy.\n\nIt was in memory of the disaster that befell Louis\' book that, in the\ntale which comes first in these _Etudes_, I adopted the title invented\nby Lambert for a work of fiction, and gave the name of a woman who was\ndear to him to a girl characterized by her self-devotion; but this is\nnot all I have borrowed from him: his character and occupations were of\ngreat value to me in writing that book, and the subject arose from\nsome reminiscences of our youthful meditations. This present volume is\nintended as a modest monument, a broken column, to commemorate the life\nof the man who bequeathed to me all he had to leave--his thoughts.\n\nIn that boyish effort Lambert had enshrined the ideas of a man. Ten\nyears later, when I met some learned men who were devoting serious\nattention to the phenomena that had struck us and that Lambert had so\nmarvelously analyzed, I understood the value of his work, then already\nforgotten as childish. I at once spent several months in recalling the\nprincipal theories discovered by my poor schoolmate. Having collected my\nreminiscences, I can boldly state that, by 1812, he had proved, divined,\nand set forth in his Treatise several important facts of which, as\nhe had declared, evidence was certain to come sooner or later. His\nphilosophical speculations ought undoubtedly to gain him recognition as\none of the great thinkers who have appeared at wide intervals among men,\nto reveal to them the bare skeleton of some science to come, of which\nthe roots spread slowly, but which, in due time, bring forth fair fruit\nin the intellectual sphere. Thus a humble artisan, Bernard Palissy,\nsearching the soil to find minerals for glazing pottery, proclaimed,\nin the sixteenth century, with the infallible intuition of genius,\ngeological facts which it is now the glory of Cuvier and Buffon to have\ndemonstrated.\n\nI can, I believe, give some idea of Lambert\'s Treatise by stating the\nchief propositions on which it was based; but, in spite of myself, I\nshall strip them of the ideas in which they were clothed, and which were\nindeed their indispensable accompaniment. I started on a different path,\nand only made use of those of his researches which answered the purpose\nof my scheme. I know not, therefore, whether as his disciple I can\nfaithfully expound his views, having assimilated them in the first\ninstance so as to color them with my own.\n\nNew ideas require new words, or a new and expanded use of old words,\nextended and defined in their meaning. Thus Lambert, to set forth the\nbasis of his system, had adopted certain common words that answered to\nhis notions. The word Will he used to connote the medium in which the\nmind moves, or to use a less abstract expression, the mass of power by\nwhich man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his\nexternal life. Volition--a word due to Locke--expressed the act by which\na man exerts his will. The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as\nthe quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in\nwhich the ideas originate to which thought gives substance. The Idea, a\nname common to every creation of the brain, constituted the act by which\nman uses his mind. Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating\nforces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he\nthought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete\nstate, from its generative fluid to a solid expression, so to speak, if\nsuch words may be taken to formulate notions so difficult of definition.\nAccording to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome\nof our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our\nexternal activity.\n\nHe gave the Will precedence over the Mind.\n\n""You must will before you can think,"" he said. ""Many beings live in\na condition of Willing without ever attaining to the condition of\nThinking. In the North, life is long; in the South, it is shorter; but\nin the North we see torpor, in the South a constant excitability of the\nWill, up to the point where from an excess of cold or of heat the organs\nare almost nullified.""\n\nThe use of the word ""medium"" was suggested to him by an observation he\nhad made in his childhood, though, to be sure, he had no suspicion then\nof its importance, but its singularity naturally struck his delicately\nalert imagination. His mother, a fragile, nervous woman, all\nsensitiveness and affection, was one of those beings created to\nrepresent womanhood in all the perfection of her attributes, but\nrelegated by a mistaken fate to too low a place in the social scale.\nWholly loving, and consequently wholly suffering, she died young, having\nthrown all her energies into her motherly love. Lambert, a child of six,\nlying, but not always sleeping, in a cot by his mother\'s bed, saw the\nelectric sparks from her hair when she combed it. The man of fifteen\nmade scientific application of this fact which had amused the child, a\nfact beyond dispute, of which there is ample evidence in many\ninstances, especially of women who by a sad fatality are doomed to let\nunappreciated feelings evaporate in the air, or some superabundant power\nrun to waste.\n\nIn support of his definitions, Lambert propounded a variety of problems\nto be solved, challenges flung out to science, though he proposed to\nseek the solution for himself. He inquired, for instance, whether the\nelement that constitutes electricity does not enter as a base into the\nspecific fluid whence our Ideas and Volitions proceed? Whether the\nhair, which loses its color, turns white, falls out, or disappears, in\nproportion to the decay or crystallization of our thoughts, may not be\nin fact a capillary system, either absorbent or diffusive, and wholly\nelectrical? Whether the fluid phenomena of the Will, a matter generated\nwithin us, and spontaneously reacting under the impress of conditions\nas yet unobserved, were at all more extraordinary than those of the\ninvisible and intangible fluid produced by a voltaic pile, and applied\nto the nervous system of a dead man? Whether the formation of Ideas and\ntheir constant diffusion was less incomprehensible than evaporation of\nthe atoms, imperceptible indeed, but so violent in their effects, that\nare given off from a grain of musk without any loss of weight. Whether,\ngranting that the function of the skin is purely protective, absorbent,\nexcretive, and tactile, the circulation of the blood and all its\nmechanism would not correspond with the transsubstantiation of our Will,\nas the circulation of the nerve fluid corresponds to that of the Mind?\nFinally, whether the more or less rapid affluence of these two real\nsubstances may not be the result of a certain perfection or imperfection\nof organs whose conditions require investigation in every manifestation?\n\nHaving set forth these principles, he proposed to class the phenomena of\nhuman life in two series of distinct results, demanding, with the ardent\ninsistency of conviction, a special analysis for each. In fact, having\nobserved in almost every type of created thing two separate motions,\nhe assumed, nay, he asserted, their existence in our human nature, and\ndesignated this vital antithesis Action and Reaction.\n\n""A desire,"" he said, ""is a fact completely accomplished in our will\nbefore it is accomplished externally.""\n\nHence the sum-total of our Volitions and our Ideas constitutes Action,\nand the sum-total of our external acts he called Reaction.\n\nWhen I subsequently read the observations made by Bichat on the duality\nof our external senses, I was really bewildered by my recollections,\nrecognizing the startling coincidences between the views of that\ncelebrated physiologist and those of Louis Lambert. They both died\nyoung, and they had with equal steps arrived at the same strange truths.\nNature has in every case been pleased to give a twofold purpose to the\nvarious apparatus that constitute her creatures; and the twofold action\nof the human organism, which is now ascertained beyond dispute, proves\nby a mass of evidence in daily life how true were Lambert\'s deductions\nas to Action and Reaction.\n\nThe inner Being, the Being of Action--the word he used to designate an\nunknown specialization--the mysterious nexus of fibrils to which we owe\nthe inadequately investigated powers of thought and will--in short, the\nnameless entity which sees, acts, foresees the end, and accomplishes\neverything before expressing itself in any physical phenomenon--must,\nin conformity with its nature, be free from the physical conditions by\nwhich the external Being of Reaction, the visible man, is fettered in\nits manifestation. From this followed a multitude of logical explanation\nas to those results of our twofold nature which appear the strangest,\nand a rectification of various systems in which truth and falsehood are\nmingled.\n\nCertain men, having had a glimpse of some phenomena of the natural\nworking of the Being of Action, were, like Swedenborg, carried away\nabove this world by their ardent soul, thirsting for poetry, and filled\nwith the Divine Spirit. Thus, in their ignorance of the causes and their\nadmiration of the facts, they pleased their fancy by regarding that\ninner man as divine, and constructing a mystical universe. Hence we have\nangels! A lovely illusion which Lambert would never abandon, cherishing\nit even when the sword of his logic was cutting off their dazzling\nwings.\n\n""Heaven,"" he would say, ""must, after all, be the survival of our\nperfected faculties, and hell the void into which our unperfected\nfaculties are cast away.""\n\nBut how, then, in the ages when the understanding had preserved the\nreligious and spiritualist impressions, which prevailed from the time\nof Christ till that of Descartes, between faith and doubt, how could men\nhelp accounting for the mysteries of our nature otherwise than by divine\ninterposition? Of whom but of God Himself could sages demand an account\nof an invisible creature so actively and so reactively sensitive, gifted\nwith faculties so extensive, so improvable by use, and so powerful under\ncertain occult influences, that they could sometimes see it\nannihilate, by some phenomenon of sight or movement, space in its two\nmanifestations--Time and Distance--of which the former is the space of\nthe intellect, the latter is physical space? Sometimes they found it\nreconstructing the past, either by the power of retrospective vision, or\nby the mystery of a palingenesis not unlike the power a man might have\nof detecting in the form, integument, and embryo in a seed, the flowers\nof the past, and the numberless variations of their color, scent, and\nshape; and sometimes, again, it could be seen vaguely foreseeing\nthe future, either by its apprehension of final causes, or by some\nphenomenon of physical presentiment.\n\nOther men, less poetically religious, cold, and argumentative--quacks\nperhaps, but enthusiasts in brain at least, if not in heart\n--recognizing some isolated examples of such phenomena, admitted their\ntruth while refusing to consider them as radiating from a common centre.\nEach of these was, then, bent on constructing a science out of a simple\nfact. Hence arose demonology, judicial astrology, the black arts, in\nshort, every form of divination founded on circumstances that\nwere essentially transient, because they varied according to men\'s\ntemperament, and to conditions that are still completely unknown.\n\nBut from these errors of the learned, and from the ecclesiastical trials\nunder which fell so many martyrs to their own powers, startling evidence\nwas derived of the prodigious faculties at the command of the Being of\nAction, which, according to Lambert, can abstract itself completely from\nthe Being of Reaction, bursting its envelope, and piercing walls by its\npotent vision; a phenomenon known to the Hindoos, as missionaries tell\nus, by the name of _Tokeiad_; or again, by another faculty, can grasp\nin the brain, in spite of its closest convolutions, the ideas which are\nformed or forming there, and the whole of past consciousness.\n\n""If apparitions are not impossible,"" said Lambert, ""they must be due\nto a faculty of discerning the ideas which represent man in his purest\nessence, whose life, imperishable perhaps, escapes our grosser senses,\nthough they may become perceptible to the inner being when it has\nreached a high degree of ecstasy, or a great perfection of vision.""\n\nI know--though my remembrance is now vague--that Lambert, by following\nthe results of Mind and Will step by step, after he had established\ntheir laws, accounted for a multitude of phenomena which, till then,\nhad been regarded with reason as incomprehensible. Thus wizards, men\npossessed with second sight, and demoniacs of every degree--the victims\nof the Middle Ages--became the subject of explanations so natural, that\ntheir very simplicity often seemed to me the seal of their truth. The\nmarvelous gifts which the Church of Rome, jealous of all mysteries,\npunished with the stake, were, in Louis\' opinion, the result of certain\naffinities between the constituent elements of matter and those of mind,\nwhich proceed from the same source. The man holding a hazel rod when\nhe found a spring of water was guided by some antipathy or sympathy\nof which he was unconscious; nothing but the eccentricity of these\nphenomena could have availed to give some of them historic certainty.\n\nSympathies have rarely been proved; they afford a kind of pleasure which\nthose who are so happy as to possess them rarely speak of unless they\nare abnormally singular, and even then only in the privacy of intimate\nintercourse, where everything is buried. But the antipathies that arise\nfrom the inversion of affinities have, very happily, been recorded when\ndeveloped by famous men. Thus, Bayle had hysterics when he heard water\nsplashing, Scaliger turned pale at the sight of water-cress, Erasmus was\nthrown into a fever by the smell of fish. These three antipathies were\nconnected with water. The Duc d\'Epernon fainted at the sight of a hare,\nTycho-Brahe at that of a fox, Henri III. at the presence of a cat, the\nMarechal d\'Albret at the sight of a wild hog; these antipathies\nwere produced by animal emanations, and often took effect at a great\ndistance. The Chevalier de Guise, Marie de Medici, and many other\npersons have felt faint at seeing a rose even in a painting. Lord Bacon,\nwhether he were forewarned or no of an eclipse of the moon, always fell\ninto a syncope while it lasted; and his vitality, suspended while\nthe phenomenon lasted was restored as soon as it was over without his\nfeeling any further inconvenience. These effects of antipathy, all well\nauthenticated, and chosen from among many which history has happened\nto preserve, are enough to give a clue to the sympathies which remain\nunknown.\n\nThis fragment of Lambert\'s investigations, which I remember from among\nhis essays, will throw a light on the method on which he worked. I\nneed not emphasize the obvious connection between this theory and the\ncollateral sciences projected by Gall and Lavater; they were its natural\ncorollary; and every more or less scientific brain will discern the\nramifications by which it is inevitably connected with the phrenological\nobservations of one and the speculations on physiognomy of the other.\n\nMesmer\'s discovery, so important, though as yet so little appreciated,\nwas also embodied in a single section of this treatise, though Louis did\nnot know the Swiss doctor\'s writings--which are few and brief.\n\nA simple and logical inference from these principles led him to perceive\nthat the will might be accumulated by a contractile effort of the\ninner man, and then, by another effort, projected, or even imparted, to\nmaterial objects. Thus the whole force of a man must have the property\nof reacting on other men, and of infusing into them an essence foreign\nto their own, if they could not protect themselves against such an\naggression. The evidence of this theorem of the science of humanity\nis, of course, very multifarious; but there is nothing to establish it\nbeyond question. We have only the notorious disaster of Marius and his\nharangue to the Cimbrian commanded to kill him, or the august injunction\nof a mother to the Lion of Florence, in historic proof of instances of\nsuch lightning flashes of mind. To Lambert, then, Will and Thought were\n_living forces_; and he spoke of them in such a way as to impress his\nbelief on the hearer. To him these two forces were, in a way, visible,\ntangible. Thought was slow or alert, heavy or nimble, light or dark; he\nascribed to it all the attributes of an active agent, and thought of it\nas rising, resting, waking, expanding, growing old, shrinking, becoming\natrophied, or resuscitating; he described its life, and specified all\nits actions by the strangest words in our language, speaking of\nits spontaneity, its strength, and all its qualities with a kind of\nintuition which enabled him to recognize all the manifestations of its\nsubstantial existence.\n\n""Often,"" said he, ""in the midst of quiet and silence, when our inner\nfaculties are dormant, when a sort of darkness reigns within us, and\nwe are lost in the contemplation of things outside us, an idea suddenly\nflies forth, and rushes with the swiftness of lightning across the\ninfinite space which our inner vision allows us to perceive. This\nradiant idea, springing into existence like a will-o\'-the-wisp, dies out\nnever to return; an ephemeral life, like that of babes who give their\nparents such infinite joy and sorrow; a sort of still-born blossom in\nthe fields of the mind. Sometimes an idea, instead of springing forcibly\ninto life and dying unembodied, dawns gradually, hovers in the unknown\nlimbo of the organs where it has its birth; exhausts us by long\ngestation, develops, is itself fruitful, grows outwardly in all the\ngrace of youth and the promising attributes of a long life; it can\nendure the closest inspection, invites it, and never tires the sight;\nthe investigation it undergoes commands the admiration we give to works\nslowly elaborated. Sometimes ideas are evolved in a swarm; one brings\nanother; they come linked together; they vie with each other; they fly\nin clouds, wild and headlong. Again, they rise up pallid and misty, and\nperish for want of strength or of nutrition; the vital force is lacking.\nOr again, on certain days, they rush down into the depths to light up\nthat immense obscurity; they terrify us and leave the soul dejected.\n\n""Ideas are a complete system within us, resembling a natural kingdom, a\nsort of flora, of which the iconography will one day be outlined by some\nman who will perhaps be accounted a madman.\n\n""Yes, within us and without, everything testifies to the livingness of\nthose exquisite creations, which I compare with flowers in obedience to\nsome unutterable revelation of their true nature!\n\n""Their being produced as the final cause of man is, after all, not more\namazing than the production of perfume and color in a plant. Perfumes\n_are_ ideas, perhaps!\n\n""When we consider the line where flesh ends and the nail begins contains\nthe invisible and inexplicable mystery of the constant transformation\nof a fluid into horn, we must confess that nothing is impossible in the\nmarvelous modifications of human tissue.\n\n""And are there not in our inner nature phenomena of weight and motion\ncomparable to those of physical nature? Suspense, to choose an example\nvividly familiar to everybody, is painful only as a result of the law in\nvirtue of which the weight of a body is multiplied by its velocity. The\nweight of the feeling produced by suspense increases by the constant\naddition of past pain to the pain of the moment.\n\n""And then, to what, unless it be to the electric fluid, are we to\nattribute the magic by which the Will enthrones itself so imperiously in\nthe eye to demolish obstacles at the behest of genius, thunders in the\nvoice, or filters, in spite of dissimulation, through the human frame?\nThe current of that sovereign fluid, which, in obedience to the high\npressure of thought or of feeling, flows in a torrent or is reduced to a\nmere thread, and collects to flash in lightnings, is the occult agent\nto which are due the evil or the beneficent efforts of Art and\nPassion--intonation of voice, whether harsh or suave, terrible,\nlascivious, horrifying or seductive by turns, thrilling the heart,\nthe nerves, or the brain at our will; the marvels of the touch, the\ninstrument of the mental transfusions of a myriad artists, whose\ncreative fingers are able, after passionate study, to reproduce the\nforms of nature; or, again, the infinite gradations of the eye from dull\ninertia to the emission of the most terrifying gleams.\n\n""By this system God is bereft of none of His rights. Mind, as a form of\nmatter, has brought me a new conviction of His greatness.""\n\nAfter hearing him discourse thus, after receiving into my soul his\nlook like a ray of light, it was difficult not to be dazzled by his\nconviction and carried away by his arguments. The Mind appeared to me as\na purely physical power, surrounded by its innumerable progeny. It was a\nnew conception of humanity under a new form.\n\nThis brief sketch of the laws which, as Lambert maintained, constitute\nthe formula of our intellect, must suffice to give a notion of the\nprodigious activity of his spirit feeding on itself. Louis had sought\nfor proofs of his theories in the history of great men, whose lives, as\nset forth by their biographers, supply very curious particulars as to\nthe operation of their understanding. His memory allowed him to recall\nsuch facts as might serve to support his statements; he had appended\nthem to each chapter in the form of demonstrations, so as to give to\nmany of his theories an almost mathematical certainty. The works of\nCardan, a man gifted with singular powers of insight, supplied him with\nvaluable materials. He had not forgotten that Apollonius of Tyana\nhad, in Asia, announced the death of a tyrant with every detail of his\nexecution, at the very hour when it was taking place in Rome; nor that\nPlotinus, when far away from Porphyrius, was aware of his friend\'s\nintention to kill himself, and flew to dissuade him; nor the incident\nin the last century, proved in the face of the most incredulous mockery\never known--an incident most surprising to men who were accustomed to\nregard doubt as a weapon against the fact alone, but simple enough\nto believers--the fact that Alphonzo-Maria di Liguori, Bishop of\nSaint-Agatha, administered consolations to Pope Ganganelli, who saw\nhim, heard him, and answered him, while the Bishop himself, at a great\ndistance from Rome, was in a trance at home, in the chair where he\ncommonly sat on his return from Mass. On recovering consciousness, he\nsaw all his attendants kneeling beside him, believing him to be dead:\n""My friends,"" said he, ""the Holy Father is just dead."" Two days later a\nletter confirmed the news. The hour of the Pope\'s death coincided with\nthat when the Bishop had been restored to his natural state.\n\nNor had Lambert omitted the yet more recent adventure of an English girl\nwho was passionately attached to a sailor, and set out from London to\nseek him. She found him, without a guide, making her way alone in the\nNorth American wilderness, reaching him just in time to save his life.\n\nLouis had found confirmatory evidence in the mysteries of the ancients,\nin the acts of the martyrs--in which glorious instances may be found\nof the triumph of human will, in the demonology of the Middle Ages, in\ncriminal trials and medical researches; always selecting the real fact,\nthe probable phenomenon, with admirable sagacity.\n\nAll this rich collection of scientific anecdotes, culled from so many\nbooks, most of them worthy of credit, served no doubt to wrap parcels\nin; and this work, which was curious, to say the least of it, as the\noutcome of a most extraordinary memory, was doomed to destruction.\n\nAmong the various cases which added to the value of Lambert\'s _Treatise_\nwas an incident that had taken place in his own family, of which he\nhad told me before he wrote his essay. This fact, bearing on the\npost-existence of the inner man, if I may be allowed to coin a new word\nfor a phenomenon hitherto nameless, struck me so forcibly that I have\nnever forgotten it. His father and mother were being forced into a\nlawsuit, of which the loss would leave them with a stain on their good\nname, the only thing they had in the world. Hence their anxiety was very\ngreat when the question first arose as to whether they should yield to\nthe plaintiff\'s unjust demands, or should defend themselves against him.\nThe matter came under discussion one autumn evening, before a turf fire\nin the room used by the tanner and his wife. Two or three relations\nwere invited to this family council, and among others Louis\' maternal\ngreat-grandfather, an old laborer, much bent, but with a venerable and\ndignified countenance, bright eyes, and a bald, yellow head, on which\ngrew a few locks of thin, white hair. Like the Obi of the Negroes, or\nthe Sagamore of the Indian savages, he was a sort of oracle, consulted\non important occasions. His land was tilled by his grandchildren, who\nfed and served him; he predicted rain and fine weather, and told them\nwhen to mow the hay and gather the crops. The barometric exactitude of\nhis forecasts was quite famous, and added to the confidence and respect\nhe inspired. For whole days he would sit immovable in his armchair. This\nstate of rapt meditation often came upon him since his wife\'s death; he\nhad been attached to her in the truest and most faithful affection.\n\nThis discussion was held in his presence, but he did not seem to give\nmuch heed to it.\n\n""My children,"" said he, when he was asked for his opinion, ""this is too\nserious a matter for me to decide on alone. I must go and consult my\nwife.""\n\nThe old man rose, took his stick, and went out, to the great\nastonishment of the others, who thought him daft. He presently came back\nand said:\n\n""I did not have to go so far as the graveyard; your mother came to\nmeet me; I found her by the brook. She tells me that you will find some\nreceipts in the hands of a notary at Blois, which will enable you to\ngain your suit.""\n\nThe words were spoken in a firm tone; the old man\'s demeanor and\ncountenance showed that such an apparition was habitual with him.\nIn fact, the disputed receipts were found, and the lawsuit was not\nattempted.\n\nThis event, under his father\'s roof and to his own knowledge, when Louis\nwas nine years old, contributed largely to his belief in Swedenborg\'s\nmiraculous visions, for in the course of that philosopher\'s life he\nrepeatedly gave proof of the power of sight developed in his Inner\nBeing. As he grew older, and as his intelligence was developed, Lambert\nwas naturally led to seek in the laws of nature for the causes of the\nmiracle which, in his childhood, had captivated his attention. What name\ncan be given to the chance which brought within his ken so many facts\nand books bearing on such phenomena, and made him the principal subject\nand actor in such marvelous manifestations of mind?\n\nIf Lambert had no other title to fame than the fact of his having\nformulated, in his sixteenth year, such a psychological dictum as\nthis:--""The events which bear witness to the action of the human race,\nand are the outcome of its intellect, have causes by which they are\npreconceived, as our actions are accomplished in our minds before they\nare reproduced by the outer man; presentiments or predictions are the\nperception of these causes""--I think we may deplore in him a genius\nequal to Pascal, Lavoisier, or Laplace. His chimerical notions about\nangels perhaps overruled his work too long; but was it not in trying to\nmake gold that the alchemists unconsciously created chemistry? At the\nsame time, Lambert, at a later period, studied comparative anatomy,\nphysics, geometry, and other sciences bearing on his discoveries, and\nthis was undoubtedly with the purpose of collecting facts and submitting\nthem to analysis--the only torch that can guide us through the dark\nplaces of the most inscrutable work of nature. He had too much good\nsense to dwell among the clouds of theories which can all be expressed\nin a few words. In our day, is not the simplest demonstration based on\nfacts more highly esteemed than the most specious system though defended\nby more or less ingenious inductions? But as I did not know him at\nthe period of his life when his cogitations were, no doubt, the most\nproductive of results, I can only conjecture that the bent of his work\nmust have been from that of his first efforts of thought.\n\nIt is easy to see where his _Treatise on the Will_ was faulty. Though\ngifted already with the powers which characterize superior men, he\nwas but a boy. His brain, though endowed with a great faculty for\nabstractions, was still full of the delightful beliefs that hover around\nyouth. Thus his conception, while at some points it touched the ripest\nfruits of his genius, still, by many more, clung to the smaller elements\nof its germs. To certain readers, lovers of poetry, what he chiefly\nlacked must have been a certain vein of interest.\n\nBut his work bore the stamp of the struggle that was going on in that\nnoble Spirit between the two great principles of Spiritualism and\nMaterialism, round which so many a fine genius has beaten its way\nwithout ever daring to amalgamate them. Louis, at first purely\nSpiritualist, had been irresistibly led to recognize the Material\nconditions of Mind. Confounded by the facts of analysis at the moment\nwhen his heart still gazed with yearning at the clouds which floated\nin Swedenborg\'s heaven, he had not yet acquired the necessary powers to\nproduce a coherent system, compactly cast in a piece, as it were. Hence\ncertain inconsistencies that have left their stamp even on the sketch\nhere given of his first attempts. Still, incomplete as his work may\nhave been, was it not the rough copy of a science of which he would have\ninvestigated the secrets at a later time, have secured the foundations,\nhave examined, deduced, and connected the logical sequence?\n\n\n\nSix months after the confiscation of the _Treatise on the Will_ I left\nschool. Our parting was unexpected. My mother, alarmed by a feverish\nattack which for some months I had been unable to shake off, while my\ninactive life induced symptoms of _coma_, carried me off at four or\nfive hours\' notice. The announcement of my departure reduced Lambert to\ndreadful dejection.\n\n""Shall I ever seen you again?"" said he in his gentle voice, as he\nclasped me in his arms. ""You will live,"" he went on, ""but I shall die.\nIf I can, I will come back to you.""\n\nOnly the young can utter such words with the accent of conviction that\ngives them the impressiveness of prophecy, of a pledge, leaving a terror\nof its fulfilment. For a long time indeed I vaguely looked for the\npromised apparition. Even now there are days of depression, of doubt,\nalarm, and loneliness, when I am forced to repel the intrusion of that\nsad parting, though it was not fated to be the last.\n\nWhen I crossed the yard by which we left, Lambert was at one of the\nrefectory windows to see me pass. By my request my mother obtained leave\nfor him to dine with us at the inn, and in the evening I escorted him\nback to the fatal gate of the college. No lover and his mistress ever\nshed more tears at parting.\n\n""Well, good-bye; I shall be left alone in this desert!"" said he,\npointing to the playground where two hundred boys were disporting\nthemselves and shouting. ""When I come back half dead with fatigue from\nmy long excursions through the fields of thought, on whose heart can\nI rest? I could tell you everything in a look. Who will understand me\nnow?--Good-bye! I could wish I had never met you; I should not know all\nI am losing.""\n\n""And what is to become of me?"" said I. ""Is not my position a dreadful\none? _I_ have nothing here to uphold me!"" and I slapped my forehead.\n\nHe shook his head with a gentle gesture, gracious and sad, and we\nparted.\n\nAt that time Louis Lambert was about five feet five inches in height;\nhe grew no more. His countenance, which was full of expression, revealed\nhis sweet nature. Divine patience, developed by harsh usage, and the\nconstant concentration needed for his meditative life, had bereft his\neyes of the audacious pride which is so attractive in some faces, and\nwhich had so shocked our masters. Peaceful mildness gave charm to his\nface, an exquisite serenity that was never marred by a tinge of irony or\nsatire; for his natural kindliness tempered his conscious strength and\nsuperiority. He had pretty hands, very slender, and almost always\nmoist. His frame was a marvel, a model for a sculptor; but our iron-gray\nuniform, with gilt buttons and knee-breeches, gave us such an ungainly\nappearance that Lambert\'s fine proportions and firm muscles could only\nbe appreciated in the bath. When we swam in our pool in the Loire,\nLouis was conspicuous by the whiteness of his skin, which was unlike the\ndifferent shades of our schoolfellows\' bodies mottled by the cold,\nor blue from the water. Gracefully formed, elegant in his attitudes,\ndelicate in hue, never shivering after his bath, perhaps because he\navoided the shade and always ran into the sunshine, Louis was like one\nof those cautious blossoms that close their petals to the blast and\nrefuse to open unless to a clear sky. He ate little, and drank water\nonly; either by instinct or by choice he was averse to any exertion that\nmade a demand on his strength; his movements were few and simple, like\nthose of Orientals or of savages, with whom gravity seems a condition of\nnature.\n\nAs a rule, he disliked everything that resembled any special care for\nhis person. He commonly sat with his head a little inclined to the left,\nand so constantly rested his elbows on the table, that the sleeves of\nhis coats were soon in holes.\n\nTo this slight picture of the outer man I must add a sketch of his moral\nqualities, for I believe I can now judge him impartially.\n\nThough naturally religious, Louis did not accept the minute practices of\nthe Roman ritual; his ideas were more intimately in sympathy with Saint\nTheresa and Fenelon, and several Fathers and certain Saints, who, in our\nday, would be regarded as heresiarchs or atheists. He was rigidly calm\nduring the services. His own prayers went up in gusts, in aspirations,\nwithout any regular formality; in all things he gave himself up to\nnature, and would not pray, any more than he would think, at any fixed\nhour. In chapel he was equally apt to think of God or to meditate on\nsome problem of philosophy.\n\nTo him Jesus Christ was the most perfect type of his system. _Et Verbum\ncaro factum est_ seemed a sublime statement intended to express the\ntraditional formula of the Will, the Word, and the Act made visible.\nChrist\'s unconsciousness of His Death--having so perfected His inner\nBeing by divine works, that one day the invisible form of it appeared\nto His disciples--and the other Mysteries of the Gospels, the magnetic\ncures wrought by Christ, and the gift of tongues, all to him confirmed\nhis doctrine. I remember once hearing him say on this subject, that\nthe greatest work that could be written nowadays was a History of the\nPrimitive Church. And he never rose to such poetic heights as when,\nin the evening, as we conversed, he would enter on an inquiry into\nmiracles, worked by the power of Will during that great age of faith. He\ndiscerned the strongest evidence of his theory in most of the martyrdoms\nendured during the first century of our era, which he spoke of as _the\ngreat era of the Mind_.\n\n""Do not the phenomena observed in almost every instance of the torments\nso heroically endured by the early Christians for the establishment of\nthe faith, amply prove that Material force will never prevail against\nthe force of Ideas or the Will of man?"" he would say. ""From this effect,\nproduced by the Will of all, each man may draw conclusions in favor of\nhis own.""\n\nI need say nothing of his views on poetry or history, nor of his\njudgment on the masterpieces of our language. There would be little\ninterest in the record of opinions now almost universally held, though\nat that time, from the lips of a boy, they might seem remarkable. Louis\nwas capable of the highest flights. To give a notion of his talents in\na few words, he could have written _Zadig_ as wittily as Voltaire;\nhe could have thought out the dialogue between Sylla and Eucrates as\npowerfully as Montesquieu. His rectitude of character made him desire\nabove all else in a work that it should bear the stamp of utility; at\nthe same time, his refined taste demanded novelty of thought as well as\nof form. One of his most remarkable literary observations, which\nwill serve as a clue to all the others, and show the lucidity of his\njudgment, is this, which has ever dwelt in my memory, ""The Apocalypse\nis written ecstasy."" He regarded the Bible as a part of the traditional\nhistory of the antediluvian nations which had taken for its share the\nnew humanity. He thought that the mythology of the Greeks was borrowed\nboth from the Hebrew Scriptures and from the sacred Books of India,\nadapted after their own fashion by the beauty-loving Hellenes.\n\n""It is impossible,"" said he, ""to doubt the priority of the Asiatic\nScriptures; they are earlier than our sacred books. The man who is\ncandid enough to admit this historical fact sees the whole world expand\nbefore him. Was it not on the Asiatic highland that the few men\ntook refuge who were able to escape the catastrophe that ruined our\nglobe--if, indeed men had existed before that cataclysm or shock? A\nserious query, the answer to which lies at the bottom of the sea. The\nanthropogony of the Bible is merely a genealogy of a swarm escaping from\nthe human hive which settled on the mountainous slopes of Thibet between\nthe summits of the Himalaya and the Caucasus.\n\n""The character of the primitive ideas of that horde called by its\nlawgiver the people of God, no doubt to secure its unity, and perhaps\nalso to induce it to maintain his laws and his system of government\n--for the Books of Moses are a religious, political, and civil code\n--that character bears the authority of terror; convulsions of nature\nare interpreted with stupendous power as a vengeance from on high. In\nfact, since this wandering tribe knew none of the ease enjoyed by a\ncommunity settled in a patriarchal home, their sorrows as pilgrims\ninspired them with none but gloomy poems, majestic but blood-stained. In\nthe Hindoos, on the contrary, the spectacle of the rapid recoveries of\nthe natural world, and the prodigious effects of sunshine, which they\nwere the first to recognize, gave rise to happy images of blissful\nlove, to the worship of Fire and of the endless personifications of\nreproductive force. These fine fancies are lacking in the Book of the\nHebrews. A constant need of self-preservation amid all the dangers and\nthe lands they traversed to reach the Promised Land engendered their\nexclusive race-feeling and their hatred of all other nations.\n\n""These three Scriptures are the archives of an engulfed world. Therein\nlies the secret of the extraordinary splendor of those languages and\ntheir myths. A grand human history lies beneath those names of men and\nplaces, and those fables which charm us so irresistibly, we know not\nwhy. Perhaps it is because we find in them the native air of renewed\nhumanity.""\n\nThus, to him, this threefold literature included all the thoughts of\nman. Not a book could be written, in his opinion, of which the subject\nmight not there be discerned in its germ. This view shows how learnedly\nhe had pursued his early studies of the Bible, and how far they had led\nhim. Hovering, as it were, over the heads of society, and knowing it\nsolely from books, he could judge it coldly.\n\n""The law,"" said he, ""never puts a check on the enterprises of the rich\nand great, but crushes the poor, who, on the contrary, need protection.""\n\nHis kind heart did not therefore allow him to sympathize in political\nideas; his system led rather to the passive obedience of which Jesus\nset the example. During the last hours of my life at Vendome, Louis\nhad ceased to feel the spur to glory; he had, in a way, had an abstract\nenjoyment of fame; and having opened it, as the ancient priests of\nsacrifice sought to read the future in the hearts of men, he had found\nnothing in the entrails of his chimera. Scorning a sentiment so wholly\npersonal: ""Glory,"" said he, ""is but beatified egoism.""\n\nHere, perhaps, before taking leave of this exceptional boyhood, I may\npronounce judgment on it by a rapid glance.\n\nA short time before our separation, Lambert said to me:\n\n""Apart from the general laws which I have formulated--and this, perhaps,\nwill be my glory--laws which must be those of the human organism, the\nlife of man is Movement determined in each individual by the pressure of\nsome inscrutable influence--by the brain, the heart, or the sinews. All\nthe innumerable modes of human existence result from the proportions in\nwhich these three generating forces are more or less intimately combined\nwith the substances they assimilate in the environment they live in.""\n\nHe stopped short, struck his forehead, and exclaimed: ""How strange!\nIn every great man whose portrait I have remarked, the neck is short.\nPerhaps nature requires that in them the heart should be nearer to the\nbrain!""\n\nThen he went on:\n\n""From that, a sum-total of action takes its rise which constitutes\nsocial life. The man of sinew contributes action or strength; the man\nof brain, genius; the man of heart, faith. But,"" he added sadly, ""faith\nsees only the clouds of the sanctuary; the Angel alone has light.""\n\nSo, according to his own definitions, Lambert was all brain and all\nheart. It seems to me that his intellectual life was divided into three\nmarked phases.\n\nUnder the impulsion, from his earliest years, of a precocious activity,\ndue, no doubt, to some malady--or to some special perfection--of\norganism, his powers were concentrated on the functions of the inner\nsenses and a superabundant flow of nerve-fluid. As a man of ideas, he\ncraved to satisfy the thirst of his brain, to assimilate every idea.\nHence his reading; and from his reading, the reflections that gave\nhim the power of reducing things to their simplest expression, and of\nabsorbing them to study them in their essence. Thus, the advantages of\nthis splendid stage, acquired by other men only after long study, were\nachieved by Lambert during his bodily childhood: a happy childhood,\ncolored by the studious joys of a born poet.\n\nThe point which most thinkers reach at last was to him the\nstarting-point, whence his brain was to set out one day in search of\nnew worlds of knowledge. Though as yet he knew it not, he had made for\nhimself the most exacting life possible, and the most insatiably greedy.\nMerely to live, was he not compelled to be perpetually casting nutriment\ninto the gulf he had opened in himself? Like some beings who dwell in\nthe grosser world, might not he die of inanition for want of feeding\nabnormal and disappointed cravings? Was not this a sort of debauchery of\nthe intellect which might lead to spontaneous combustion, like that of\nbodies saturated with alcohol?\n\nI had seen nothing of this first phase of his brain-development; it\nis only now, at a later day, that I can thus give an account of its\nprodigious fruit and results. Lambert was now thirteen.\n\nI was so fortunate as to witness the first stage of the second period.\nLambert was cast into all the miseries of school-life--and that,\nperhaps, was his salvation--it absorbed the superabundance of his\nthoughts. After passing from concrete ideas to their purest expression,\nfrom words to their ideal import, and from that import to principles,\nafter reducing everything to the abstract, to enable him to live he\nyearned for yet other intellectual creations. Quelled by the woes of\nschool and the critical development of his physical constitution, he\nbecame thoughtful, dreamed of feeling, and caught a glimpse of new\nsciences--positively masses of ideas. Checked in his career, and not\nyet strong enough to contemplate the higher spheres, he contemplated his\ninmost self. I then perceived in him the struggle of the Mind reacting\non itself, and trying to detect the secrets of its own nature, like a\nphysician who watches the course of his own disease.\n\nAt this stage of weakness and strength, of childish grace and superhuman\npowers, Louis Lambert is the creature who, more than any other, gave\nme a poetical and truthful image of the being we call an angel, always\nexcepting one woman whose name, whose features, whose identity, and\nwhose life I would fain hide from all the world, so as to be sole master\nof the secret of her existence, and to bury it in the depths of my\nheart.\n\n\n\nThe third phase I was not destined to see. It began when Lambert and I\nwere parted, for he did not leave college till he was eighteen, in the\nsummer of 1815. He had at that time lost his father and mother about six\nmonths before. Finding no member of his family with whom his soul could\nsympathize, expansive still, but, since our parting, thrown back on\nhimself, he made his home with his uncle, who was also his guardian, and\nwho, having been turned out of his benefice as a priest who had taken\nthe oaths, had come to settle at Blois. There Louis lived for some time;\nbut consumed ere long by the desire to finish his incomplete studies,\nhe came to Paris to see Madame de Stael, and to drink of science at its\nhighest fount. The old priest, being very fond of his nephew, left Louis\nfree to spend his whole little inheritance in his three years\' stay in\nParis, though he lived very poorly. This fortune consisted of but a few\nthousand francs.\n\nLambert returned to Blois at the beginning of 1820, driven from Paris by\nthe sufferings to which the impecunious are exposed there. He must often\nhave been a victim to the secret storms, the terrible rage of mind\nby which artists are tossed to judge from the only fact his uncle\nrecollected, and the only letter he preserved of all those which Louis\nLambert wrote to him at that time, perhaps because it was the last and\nthe longest.\n\nTo begin with the story. Louis one evening was at the Theatre-Francais,\nseated on a bench in the upper gallery, near to one of the pillars\nwhich, in those days, divided off the third row of boxes. On rising\nbetween the acts, he saw a young woman who had just come into the box\nnext him. The sight of this lady, who was young, pretty, well dressed,\nin a low bodice no doubt, and escorted by a man for whom her face\nbeamed with all the charms of love, produced such a terrible effect on\nLambert\'s soul and senses, that he was obliged to leave the theatre. If\nhe had not been controlled by some remaining glimmer of reason, which\nwas not wholly extinguished by this first fever of burning passion, he\nmight perhaps have yielded to the most irresistible desire that came\nover him to kill the young man on whom the lady\'s looks beamed. Was not\nthis a reversion, in the heart of the Paris world, to the savage passion\nthat regards women as its prey, an effect of animal instinct combining\nwith the almost luminous flashes of a soul crushed under the weight\nof thought? In short, was it not the prick of the penknife so vividly\nimagined by the boy, felt by the man as the thunderbolt of his most\nvital craving--for love?\n\nAnd now, here is the letter that depicts the state of his mind as it\nwas struck by the spectacle of Parisian civilization. His feelings,\nperpetually wounded no doubt in that whirlpool of self-interest, must\nalways have suffered there; he probably had no friend to comfort him,\nno enemy to give tone to this life. Compelled to live in himself alone,\nhaving no one to share his subtle raptures, he may have hoped to solve\nthe problem of his destiny by a life of ecstasy, adopting an almost\nvegetative attitude, like an anchorite of the early Church, and\nabdicating the empire of the intellectual world.\n\nThis letter seems to hint at such a scheme, which is a temptation to\nall lofty souls at periods of social reform. But is not this purpose,\nin some cases, the result of a vocation? Do not some of them endeavor to\nconcentrate their powers by long silence, so as to emerge fully capable\nof governing the world by word or by deed? Louis must, assuredly, have\nfound much bitterness in his intercourse with men, or have striven hard\nwith Society in terrible irony, without extracting anything from it,\nbefore uttering so strident a cry, and expressing, poor fellow, the\ndesire which satiety of power and of all earthly things has led even\nmonarchs to indulge!\n\nAnd perhaps, too, he went back to solitude to carry out some great work\nthat was floating inchoate in his brain. We would gladly believe it as\nwe read this fragment of his thoughts, betraying the struggle of\nhis soul at the time when youth was ending and the terrible power of\nproduction was coming into being, to which we might have owed the works\nof the man.\n\nThis letter connects itself with the adventure at the theatre. The\nincident and the letter throw light on each other, body and soul were\ntuned to the same pitch. This tempest of doubts and asseverations, of\nclouds and of lightnings that flash before the thunder, ending by a\nstarved yearning for heavenly illumination, throws such a light on the\nthird phase of his education as enables us to understand it perfectly.\nAs we read these lines, written at chance moments, taken up when the\nvicissitudes of life in Paris allowed, may we not fancy that we see\nan oak at that stage of its growth when its inner expansion bursts\nthe tender green bark, covering it with wrinkles and cracks, when its\nmajestic stature is in preparation--if indeed the lightnings of heaven\nand the axe of man shall spare it?\n\nThis letter, then, will close, alike for the poet and the philosopher,\nthis portentous childhood and unappreciated youth. It finishes off the\noutline of this nature in its germ. Philosophers will regret the foliage\nfrost-nipped in the bud; but they will, perhaps, find the flowers\nexpanding in regions far above the highest places of the earth.\n\n\n\n""PARIS, September-October 1819.\n\n  ""DEAR UNCLE,--I shall soon be leaving this part of the world,\n  where I could never bear to live. I find no one here who likes\n  what I like, who works at my work, or is amazed at what amazes me.\n  Thrown back on myself, I eat my heart out in misery. My long and\n  patient study of Society here has brought me to melancholy\n  conclusions, in which doubt predominates.\n\n  ""Here, money is the mainspring of everything. Money is\n  indispensable, even for going without money. But though that dross\n  is necessary to any one who wishes to think in peace, I have not\n  courage enough to make it the sole motive power of my thoughts. To\n  make a fortune, I must take up a profession; in two words, I must,\n  by acquiring some privilege of position or of self-advertisement,\n  either legal or ingeniously contrived, purchase the right of\n  taking day by day out of somebody else\'s purse a certain sum\n  which, by the end of the year, would amount to a small capital;\n  and this, in twenty years, would hardly secure an income of four\n  or five thousand francs to a man who deals honestly. An advocate,\n  a notary, a merchant, any recognized professional, has earned a\n  living for his later days in the course of fifteen or sixteen\n  years after ending his apprenticeship.\n\n  ""But I have never felt fit for work of this kind. I prefer thought\n  to action, an idea to a transaction, contemplation to activity. I\n  am absolutely devoid of the constant attention indispensable to\n  the making of a fortune. Any mercantile venture, any need for\n  using other people\'s money would bring me to grief, and I should\n  be ruined. Though I have nothing, at least at the moment, I owe\n  nothing. The man who gives his life to the achievement of great\n  things in the sphere of intellect, needs very little; still,\n  though twenty sous a day would be enough, I do not possess that\n  small income for my laborious idleness. When I wish to cogitate,\n  want drives me out of the sanctuary where my mind has its being.\n  What is to become of me?\n\n  ""I am not frightened at poverty. If it were not that beggars are\n  imprisoned, branded, scorned, I would beg, to enable me to solve\n  at my leisure the problems that haunt me. Still, this sublime\n  resignation, by which I might emancipate my mind, through\n  abstracting it from the body, would not serve my end. I should\n  still need money to devote myself to certain experiments. But for\n  that, I would accept the outward indigence of a sage possessed of\n  both heaven and heart. A man need only never stoop, to remain\n  lofty in poverty. He who struggles and endures, while marching on\n  to a glorious end, presents a noble spectacle; but who can have\n  the strength to fight here? We can climb cliffs, but it is\n  unendurable to remain for ever tramping the mud. Everything here\n  checks the flight of the spirit that strives towards the future.\n\n  ""I should not be afraid of myself in a desert cave; I am afraid of\n  myself here. In the desert I should be alone with myself,\n  undisturbed; here man has a thousand wants which drag him down.\n  You go out walking, absorbed in dreams; the voice of the beggar\n  asking an alms brings you back to this world of hunger and thirst.\n  You need money only to take a walk. Your organs of sense,\n  perpetually wearied by trifles, never get any rest. The poet\'s\n  sensitive nerves are perpetually shocked, and what ought to be his\n  glory becomes his torment; his imagination is his cruelest enemy.\n  The injured workman, the poor mother in childbed, the prostitute\n  who has fallen ill, the foundling, the infirm and aged--even vice\n  and crime here find a refuge and charity; but the world is\n  merciless to the inventor, to the man who thinks. Here everything\n  must show an immediate and practical result. Fruitless attempts\n  are mocked at, though they may lead to the greatest discoveries;\n  the deep and untiring study that demands long concentrations of\n  every faculty is not valued here. The State might pay talent as it\n  pays the bayonet; but it is afraid of being taken in by mere\n  cleverness, as if genius could be counterfeited for any length of\n  time.\n\n  ""Ah, my dear uncle, when monastic solitude was destroyed, uprooted\n  from its home at the foot of mountains, under green and silent\n  shade, asylums ought to have been provided for those suffering\n  souls who, by an idea, promote the progress of nations or prepare\n  some new and fruitful development of science.\n\n""September 20th.\n\n  ""The love of study brought me hither, as you know. I have met\n  really learned men, amazing for the most part; but the lack of\n  unity in scientific work almost nullifies their efforts. There is\n  no Head of instruction or of scientific research. At the Museum a\n  professor argues to prove that another in the Rue Saint-Jacques\n  talks nonsense. The lecturer at the College of Medicine abuses him\n  of the College de France. When I first arrived, I went to hear an\n  old Academician who taught five hundred youths that Corneille was\n  a haughty and powerful genius; Racine, elegiac and graceful;\n  Moliere, inimitable; Voltaire, supremely witty; Bossuet and\n  Pascal, incomparable in argument. A professor of philosophy may\n  make a name by explaining how Plato is Platonic. Another\n  discourses on the history of words, without troubling himself\n  about ideas. One explains Aeschylus, another tells you that\n  communes were communes, and neither more nor less. These original\n  and brilliant discoveries, diluted to last several hours,\n  constitute the higher education which is to lead to giant strides\n  in human knowledge.\n\n  ""If the Government could have an idea, I should suspect it of\n  being afraid of any real superiority, which, once roused, might\n  bring Society under the yoke of an intelligent rule. Then nations\n  would go too far and too fast; so professors are appointed to\n  produce simpletons. How else can we account for a scheme devoid of\n  method or any notion of the future?\n\n  ""The _Institut_ might be the central government of the moral and\n  intellectual world; but it has been ruined lately by its\n  subdivision into separate academies. So human science marches on,\n  without a guide, without a system, and floats haphazard with no\n  road traced out.\n\n  ""This vagueness and uncertainty prevails in politics as well as in\n  science. In the order of nature means are simple, the end is grand\n  and marvelous; here in science as in government, the means are\n  stupendous, the end is mean. The force which in nature proceeds at\n  an equal pace, and of which the sum is constantly being added to\n  itself--the A + A from which everything is produced--is\n  destructive in society. Politics, at the present time, place human\n  forces in antagonism to neutralize each other, instead of\n  combining them to promote their action to some definite end.\n\n  ""Looking at Europe alone, from Caesar to Constantine, from the\n  puny Constantine to the great Attila, from the Huns to\n  Charlemagne, from Charlemagne to Leo X., from Leo X., to Philip\n  II., from Philip II. to Louis XIV.; from Venice to England, from\n  England to Napoleon, from Napoleon to England, I see no fixed\n  purpose in politics; its constant agitation has led to no\n  progress.\n\n  ""Nations leave witnesses to their greatness in monuments, and to\n  their happiness in the welfare of individuals. Are modern\n  monuments as fine as those of the ancients? I doubt it. The arts,\n  which are the direct outcome of the individual, the products of\n  genius or of handicraft, have not advanced much. The pleasures of\n  Lucullus were as good as those of Samuel Bernard, of Beaujon, or\n  of the King of Bavaria. And then human longevity has diminished.\n\n  ""Thus, to those who will be candid, man is still the same; might\n  is his only law, and success his only wisdom.\n\n  ""Jesus Christ, Mahomet, and Luther only lent a different hue to\n  the arena in which youthful nations disport themselves.\n\n  ""No development of politics has hindered civilization, with its\n  riches, its manners, its alliance of the strong against the weak,\n  its ideas, and its delights, from moving from Memphis to Tyre,\n  from Tyre to Baalbek, from Tadmor to Carthage, from Carthage to\n  Rome, from Rome to Constantinople, from Constantinople to Venice,\n  from Venice to Spain, from Spain to England--while no trace is\n  left of Memphis, of Tyre, of Carthage, of Rome, of Venice, or\n  Madrid. The soul of those great bodies has fled. Not one of them\n  has preserved itself from destruction, nor formulated this axiom:\n  When the effect produced ceases to be in a ratio to its cause,\n  disorganization follows.\n\n  ""The most subtle genius can discover no common bond between great\n  social facts. No political theory has ever lasted. Governments\n  pass away, as men do, without handing down any lesson, and no\n  system gives birth to a system better than that which came before\n  it. What can we say about politics when a Government directly\n  referred to God perished in India and Egypt; when the rule of the\n  Sword and of the Tiara are past; when Monarchy is dying; when the\n  Government of the People has never been alive; when no scheme of\n  intellectual power as applied to material interests has ever\n  proved durable, and everything at this day remains to be done all\n  over again, as it has been at every period when man has turned to\n  cry out, \'I am in torment!\'\n\n  ""The code, which is considered Napoleon\'s greatest achievement, is\n  the most Draconian work I know of. Territorial subdivision carried\n  out to the uttermost, and its principle confirmed by the equal\n  division of property generally, must result in the degeneracy of\n  the nation and the death of the Arts and Sciences. The land, too\n  much broken up, is cultivated only with cereals and small crops;\n  the forests, and consequently the rivers, are disappearing; oxen\n  and horses are no longer bred. Means are lacking both for attack\n  and for resistance. If we should be invaded, the people must be\n  crushed; it has lost its mainspring--its leaders. This is the\n  history of deserts!\n\n  ""Thus the science of politics has no definite principles, and it\n  can have no fixity; it is the spirit of the hour, the perpetual\n  application of strength proportioned to the necessities of the\n  moment. The man who should foresee two centuries ahead would die\n  on the place of execution, loaded with the imprecations of the\n  mob, or else--which seems worse--would be lashed with the myriad\n  whips of ridicule. Nations are but individuals, neither wiser nor\n  stronger than man, and their destinies are identical. If we\n  reflect on man, is not that to consider mankind?\n\n  ""By studying the spectacle of society perpetually storm-tossed in\n  its foundations as well as in its results, in its causes as well\n  as in its actions, while philanthropy is but a splendid mistake,\n  and progress is vanity, I have been confirmed in this truth: Life\n  is within and not without us; to rise above men, to govern them,\n  is only the part of an aggrandized school-master; and those men\n  who are capable of rising to the level whence they can enjoy a\n  view of the world should not look at their own feet.\n\n""November 4th.\n\n  ""I am no doubt occupied with weighty thoughts, I am on the way to\n  certain discoveries, an invincible power bears me toward a\n  luminary which shone at an early age on the darkness of my moral\n  life; but what name can I give to the power that ties my hands and\n  shuts my mouth, and drags me in a direction opposite to my\n  vocation? I must leave Paris, bid farewell to the books in the\n  libraries, those noble centres of illumination, those kindly and\n  always accessible sages, and the younger geniuses with whom I\n  sympathize. Who is it that drives me away? Chance or Providence?\n\n  ""The two ideas represented by those words are irreconcilable. If\n  Chance does not exist, we must admit fatalism, that is to say, the\n  compulsory co-ordination of things under the rule of a general\n  plan. Why then do we rebel? If man is not free, what becomes of\n  the scaffolding of his moral sense? Or, if he can control his\n  destiny, if by his own freewill he can interfere with the\n  execution of the general plan, what becomes of God?\n\n  ""Why did I come here?

I know that a compromise was made by the invention of\n  the Soul; but it is repugnant to me to make God answerable for\n  human baseness, for our disenchantments, our aversions, our\n  degeneracy.\n\n  ""Again, how can we recognize as divine the principle within us\n  which can be overthrown by a few glasses of rum? How conceive of\n  immaterial faculties which matter can conquer, and whose exercise\n  is suspended by a grain of opium? How imagine that we shall be\n  able to feel when we are bereft of the vehicles of sensation? Why\n  must God perish if matter can be proved to think? Is the vitality\n  of matter in its innumerable manifestations--the effect of its\n  instincts--at all more explicable than the effects of the mind? Is\n  not the motion given to the worlds enough to prove God\'s\n  existence, without our plunging into absurd speculations suggested\n  by pride? And if we pass, after our trials, from a perishable\n  state of being to a higher existence, is not that enough for a\n  creature that is distinguished from other creatures only by more\n  perfect instincts? If in moral philosophy there is not a single\n  principle which does not lead to the absurd, or cannot be\n  disproved by evidence, is it not high time that we should set to\n  work to seek such dogmas as are written in the innermost nature of\n  things? Must we not reverse philosophical science?\n\n  ""We trouble ourselves very little about the supposed void that\n  must have pre-existed for us, and we try to fathom the supposed\n  void that lies before us. We make God responsible for the future,\n  but we do not expect Him to account for the past. And yet it is\n  quite as desirable to know whether we have any roots in the past\n  as to discover whether we are inseparable from the future.\n\n  ""We have been Deists or Atheists in one direction only.\n\n  ""Is the world eternal? Was the world created? We can conceive of\n  no middle term between these two propositions; one, then, is true\n  and the other false! Take your choice. Whichever it may be, God,\n  as our reason depicts Him, must be deposed, and that amounts to\n  denial. The world is eternal: then, beyond question, God has had\n  it forced upon Him. The world was created: then God is an\n  impossibility. How could He have subsisted through an eternity,\n  not knowing that He would presently want to create the world? How\n  could He have failed to foresee all the results?\n\n  ""Whence did He derive the essence of creation? Evidently from\n  Himself. If, then, the world proceeds from God, how can you\n  account for evil? That Evil should proceed from Good is absurd. If\n  evil does not exist, what do you make of social life and its laws?\n  On all hands we find a precipice! On every side a gulf in which\n  reason is lost! Then social science must be altogether\n  reconstructed.\n\n  ""Listen to me, uncle; until some splendid genius shall have taken\n  account of the obvious inequality of intellects and the general\n  sense of humanity, the word God will be constantly arraigned, and\n  Society will rest on shifting sands. The secret of the various\n  moral zones through which man passes will be discovered by the\n  analysis of the animal type as a whole. That animal type has\n  hitherto been studied with reference only to its differences, not\n  to its similitudes; in its organic manifestations, not in its\n  faculties. Animal faculties are perfected in direct transmission,\n  in obedience to laws which remain to be discovered. These\n  faculties correspond to the forces which express them, and those\n  forces are essentially material and divisible.\n\n  ""Material faculties! Reflect on this juxtaposition of words. Is\n  not this a problem as insoluble as that of the first communication\n  of motion to matter--an unsounded gulf of which the difficulties\n  were transposed rather than removed by Newton\'s system? Again, the\n  universal assimilation of light by everything that exists on earth\n  demands a new study of our globe. The same animal differs in the\n  tropics of India and in the North. Under the angular or the\n  vertical incidence of the sun\'s rays nature is developed the same,\n  but not the same; identical in its principles, but totally\n  dissimilar in its outcome. The phenomenon that amazes our eyes in\n  the zoological world when we compare the butterflies of Brazil\n  with those of Europe, is even more startling in the world of Mind.\n  A particular facial angle, a certain amount of brain convolutions,\n  are indispensable to produce Columbus, Raphael, Napoleon, Laplace,\n  or Beethoven; the sunless valley produces the cretin--draw your\n  own conclusions. Why such differences, due to the more or less\n  ample diffusion of light to men? The masses of suffering humanity,\n  more or less active, fed, and enlightened, are a difficulty to be\n  accounted for, crying out against God.\n\n  ""Why in great joy do we always want to quit the earth? whence\n  comes the longing to rise which every creature has known or will\n  know? Motion is a great soul, and its alliance with matter is just\n  as difficult to account for as the origin of thought in man. In\n  these days science is one; it is impossible to touch politics\n  independent of moral questions, and these are bound up with\n  scientific questions. It seems to me that we are on the eve of a\n  great human struggle; the forces are there; only I do not see the\n  General.\n\n""November 25.\n\n  ""Believe me, dear uncle, it is hard to give up the life that is in\n  us without a pang. I am returning to Blois with a heavy grip at my\n  heart; I shall die then, taking with me some useful truths. No\n  personal interest debases my regrets. Is earthly fame a guerdon to\n  those who believe that they will mount to a higher sphere?\n\n  ""I am by no means in love with the two syllables _Lam_ and _bert_;\n  whether spoken with respect or with contempt over my grave, they\n  can make no change in my ultimate destiny. I feel myself strong\n  and energetic; I might become a power; I feel in myself a life so\n  luminous that it might enlighten a world, and yet I am shut up in\n  a sort of mineral, as perhaps indeed are the colors you admire on\n  the neck of an Indian bird. I should need to embrace the whole\n  world, to clasp and re-create it; but those who have done this,\n  who have thus embraced and remoulded it began--did they not?--by\n  being a wheel in the machine. I can only be crushed. Mahomet had\n  the sword; Jesus had the cross; I shall die unknown. I shall be at\n  Blois for a day, and then in my coffin.\n\n  ""Do you know why I have come back to Swedenborg after vast studies\n  of all religions, and after proving to myself, by reading all the\n  works published within the last sixty years by the patient\n  English, by Germany, and by France, how deeply true were my\n  youthful views about the Bible? Swedenborg undoubtedly epitomizes\n  all the religions--or rather the one religion--of humanity. Though\n  forms of worship are infinitely various, neither their true\n  meaning nor their metaphysical interpretation has ever varied. In\n  short, man has, and has had, but one religion.\n\n  ""Sivaism, Vishnuism, and Brahmanism, the three primitive creeds,\n  originating as they did in Thibet, in the valley of the Indus, and\n  on the vast plains of the Ganges, ended their warfare some\n  thousand years before the birth of Christ by adopting the Hindoo\n  Trimourti. The Trimourti is our Trinity. From this dogma Magianism\n  arose in Persia; in Egypt, the African beliefs and the Mosaic law;\n  the worship of the Cabiri, and the polytheism of Greece and Rome.\n  While by this ramification of the Trimourti the Asiatic myths\n  became adapted to the imaginations of various races in the lands\n  they reached by the agency of certain sages whom men elevated to\n  be demi-gods--Mithra, Bacchus, Hermes, Hercules, and the rest\n  --Buddha, the great reformer of the three primeval religions, lived\n  in India, and founded his Church there, a sect which still numbers\n  two hundred millions more believers than Christianity can show,\n  while it certainly influenced the powerful Will both of Jesus and\n  of Confucius.\n\n  ""Then Christianity raised her standard. Subsequently Mahomet fused\n  Judaism and Christianity, the Bible and the Gospel, in one book,\n  the Koran, adapting them to the apprehension of the Arab race.\n  Finally, Swedenborg borrowed from Magianism, Brahmanism, Buddhism,\n  and Christian mysticism all the truth and divine beauty that those\n  four great religious books hold in common, and added to them a\n  doctrine, a basis of reasoning, that may be termed mathematical.\n\n  ""Any man who plunges into these religious waters, of which the\n  sources are not all known, will find proofs that Zoroaster, Moses,\n  Buddha, Confucius, Jesus Christ, and Swedenborg had identical\n  principles and aimed at identical ends.\n\n  ""The last of them all, Swedenborg, will perhaps be the Buddha of\n  the North. Obscure and diffuse as his writings are, we find in\n  them the elements of a magnificent conception of society. His\n  Theocracy is sublime, and his creed is the only acceptable one to\n  superior souls. He alone brings man into immediate communion with\n  God, he gives a thirst for God, he has freed the majesty of God\n  from the trappings in which other human dogmas have disguised Him.\n  He left Him where He is, making His myriad creations and creatures\n  gravitate towards Him through successive transformations which\n  promise a more immediate and more natural future than the Catholic\n  idea of Eternity. Swedenborg has absolved God from the reproach\n  attaching to Him in the estimation of tender souls for the\n  perpetuity of revenge to punish the sin of a moment--a system of\n  injustice and cruelty.\n\n  ""Each man may know for himself what hope he has of life eternal,\n  and whether this world has any rational sense. I mean to make the\n  attempt. And this attempt may save the world, just as much as the\n  cross at Jerusalem or the sword at Mecca. These were both the\n  offspring of the desert. Of the thirty-three years of Christ\'s\n  life, we only know the history of nine; His life of seclusion\n  prepared Him for His life of glory. And I too crave for the\n  desert!""\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the difficulties of the task, I have felt it my duty to\ndepict Lambert\'s boyhood, the unknown life to which I owe the only happy\nhours, the only pleasant memories, of my early days. Excepting during\nthose two years I had nothing but annoyances and weariness. Though some\nhappiness was mine at a later time, it was always incomplete.\n\nI have been diffuse, I know; but in default of entering into the whole\nwide heart and brain of Louis Lambert--two words which inadequately\nexpress the infinite aspects of his inner life--it would be almost\nimpossible to make the second part of his intellectual history\nintelligible--a phase that was unknown to the world and to me, but of\nwhich the mystical outcome was made evident to my eyes in the course\nof a few hours. Those who have not already dropped this volume, will, I\nhope, understand the events I still have to tell, forming as they do\na sort of second existence lived by this creature--may I not say this\ncreation?--in whom everything was to be so extraordinary, even his end.\n\n\n\nWhen Louis returned to Blois, his uncle was eager to procure him some\namusement; but the poor priest was regarded as a perfect leper in that\ngodly-minded town. No one would have anything to say to a revolutionary\nwho had taken the oaths. His society, therefore, consisted of a\nfew individuals of what were then called liberal or patriotic, or\nconstitutional opinions, on whom he would call for a rubber of whist or\nof boston.\n\nAt the first house where he was introduced by his uncle, Louis met a\nyoung lady, whose circumstances obliged her to remain in this circle, so\ncontemned by those of the fashionable world, though her fortune was such\nas to make it probable that she might by and by marry into the highest\naristocracy of the province. Mademoiselle Pauline de Villenoix was sole\nheiress to the wealth amassed by her grandfather, a Jew named Salomon,\nwho, contrary to the customs of his nation, had, in his old age, married\na Christian and a Catholic. He had only one son, who was brought up in\nhis mother\'s faith. At his father\'s death young Salomon purchased what\nwas known at that time as a _savonnette a vilain_ (literally _a cake of\nsoap for a serf_), a small estate called Villenoix, which he contrived\nto get registered with a baronial title, and took its name. He died\nunmarried, but he left a natural daughter, to whom he bequeathed the\ngreater part of his fortune, including the lands of Villenoix. He\nappointed one of his uncles, Monsieur Joseph Salomon, to be the girl\'s\nguardian. The old Jew was so devoted to his ward that he seemed\nwilling to make great sacrifices for the sake of marrying her well. But\nMademoiselle de Villenoix\'s birth, and the cherished prejudice against\nJews that prevails in the provinces, would not allow of her being\nreceived in the very exclusive circle which, rightly or wrongly,\nconsiders itself noble, notwithstanding her own large fortune and her\nguardian\'s.\n\nMonsieur Joseph Salomon was resolved that if she could not secure\na country squire, his niece should go to Paris and make choice of\na husband among the peers of France, liberal or monarchical; as to\nhappiness, that he believed he could secure her by the terms of the\nmarriage contract.\n\nMademoiselle de Villenoix was now twenty. Her remarkable beauty and\ngifts of mind were surer guarantees of happiness than those offered by\nmoney. Her features were of the purest type of Jewish beauty; the oval\nlines, so noble and maidenly, have an indescribable stamp of the ideal,\nand seem to speak of the joys of the East, its unchangeably blue sky,\nthe glories of its lands, and the fabulous riches of life there. She had\nfine eyes, shaded by deep eyelids, fringed with thick, curled lashes.\nBiblical innocence sat on her brow. Her complexion was of the\npure whiteness of the Levite\'s robe. She was habitually silent and\nthoughtful, but her movements and gestures betrayed a quiet grace, as\nher speech bore witness to a woman\'s sweet and loving nature. She had\nnot, indeed, the rosy freshness, the fruit-like bloom which blush on a\ngirl\'s cheek during her careless years. Darker shadows, with here\nand there a redder vein, took the place of color, symptomatic of an\nenergetic temper and nervous irritability, such as many men do not like\nto meet with in a wife, while to others they are an indication of the\nmost sensitive chastity and passion mingled with pride.\n\nAs soon as Louis saw Mademoiselle de Villenoix, he discerned the angel\nwithin. The richest powers of his soul, and his tendency to ecstatic\nreverie, every faculty within him was at once concentrated in boundless\nlove, the first love of a young man, a passion which is strong indeed in\nall, but which in him was raised to incalculable power by the perennial\nardor of his senses, the character of his ideas, and the manner in which\nhe lived. This passion became a gulf, into which the hapless fellow\nthrew everything; a gulf whither the mind dare not venture, since his,\nflexible and firm as it was, was lost there. There all was mysterious,\nfor everything went on in that moral world, closed to most men, whose\nlaws were revealed to him--perhaps to his sorrow.\n\nWhen an accident threw me in the way of his uncle, the good man showed\nme into the room which Lambert had at that time lived in. I wanted to\nfind some vestiges of his writings, if he should have left any. There\namong his papers, untouched by the old man from that fine instinct of\ngrief that characterized the aged, I found a number of letters, too\nillegible ever to have been sent to Mademoiselle de Villenoix. My\nfamiliarity with Lambert\'s writing enabled me in time to decipher the\nhieroglyphics of this shorthand, the result of impatience and a frenzy\nof passion. Carried away by his feelings, he had written without being\nconscious of the irregularity of words too slow to express his thoughts.\nHe must have been compelled to copy these chaotic attempts, for the\nlines often ran into each other; but he was also afraid perhaps of not\nhaving sufficiently disguised his feelings, and at first, at any rate,\nhe had probably written his love-letters twice over.\n\nIt required all the fervency of my devotion to his memory, and the sort\nof fanaticism which comes of such a task, to enable me to divine\nand restore the meaning of the five letters that here follow. These\ndocuments, preserved by me with pious care, are the only material\nevidence of his overmastering passion. Mademoiselle de Villenoix had no\ndoubt destroyed the real letters that she received, eloquent witnesses\nto the delirium she inspired.\n\nThe first of these papers, evidently a rough sketch, betrays by its\nstyle and by its length the many emendations, the heartfelt alarms,\nthe innumerable terrors caused by a desire to please; the changes of\nexpression and the hesitation between the whirl of ideas that beset a\nman as he indites his first love-letter--a letter he never will forget,\neach line the result of a reverie, each word the subject of long\ncogitation, while the most unbridled passion known to man feels the\nnecessity of the most reserved utterance, and like a giant stooping to\nenter a hovel, speaks humbly and low, so as not to alarm a girl\'s soul.\n\nNo antiquary ever handled his palimpsests with greater respect than\nI showed in reconstructing these mutilated documents of such joy and\nsuffering as must always be sacred to those who have known similar joy\nand grief.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n\n  ""Mademoiselle, when you have read this letter, if you ever should\n  read it, my life will be in your hands, for I love you; and to me,\n  the hope of being loved is life. Others, perhaps, ere now, have,\n  in speaking of themselves, misused the words I must employ to\n  depict the state of my soul; yet, I beseech you to believe in the\n  truth of my expressions; though weak, they are sincere. Perhaps I\n  ought not thus to proclaim my love. Indeed, my heart counseled me\n  to wait in silence till my passion should touch you, that I might\n  the better conceal it if its silent demonstrations should\n  displease you; or till I could express it even more delicately\n  than in words if I found favor in your eyes. However, after having\n  listened for long to the coy fears that fill a youthful heart with\n  alarms, I write in obedience to the instinct which drags useless\n  lamentations from the dying.\n\n  ""It has needed all my courage to silence the pride of poverty, and\n  to overleap the barriers which prejudice erects between you and\n  me. I have had to smother many reflections to love you in spite of\n  your wealth; and as I write to you, am I not in danger of the\n  scorn which women often reserve for profession of love, which they\n  accept only as one more tribute of flattery? But we cannot help\n  rushing with all our might towards happiness, or being attracted\n  to the life of love as a plant is to the light; we must have been\n  very unhappy before we can conquer the torment, the anguish of\n  those secret deliberations when reason proves to us by a thousand\n  arguments how barren our yearning must be if it remains buried in\n  our hearts, and when hopes bid us dare everything.\n\n  ""I was happy when I admired you in silence; I was so lost in the\n  contemplation of your beautiful soul, that only to see you left me\n  hardly anything further to imagine. And I should not now have\n  dared to address you if I had not heard that you were leaving.\n  What misery has that one word brought upon me! Indeed, it is my\n  despair that has shown me the extent of my attachment--it is\n  unbounded. Mademoiselle, you will never know--at least, I hope you\n  may never know--the anguish of dreading lest you should lose the\n  only happiness that has dawned on you on earth, the only thing\n  that has thrown a gleam of light in the darkness of misery. I\n  understood yesterday that my life was no more in myself, but in\n  you. There is but one woman in the world for me, as there is but\n  one thought in my soul. I dare not tell you to what a state I am\n  reduced by my love for you. I would have you only as a gift from\n  yourself; I must therefore avoid showing myself to you in all the\n  attractiveness of dejection--for is it not often more impressive\n  to a noble soul than that of good fortune? There are many things I\n  may not tell you. Indeed, I have too lofty a notion of love to\n  taint it with ideas that are alien to its nature. If my soul is\n  worthy of yours, and my life pure, your heart will have a\n  sympathetic insight, and you will understand me!\n\n  ""It is the fate of man to offer himself to the woman who can make\n  him believe in happiness; but it is your prerogative to reject the\n  truest passion if it is not in harmony with the vague voices in\n  your heart--that I know. If my lot, as decided by you, must be\n  adverse to my hopes, mademoiselle, let me appeal to the delicacy\n  of your maiden soul and the ingenuous compassion of a woman to\n  burn my letter. On my knees I beseech you to forget all! Do not\n  mock at a feeling that is wholly respectful, and that is too\n  deeply graven on my heart ever to be effaced. Break my heart, but\n  do not rend it! Let the expression of my first love, a pure and\n  youthful love, be lost in your pure and youthful heart! Let it die\n  there as a prayer rises up to die in the bosom of God!\n\n  ""I owe you much gratitude: I have spent delicious hours occupied\n  in watching you, and giving myself up to the faint dreams of my\n  life; do not crush these long but transient joys by some girlish\n  irony. Be satisfied not to answer me. I shall know how to\n  interpret your silence; you will see me no more. If I must be\n  condemned to know for ever what happiness means, and to be for\n  ever bereft of it; if, like a banished angel, I am to cherish the\n  sense of celestial joys while bound for ever to a world of sorrow\n  --well, I can keep the secret of my love as well as that of my\n  griefs.--And farewell!\n\n  ""Yes, I resign you to God, to whom I will pray for you, beseeching\n  Him to grant you a happy life; for even if I am driven from your\n  heart, into which I have crept by stealth, still I shall ever be\n  near you. Otherwise, of what value would the sacred words be of\n  this letter, my first and perhaps my last entreaty? If I should\n  ever cease to think of you, to love you whether in happiness or in\n  woe, should I not deserve my punishment?""\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n  ""You are not going away! And I am loved! I, a poor, insignificant\n  creature! My beloved Pauline, you do not yourself know the power\n  of the look I believe in, the look you gave me to tell me that you\n  had chosen me--you so young and lovely, with the world at your\n  feet!\n\n  ""To enable you to understand my happiness, I should have to give\n  you a history of my life. If you had rejected me, all was over for\n  me. I have suffered too much. Yes, my love for you, my comforting\n  and stupendous love, was a last effort of yearning for the\n  happiness my soul strove to reach--a soul crushed by fruitless\n  labor, consumed by fears that make me doubt myself, eaten into by\n  despair which has often urged me to die. No one in the world can\n  conceive of the terrors my fateful imagination inflicts on me. It\n  often bears me up to the sky, and suddenly flings me to earth\n  again from prodigious heights. Deep-seated rushes of power, or\n  some rare and subtle instance of peculiar lucidity, assure me now\n  and then that I am capable of great things. Then I embrace the\n  universe in my mind, I knead, shape it, inform it, I comprehend it\n  --or fancy that I do; then suddenly I awake--alone, sunk in\n  blackest night, helpless and weak; I forget the light I saw but\n  now, I find no succor; above all, there is no heart where I may\n  take refuge.\n\n  ""This distress of my inner life affects my physical existence. The\n  nature of my character gives me over to the raptures of happiness\n  as defenceless as when the fearful light of reflection comes to\n  analyze and demolish them. Gifted as I am with the melancholy\n  faculty of seeing obstacles and success with equal clearness,\n  according to the mood of the moment, I am happy or miserable by\n  turns.\n\n  ""Thus, when I first met you, I felt the presence of an angelic\n  nature, I breathed an air that was sweet to my burning breast, I\n  heard in my soul the voice that never can be false, telling me\n  that here was happiness; but perceiving all the barriers that\n  divided us, I understood the vastness of their pettiness, and\n  these difficulties terrified me more than the prospect of\n  happiness could delight me. At once I felt the awful reaction\n  which casts my expansive soul back on itself; the smile you had\n  brought to my lips suddenly turned to a bitter grimace, and I\n  could only strive to keep calm, while my soul was boiling with the\n  turmoil of contradictory emotions. In short, I experienced that\n  gnawing pang to which twenty-three years of suppressed sighs and\n  betrayed affections have not inured me.\n\n  ""Well, Pauline, the look by which you promised that I should be\n  happy suddenly warmed my vitality, and turned all my sorrows into\n  joy. Now, I could wish that I had suffered more. My love is\n  suddenly full-grown. My soul was a wide territory that lacked the\n  blessing of sunshine, and your eyes have shed light on it. Beloved\n  providence! you will be all in all to me, orphan as I am, without\n  a relation but my uncle. You will be my whole family, as you are\n  my whole wealth, nay, the whole world to me. Have you not bestowed\n  on me every gladness man can desire in that chaste--lavish--timid\n  glance?\n\n  ""You have given me incredible self-confidence and audacity. I can\n  dare all things now. I came back to Blois in deep dejection. Five\n  years of study in the heart of Paris had made me look on the world\n  as a prison. I had conceived of vast schemes, and dared not speak\n  of them. Fame seemed to me a prize for charlatans, to which a\n  really noble spirit should not stoop. Thus, my ideas could only\n  make their way by the assistance of a man bold enough to mount the\n  platform of the press, and to harangue loudly the simpletons he\n  scorns. This kind of courage I have not. I ploughed my way on,\n  crushed by the verdict of the crowd, in despair at never making it\n  hear me. I was at once too humble and too lofty! I swallowed my\n  thoughts as other men swallow humiliations. I had even come to\n  despise knowledge, blaming it for yielding no real happiness.\n\n  ""But since yesterday I am wholly changed. For your sake I now\n  covet every palm of glory, every triumph of success. When I lay my\n  head on your knees, I could wish to attract to you the eyes of the\n  whole world, just as I long to concentrate in my love every idea,\n  every power that is in me. The most splendid celebrity is a\n  possession that genius alone can create. Well, I can, at my will,\n  make for you a bed of laurels. And if the silent ovation paid to\n  science is not all you desire, I have within me the sword of the\n  Word; I could run in the path of honor and ambition where others\n  only crawl.\n\n  ""Command me, Pauline; I will be whatever you will. My iron will\n  can do anything--I am loved! Armed with that thought, ought not a\n  man to sweep everything before him? The man who wants all can do\n  all. If you are the prize of success, I enter the lists to-morrow.\n  To win such a look as that you bestowed on me, I would leap the\n  deepest abyss. Through you I understand the fabulous achievements\n  of chivalry and the most fantastic tales of the _Arabian Nights_.\n  I can believe now in the most fantastic excesses of love, and in\n  the success of a prisoner\'s wildest attempt to recover his\n  liberty. You have aroused the thousand virtues that lay dormant\n  within me--patience, resignation, all the powers of my heart, all\n  the strength of my soul. I live by you and--heavenly thought!--for\n  you. Everything now has a meaning for me in life. I understand\n  everything, even the vanities of wealth.\n\n  ""I find myself shedding all the pearls of the Indies at your feet;\n  I fancy you reclining either on the rarest flowers, or on the\n  softest tissues, and all the splendor of the world seems hardly\n  worthy of you, for whom I would I could command the harmony and\n  the light that are given out by the harps of seraphs and the stars\n  of heaven! Alas! a poor, studious poet, I offer you in words\n  treasures I cannot bestow; I can only give you my heart, in which\n  you reign for ever. I have nothing else. But are there no\n  treasures in eternal gratitude, in a smile whose expressions will\n  perpetually vary with perennial happiness, under the constant\n  eagerness of my devotion to guess the wishes of your loving soul?\n  Has not one celestial glance given us assurance of always\n  understanding each other?\n\n  ""I have a prayer now to be said to God every night--a prayer full\n  of you: \'Let my Pauline be happy!\' And will you fill all my days\n  as you now fill my heart?\n\n  ""Farewell, I can but trust you to God alone!""\n\n\n\n                                 III\n\n  ""Pauline! tell me if I can in any way have displeased you\n  yesterday? Throw off the pride of heart which inflicts on me the\n  secret tortures that can be caused by one we love. Scold me if you\n  will! Since yesterday, a vague, unutterable dread of having\n  offended you pours grief on the life of feeling which you had made\n  so sweet and so rich. The lightest veil that comes between two\n  souls sometimes grows to be a brazen wall. There are no venial\n  crimes in love! If you have the very spirit of that noble\n  sentiment, you must feel all its pangs, and we must be unceasingly\n  careful not to fret each other by some heedless word.\n\n  ""No doubt, my beloved treasure, if there is any fault, it is in\n  me. I cannot pride myself in the belief that I understand a\n  woman\'s heart, in all the expansion of its tenderness, all the\n  grace of its devotedness; but I will always endeavor to appreciate\n  the value of what you vouchsafe to show me of the secrets of\n  yours.\n\n  ""Speak to me! Answer me soon! The melancholy into which we are\n  thrown by the idea of a wrong done is frightful; it casts a shroud\n  over life, and doubts on everything.\n\n  ""I spent this morning sitting on the bank by the sunken road,\n  gazing at the turrets of Villenoix, not daring to go to our hedge.\n  If you could imagine all I saw in my soul! What gloomy visions\n  passed before me under the gray sky, whose cold sheen added to my\n  dreary mood! I had dark presentiments! I was terrified lest I\n  should fail to make you happy.\n\n  ""I must tell you everything, my dear Pauline. There are moments\n  when the spirit of vitality seems to abandon me. I feel bereft of\n  all strength. Everything is a burden to me; every fibre of my body\n  is inert, every sense is flaccid, my sight grows dim, my tongue is\n  paralyzed, my imagination is extinct, desire is dead--nothing\n  survives but my mere human vitality. At such times, though you\n  were in all the splendor of your beauty, though you should lavish\n  on me your subtlest smiles and tenderest words, an evil influence\n  would blind me, and distort the most ravishing melody into\n  discordant sounds. At those times--as I believe--some\n  argumentative demon stands before me, showing me the void beneath\n  the most real possessions. This pitiless demon mows down every\n  flower, and mocks at the sweetest feelings, saying: \'Well--and\n  then?\' He mars the fairest work by showing me its skeleton, and\n  reveals the mechanism of things while hiding the beautiful\n  results.\n\n  ""At those terrible moments, when the evil spirit takes possession\n  of me, when the divine light is darkened in my soul without my\n  knowing the cause, I sit in grief and anguish, I wish myself deaf\n  and dumb, I long for death to give me rest. These hours of doubt\n  and uneasiness are perhaps inevitable; at any rate, they teach me\n  not to be proud after the flights which have borne me to the skies\n  where I have gathered a full harvest of thoughts; for it is always\n  after some long excursion in the vast fields of the intellect, and\n  after the most luminous speculations, that I tumble, broken and\n  weary, into this limbo. At such a moment, my angel, a wife would\n  double my love for her--at any rate, she might. If she were\n  capricious, ailing, or depressed, she would need the comforting\n  overflow of ingenious affection, and I should not have a glance to\n  bestow on her. It is my shame, Pauline, to have to tell you that\n  at times I could weep with you, but that nothing could make me\n  smile.\n\n  ""A woman can always conceal her troubles; for her child, or for\n  the man she loves, she can laugh in the midst of suffering. And\n  could not I, for you, Pauline, imitate the exquisite reserve of a\n  woman? Since yesterday I have doubted my own power. If I could\n  displease you once, if I failed once to understand you, I dread\n  lest I should often be carried out of our happy circle by my evil\n  demon. Supposing I were to have many of those dreadful moods, or\n  that my unbounded love could not make up for the dark hours of my\n  life--that I were doomed to remain such as I am?--Fatal doubts!\n\n  ""Power is indeed a fatal possession if what I feel within me is\n  power. Pauline, go! Leave me, desert me! Sooner would I endure\n  every ill in life than endure the misery of knowing that you were\n  unhappy through me.\n\n  ""But, perhaps, the demon has had such empire over me only because\n  I have had no gentle, white hands about me to drive him off. No\n  woman has ever shed on me the balm of her affection; and I know\n  not whether, if love should wave his pinions over my head in these\n  moments of exhaustion, new strength might not be given to my\n  spirit. This terrible melancholy is perhaps a result of my\n  isolation, one of the torments of a lonely soul which pays for its\n  hidden treasures with groans and unknown suffering. Those who\n  enjoy little shall suffer little; immense happiness entails\n  unutterable anguish!\n\n  ""How terrible a doom! If it be so, must we not shudder for\n  ourselves, we who are superhumanly happy? If nature sells us\n  everything at its true value, into what pit are we not fated to\n  fall? Ah! the most fortunate lovers are those who die together in\n  the midst of their youth and love! How sad it all is! Does my soul\n  foresee evil in the future? I examine myself, wondering whether\n  there is anything in me that can cause you a moment\'s anxiety. I\n  love you too selfishly perhaps? I shall be laying on your beloved\n  head a burden heavy out of all proportion to the joy my love can\n  bring to your heart. If there dwells in me some inexorable power\n  which I must obey--if I am compelled to curse when you pray, if\n  some dark thought coerces me when I would fain kneel at your feet\n  and play as a child, will you not be jealous of that wayward and\n  tricky spirit?\n\n  ""You understand, dearest heart, that what I dread is not being\n  wholly yours; that I would gladly forego all the sceptres and the\n  palms of the world to enshrine you in one eternal thought, to see\n  a perfect life and an exquisite poem in our rapturous love; to\n  throw my soul into it, drown my powers, and wring from each hour\n  the joys it has to give!\n\n  ""Ah, my memories of love are crowding back upon me, the clouds of\n  despair will lift. Farewell. I leave you now to be more entirely\n  yours. My beloved soul, I look for a line, a word that may restore\n  my peace of mind. Let me know whether I really grieved my Pauline,\n  or whether some uncertain expression of her countenance misled me.\n  I could not bear to have to reproach myself after a whole life of\n  happiness, for ever having met you without a smile of love, a\n  honeyed word. To grieve the woman I love--Pauline, I should count\n  it a crime. Tell me the truth, do not put me off with some\n  magnanimous subterfuge, but forgive me without cruelty.""\n\n\n\nFRAGMENT.\n\n  ""Is so perfect an attachment happiness? Yes, for years of\n  suffering would not pay for an hour of love.\n\n  ""Yesterday, your sadness, as I suppose, passed into my soul as\n  swiftly as a shadow falls. Were you sad or suffering? I was\n  wretched. Whence came my distress? Write to me at once. Why did I\n  not know it? We are not yet completely one in mind. At two\n  leagues\' distance or at a thousand I ought to feel your pain and\n  sorrows. I shall not believe that I love you till my life is so\n  bound up with yours that our life is one, till our hearts, our\n  thoughts are one. I must be where you are, see what you feel, feel\n  what you feel, be with you in thought. Did not I know, at once,\n  that your carriage had been overthrown and you were bruised? But\n  on that day I had been with you, I had never left you, I could see\n  you. When my uncle asked me what made me turn so pale, I answered\n  at once, \'Mademoiselle de Villenoix had has a fall.\'\n\n  ""Why, then, yesterday, did I fail to read your soul? Did you wish\n  to hide the cause of your grief? However, I fancied I could feel\n  that you were arguing in my favor, though in vain, with that\n  dreadful Salomon, who freezes my blood. That man is not of our\n  heaven.\n\n  ""Why do you insist that our happiness, which has no resemblance to\n  that of other people, should conform to the laws of the world? And\n  yet I delight too much in your bashfulness, your religion, your\n  superstitions, not to obey your lightest whim. What you do must be\n  right; nothing can be purer than your mind, as nothing is lovelier\n  than your face, which reflects your divine soul.\n\n  ""I shall wait for a letter before going along the lanes to meet\n  the sweet hour you grant me. Oh! if you could know how the sight\n  of those turrets makes my heart throb when I see them edged with\n  light by the moon, our only confidante.""\n\n\n\n                                  IV\n\n  ""Farewell to glory, farewell to the future, to the life I had\n  dreamed of! Now, my well-beloved, my glory is that I am yours, and\n  worthy of you; my future lies entirely in the hope of seeing you;\n  and is not my life summed up in sitting at your feet, in lying\n  under your eyes, in drawing deep breaths in the heaven you have\n  created for me? All my powers, all my thoughts must be yours,\n  since you could speak those thrilling words, \'Your sufferings must\n  be mine!\' Should I not be stealing some joys from love, some\n  moments from happiness, some experiences from your divine spirit,\n  if I gave my hours to study--ideas to the world and poems to the\n  poets? Nay, nay, my very life, I will treasure everything for you;\n  I will bring to you every flower of my soul. Is there anything\n  fine enough, splendid enough, in all the resources of the world,\n  or of intellect, to do honor to a heart so rich, so pure as yours\n  --the heart to which I dare now and again to unite my own? Yes,\n  now and again, I dare believe that I can love as much as you do.\n\n  ""And yet, no; you are the angel-woman; there will always be a\n  greater charm in the expression of your feelings, more harmony in\n  your voice, more grace in your smile, more purity in your looks\n  than in mine. Let me feel that you are the creature of a higher\n  sphere than that I live in; it will be your pride to have\n  descended from it; mine, that I should have deserved you; and you\n  will not perhaps have fallen too far by coming down to me in my\n  poverty and misery. Nay, if a woman\'s most glorious refuge is in a\n  heart that is wholly her own, you will always reign supreme in\n  mine. Not a thought, not a deed, shall ever pollute this heart,\n  this glorious sanctuary, so long as you vouchsafe to dwell in it\n  --and will you not dwell in it for ever? Did you not enchant me by\n  the words, \'Now and for ever?\' _Nunc et semper_! And I have\n  written these words of our ritual below your portrait--words\n  worthy of you, as they are of God. He is _nunc et semper_, as my\n  love is.\n\n  ""Never, no, never, can I exhaust that which is immense, infinite,\n  unbounded--and such is the feeling I have for you; I have imagined\n  its immeasurable extent, as we measure space by the dimensions of\n  one of its parts. I have had ineffable joys, whole hours filled\n  with delicious meditation, as I have recalled a single gesture or\n  the tone of a word of yours. Thus there will be memories of which\n  the magnitude will overpower me, if the reminiscence of a sweet\n  and friendly interview is enough to make me shed tears of joy, to\n  move and thrill my soul, and to be an inexhaustible wellspring of\n  gladness. Love is the life of angels!\n\n  ""I can never, I believe, exhaust my joy in seeing you. This\n  rapture, the least fervid of any, though it never can last long\n  enough, has made me apprehend the eternal contemplation in which\n  seraphs and spirits abide in the presence of God; nothing can be\n  more natural, if from His essence there emanates a light as\n  fruitful of new emotions as that of your eyes is, of your imposing\n  brow, and your beautiful countenance--the image of your soul.\n  Then, the soul, our second self, whose pure form can never perish,\n  makes our love immortal. I would there were some other language\n  than that I use to express to you the ever-new ecstasy of my love;\n  but since there is one of our own creating, since our looks are\n  living speech, must we not meet face to face to read in each\n  other\'s eyes those questions and answers from the heart, that are\n  so living, so penetrating, that one evening you could say to me,\n  \'Be silent!\' when I was not speaking. Do you remember it, dear\n  life?\n\n  ""When I am away from you in the darkness of absence, am I not\n  reduced to use human words, too feeble to express heavenly\n  feelings? But words at any rate represent the marks these feelings\n  leave in my soul, just as the word _God_ imperfectly sums up the\n  notions we form of that mysterious First Cause. But, in spite of\n  the subtleties and infinite variety of language, I have no words\n  that can express to you the exquisite union by which my life is\n  merged into yours whenever I think of you.\n\n  ""And with what word can I conclude when I cease writing to you,\n  and yet do not part from you? What can _farewell_ mean, unless in\n  death? But is death a farewell? Would not my spirit be then more\n  closely one with yours? Ah! my first and last thought; formerly I\n  offered you my heart and life on my knees; now what fresh blossoms\n  of feelings can I discover in my soul that I have not already\n  given you? It would be a gift of a part of what is wholly yours.\n\n  ""Are you my future? How deeply I regret the past! I would I could\n  have back all the years that are ours no more, and give them to\n  you to reign over, as you do over my present life. What indeed was\n  that time when I knew you not? It would be a void but that I was\n  so wretched.""\n\n\n\nFRAGMENT.\n\n  ""Beloved angel, how delightful last evening was! How full of\n  riches your dear heart is! And is your love endless, like mine?\n  Each word brought me fresh joy, and each look made it deeper. The\n  placid expression of your countenance gave our thoughts a\n  limitless horizon. It was all as infinite as the sky, and as bland\n  as its blue. The refinement of your adored features repeated\n  itself by some inexplicable magic in your pretty movements and\n  your least gestures. I knew that you were all graciousness, all\n  love, but I did not know how variously graceful you could be.\n  Everything combined to urge me to tender solicitation, to make me\n  ask the first kiss that a woman always refuses, no doubt that it\n  may be snatched from her. You, dear soul of my life, will never\n  guess beforehand what you may grant to my love, and will yield\n  perhaps without knowing it! You are utterly true, and obey your\n  heart alone.\n\n  ""The sweet tones of your voice blended with the tender harmonies\n  that filled the quiet air, the cloudless sky. Not a bird piped,\n  not a breeze whispered--solitude, you, and I. The motionless\n  leaves did not quiver in the beautiful sunset hues which are both\n  light and shadow. You felt that heavenly poetry--you who\n  experienced so many various emotions, and who so often raised your\n  eyes to heaven to avoid answering me. You who are proud and saucy,\n  humble and masterful, who give yourself to me so completely in\n  spirit and in thought, and evade the most bashful caress. Dear\n  witcheries of the heart! They ring in my ears; they sound and play\n  there still. Sweet words but half spoken, like a child\'s speech,\n  neither promise nor confession, but allowing love to cherish its\n  fairest hopes without fear or torment! How pure a memory for life!\n  What a free blossoming of all the flowers that spring from the\n  soul, which a mere trifle can blight, but which, at that moment,\n  everything warmed and expanded.\n\n  ""And it will always be so, will it not, my beloved? As I recall,\n  this morning, the fresh and living delights revealed to me in that\n  hour, I am conscious of a joy which makes me conceive of true love\n  as an ocean of everlasting and ever-new experiences, into which we\n  may plunge with increasing delight. Every day, every word, every\n  kiss, every glance, must increase it by its tribute of past\n  happiness. Hearts that are large enough never to forget must live\n  every moment in their past joys as much as in those promised by\n  the future. This was my dream of old, and now it is no longer a\n  dream! Have I not met on this earth with an angel who had made me\n  know all its happiness, as a reward, perhaps, for having endured\n  all its torments? Angel of heaven, I salute thee with a kiss.\n\n  ""I shall send you this hymn of thanksgiving from my heart, I owe\n  it to you; but it can hardly express my gratitude or the morning\n  worship my heart offers up day by day to her who epitomized the\n  whole gospel of the heart in this divine word: \'Believe.\'""\n\n\n\n                               V\n\n  ""What! no further difficulties, dearest heart! We shall be free to\n  belong to each other every day, every hour, every minute, and for\n  ever! We may be as happy for all the days of our life as we now\n  are by stealth, at rare intervals! Our pure, deep feelings will\n  assume the expression of the thousand fond acts I have dreamed of.\n  For me your little foot will be bared, you will be wholly mine!\n  Such happiness kills me; it is too much for me. My head is too\n  weak, it will burst with the vehemence of my ideas. I cry and I\n  laugh--I am possessed! Every joy is an arrow of flame; it pierces\n  and burns me. In fancy you rise before my eyes, ravished and\n  dazzled by numberless and capricious images of delight.\n\n  ""In short, our whole future life is before me--its torrents, its\n  still places, its joys; it seethes, it flows on, it lies sleeping;\n  then again it awakes fresh and young. I see myself and you side by\n  side, walking with equal pace, living in the same thought; each\n  dwelling in each other\'s heart, understanding each other,\n  responding to each other as an echo catches and repeats a sound\n  across wide distances.\n\n  ""Can life be long when it is thus consumed hour by hour? Shall we\n  not die in a first embrace? What if our souls have already met in\n  that sweet evening kiss which almost overpowered us--a feeling\n  kiss, but the crown of my hopes, the ineffectual expression of all\n  the prayers I breathe while we are apart, hidden in my soul like\n  remorse?\n\n  ""I, who would creep back and hide in the hedge only to hear your\n  footsteps as you went homewards--I may henceforth admire you at my\n  leisure, see you busy, moving, smiling, prattling! An endless joy!\n  You cannot imagine all the gladness it is to me to see you going\n  and coming; only a man can know that deep delight. Your least\n  movement gives me greater pleasure than a mother even can feel as\n  she sees her child asleep or at play. I love you with every kind\n  of love in one. The grace of your least gesture is always new to\n  me. I fancy I could spend whole nights breathing your breath; I\n  would I could steal into every detail of your life, be the very\n  substance of your thoughts--be your very self.\n\n  ""Well, we shall, at any rate, never part again! No human alloy\n  shall ever disturb our love, infinite in its phases and as pure as\n  all things are which are One--our love, vast as the sea, vast as\n  the sky! You are mine! all mine! I may look into the depths of\n  your eyes to read the sweet soul that alternately hides and shines\n  there, to anticipate your wishes.\n\n  ""My best-beloved, listen to some things I have never yet dared to\n  tell you, but which I may confess to you now. I felt a certain\n  bashfulness of soul which hindered the full expression of my\n  feelings, so I strove to shroud them under the garbs of thoughts.\n  But now I long to lay my heart bare before you, to tell you of the\n  ardor of my dreams, to reveal the boiling demands of my senses,\n  excited, no doubt, by the solitude in which I have lived,\n  perpetually fired by conceptions of happiness, and aroused by you,\n  so fair in form, so attractive in manner. How can I express to you\n  my thirst for the unknown rapture of possessing an adored wife, a\n  rapture to which the union of two souls by love must give frenzied\n  intensity. Yes, my Pauline, I have sat for hours in a sort of\n  stupor caused by the violence of my passionate yearning, lost in\n  the dream of a caress as though in a bottomless abyss. At such\n  moments my whole vitality, my thoughts and powers, are merged and\n  united in what I must call desire, for lack of a word to express\n  that nameless delirium.\n\n  ""And I may confess to you now that one day, when I would not take\n  your hand when you offered it so sweetly--an act of melancholy\n  prudence that made you doubt my love--I was in one of those fits\n  of madness when a man could commit a murder to possess a woman.\n  Yes, if I had felt the exquisite pressure you offered me as\n  vividly as I heard your voice in my heart, I know not to what\n  lengths my passion might not have carried me. But I can be silent,\n  and suffer a great deal. Why speak of this anguish when my visions\n  are to become realities? It will be in my power now to make life\n  one long love-making!\n\n  ""Dearest love, there is a certain effect of light on your black\n  hair which could rivet me for hours, my eyes full of tears, as I\n  gazed at your sweet person, were it not that you turn away and\n  say, \'For shame; you make me quite shy!\'\n\n  ""To-morrow, then, our love is to be made known! Oh, Pauline! the\n  eyes of others, the curiosity of strangers, weigh on my soul. Let\n  us go to Villenoix, and stay there far from every one. I should\n  like no creature in human form to intrude into the sanctuary where\n  you are to be mine; I could even wish that, when we are dead, it\n  should cease to exist--should be destroyed. Yes, I would fain hide\n  from all nature a happiness which we alone can understand, alone\n  can feel, which is so stupendous that I throw myself into it only\n  to die--it is a gulf!\n\n  ""Do not be alarmed by the tears that have wetted this page; they\n  are tears of joy. My only blessing, we need never part again!""\n\n\n\nIn 1823 I traveled from Paris to Touraine by _diligence_. At Mer we took\nup a passenger for Blois. As the guard put him into that part of the\ncoach where I had my seat, he said jestingly:\n\n""You will not be crowded, Monsieur Lefebvre!""--I was, in fact, alone.\n\nOn hearing this name, and seeing a white-haired old man, who looked\neighty at least, I naturally thought of Lambert\'s uncle. After a few\ningenious questions, I discovered that I was not mistaken. The good man\nhad been looking after his vintage at Mer, and was returning to Blois.\nI then asked for some news of my old ""chum."" At the first word, the old\npriest\'s face, as grave and stern already as that of a soldier who has\ngone through many hardships, became more sad and dark; the lines on\nhis forehead were slightly knit, he set his lips, and said, with a\nsuspicious glance:\n\n""Then you have never seen him since you left the College?""\n\n""Indeed, I have not,"" said I. ""But we are equally to blame for our\nforgetfulness. Young men, as you know, lead such an adventurous and\nstorm-tossed life when they leave their school-forms, that it is only\nby meeting that they can be sure of an enduring affection. However,\na reminiscence of youth sometimes comes as a reminder, and it is\nimpossible to forget entirely, especially when two lads have been such\nfriends as we were. We went by the name of the Poet-and-Pythagoras.""\n\nI told him my name; when he heard it, the worthy man grew gloomier than\never.\n\n""Then you have not heard his story?"" said he. ""My poor nephew was to be\nmarried to the richest heiress in Blois; but the day before his wedding\nhe went mad.""\n\n""Lambert! Mad!"" cried I in dismay. ""But from what cause? He had the\nfinest memory, the most strongly-constituted brain, the soundest\njudgment, I ever met with. Really a great genius--with too great a\npassion for mysticism perhaps; but the kindest heart in the world.\nSomething most extraordinary must have happened?""\n\n""I see you knew him well,"" said the priest.\n\nFrom Mer, till we reached Blois, we talked only of my poor friend, with\nlong digressions, by which I learned the facts I have already related in\nthe order of their interest. I confessed to his uncle the character of\nour studies and of his nephew\'s predominant ideas; then the old man told\nme of the events that had come into Lambert\'s life since our parting.\nFrom Monsieur Lefebvre\'s account, Lambert had betrayed some symptoms of\nmadness before his marriage; but they were such as are common to men\nwho love passionately, and seemed to me less startling when I knew how\nvehement his love had been and when I saw Mademoiselle de Villenoix.\nIn the country, where ideas are scarce, a man overflowing with original\nthought and devoted to a system, as Louis was, might well be regarded\nas eccentric, to say the least. His language would, no doubt, seem the\nstranger because he so rarely spoke. He would say, ""That man does not\ndwell in heaven,"" where any one else would have said, ""We are not made\non the same pattern."" Every clever man has his own quirks of speech.\nThe broader his genius, the more conspicuous are the singularities\nwhich constitute the various degrees of eccentricity. In the country an\neccentric man is at once set down as half mad.\n\nHence Monsieur Lefebvre\'s first sentences left me doubtful of my\nschoolmate\'s insanity. I listened to the old man, but I criticised his\nstatements.\n\nThe most serious symptom had supervened a day or two before the\nmarriage. Louis had had some well-marked attacks of catalepsy. He had\nonce remained motionless for fifty-nine hours, his eyes staring, neither\nspeaking nor eating; a purely nervous affection, to which persons\nunder the influence of violent passion are liable; a rare malady,\nbut perfectly well known to the medical faculty. What was really\nextraordinary was that Louis should not have had several previous\nattacks, since his habits of rapt thought and the character of his mind\nwould predispose him to them. But his temperament, physical and mental,\nwas so admirably balanced, that it had no doubt been able to resist the\ndemands on his strength. The excitement to which he had been wound up by\nthe anticipation of acute physical enjoyment, enhanced by a chaste life\nand a highly-strung soul, had no doubt led to these attacks, of which\nthe results are as little known as the cause.\n\nThe letters that have by chance escaped destruction show very plainly a\ntransition from pure idealism to the most intense sensualism.\n\nTime was when Lambert and I had admired this phenomenon of the human\nmind, in which he saw the fortuitous separation of our two natures,\nand the signs of a total removal of the inner man, using its unknown\nfaculties under the operation of an unknown cause. This disorder, a\nmystery as deep as that of sleep, was connected with the scheme of\nevidence which Lambert had set forth in his _Treatise on the Will_. And\nwhen Monsieur Lefebvre spoke to me of Louis\' first attack, I suddenly\nremembered a conversation we had had on the subject after reading a\nmedical book.\n\n""Deep meditation and rapt ecstasy are perhaps the undeveloped germs of\ncatalepsy,"" he said in conclusion.\n\nOn the occasion when he so concisely formulated this idea, he had\nbeen trying to link mental phenomena together by a series of results,\nfollowing the processes of the intellect step by step, from their\nbeginnings as those simple, purely animal impulses of instinct, which\nare all-sufficient to many human beings, particularly to those men whose\nenergies are wholly spent in mere mechanical labor; then, going on\nto the aggregation of ideas and rising to comparison, reflection,\nmeditation, and finally ecstasy and catalepsy. Lambert, of course, in\nthe artlessness of youth, imagined that he had laid down the lines of a\ngreat work when he thus built up a scale of the various degrees of man\'s\nmental powers.\n\nI remember that, by one of those chances which seems like\npredestination, we got hold of a great Martyrology, in which the most\ncurious narratives are given of the total abeyance of physical life\nwhich a man can attain to under the paroxysms of the inner life. By\nreflecting on the effects of fanaticism, Lambert was led to believe\nthat the collected ideas to which we give the name of feelings may very\npossibly be the material outcome of some fluid which is generated in all\nmen, more or less abundantly, according to the way in which their organs\nabsorb, from the medium in which they live, the elementary atoms that\nproduce it. We went crazy over catalepsy; and with the eagerness that\nboys throw into every pursuit, we endeavored to endure pain by thinking\nof something else. We exhausted ourselves by making experiments not\nunlike those of the epileptic fanatics of the last century, a religious\nmania which will some day be of service to the science of humanity.\nI would stand on Lambert\'s chest, remaining there for several minutes\nwithout giving him the slightest pain; but notwithstanding these crazy\nattempts, we did not achieve an attack of catalepsy.\n\nThis digression seemed necessary to account for my first doubts, which\nwere, however, completely dispelled by Monsieur Lefebvre.\n\n""When this attack had passed off,"" said he, ""my nephew sank into a state\nof extreme terror, a dejection that nothing could overcome. He thought\nhimself unfit for marriage. I watched him with the care of a mother for\nher child, and found him preparing to perform on himself the operation\nto which Origen believed he owed his talents. I at once carried him\noff to Paris, and placed him under the care of Monsieur Esquirol. All\nthrough our journey Louis sat sunk in almost unbroken torpor, and did\nnot recognize me. The Paris physicians pronounced him incurable, and\nunanimously advised his being left in perfect solitude, with nothing to\nbreak the silence that was needful for his very improbable recovery,\nand that he should live always in a cool room with a subdued\nlight.--Mademoiselle de Villenoix, whom I had been careful not to\napprise of Louis\' state,"" he went on, blinking his eyes, ""but who was\nsupposed to have broken off the match, went to Paris and heard what the\ndoctors had pronounced. She immediately begged to see my nephew, who\nhardly recognized her; then, like the noble soul she is, she insisted on\ndevoting herself to giving him such care as might tend to his recovery.\nShe would have been obliged to do so if he had been her husband, she\nsaid, and could she do less for him as her lover?\n\n""She removed Louis to Villenoix, where they have been living for two\nyears.""\n\nSo, instead of continuing my journey, I stopped at Blois to go to see\nLouis. Good Monsieur Lefebvre would not hear of my lodging anywhere but\nat his house, where he showed me his nephew\'s room with the books and\nall else that had belonged to him. At every turn the old man could not\nsuppress some mournful exclamation, showing what hopes Louis\' precocious\ngenius had raised, and the terrible grief into which this irreparable\nruin had plunged him.\n\n""That young fellow knew everything, my dear sir!"" said he, laying on the\ntable a volume containing Spinoza\'s works. ""How could so well organized\na brain go astray?""\n\n""Indeed, monsieur,"" said I, ""was it not perhaps the result of its being\nso highly organized? If he really is a victim to the malady as yet\nunstudied in all its aspects, which is known simply as madness, I am\ninclined to attribute it to his passion. His studies and his mode of\nlife had strung his powers and faculties to a degree of energy beyond\nwhich the least further strain was too much for nature; Love was enough\nto crack them, or to raise them to a new form of expression which we are\nmaligning perhaps, by ticketing it without due knowledge. In fact, he\nmay perhaps have regarded the joys of marriage as an obstacle to the\nperfection of his inner man and his flight towards spiritual spheres.""\n\n""My dear sir,"" said the old man, after listening to me with attention,\n""your reasoning is, no doubt, very sound; but even if I could follow it,\nwould this melancholy logic comfort me for the loss of my nephew?""\n\nLambert\'s uncle was one of those men who live only by their affections.\n\n\n\nI went to Villenoix on the following day. The kind old man accompanied\nme to the gates of Blois. When we were out on the road to Villenoix, he\nstopped me and said:\n\n""As you may suppose, I do not go there. But do not forget what I have\nsaid; and in Mademoiselle de Villenoix\'s presence affect not to perceive\nthat Louis is mad.""\n\nHe remained standing on the spot where I left him, watching me till I\nwas out of sight.\n\nI made my way to the chateau of Villenoix, not without deep agitation.\nMy thoughts were many at each step on this road, which Louis had so\noften trodden with a heart full of hopes, a soul spurred on by the\nmyriad darts of love. The shrubs, the trees, the turns of the winding\nroad where little gullies broke the banks on each side, were to me full\nof strange interest. I tried to enter into the impressions and thoughts\nof my unhappy friend. Those evening meetings on the edge of the coombe,\nwhere his lady-love had been wont to find him, had, no doubt, initiated\nMademoiselle de Villenoix into the secrets of that vast and lofty\nspirit, as I had learned them all some years before.\n\nBut the thing that most occupied my mind, and gave to my pilgrimage the\ninterest of intense curiosity, in addition to the almost pious feelings\nthat led me onwards, was that glorious faith of Mademoiselle de\nVillenoix\'s which the good priest had told me of. Had she in the course\nof time been infected with her lover\'s madness, or had she so completely\nentered into his soul that she could understand all its thoughts, even\nthe most perplexed? I lost myself in the wonderful problem of feeling,\npassing the highest inspirations of passion and the most beautiful\ninstances of self-sacrifice. That one should die for the other is an\nalmost vulgar form of devotion. To live faithful to one love is a\nform of heroism that immortalized Mademoiselle Dupuis. When the great\nNapoleon and Lord Byron could find successors in the hearts of women\nthey had loved, we may well admire Bolingbroke\'s widow; but Mademoiselle\nDupuis could feed on the memories of many years of happiness, whereas\nMademoiselle de Villenoix, having known nothing of love but its first\nexcitement, seemed to me to typify love in its highest expression.\nIf she were herself almost crazy, it was splendid; but if she had\nunderstood and entered into his madness, she combined with the beauty\nof a noble heart a crowning effort of passion worthy to be studied and\nhonored.\n\nWhen I saw the tall turrets of the chateau, remembering how often\npoor Lambert must have thrilled at the sight of them, my heart beat\nanxiously. As I recalled the events of our boyhood, I was almost a\nsharer in his present life and situation. At last I reached a wide,\ndeserted courtyard, and I went into the hall of the house without\nmeeting a soul. There the sound of my steps brought out an old woman,\nto whom I gave a letter written to Mademoiselle de Villenoix by Monsieur\nLefebvre. In a few minutes this woman returned to bid me enter, and\nled me to a low room, floored with black-and-white marble; the Venetian\nshutters were closed, and at the end of the room I dimly saw Louis\nLambert.\n\n""Be seated, monsieur,"" said a gentle voice that went to my heart.\n\nMademoiselle de Villenoix was at my side before I was aware of her\npresence, and noiselessly brought me a chair, which at first I would not\naccept. It was so dark that at first I saw Mademoiselle de Villenoix\nand Lambert only as two black masses perceived against the gloomy\nbackground. I presently sat down under the influence of the feeling that\ncomes over us, almost in spite of ourselves, under the obscure vault of\na church. My eyes, full of the bright sunshine, accustomed themselves\ngradually to this artificial night.\n\n""Monsieur is your old school-friend,"" she said to Louis.\n\nHe made no reply. At last I could see him, and it was one of those\nspectacles that are stamped on the memory for ever. He was standing, his\nelbows resting on the cornice of the low wainscot, which threw his body\nforward, so that it seemed bowed under the weight of his bent head. His\nhair was as long as a woman\'s, falling over his shoulders and hanging\nabout his face, giving him a resemblance to the busts of the great men\nof the time of Louis XIV. His face was perfectly white. He constantly\nrubbed one leg against the other, with a mechanical action that nothing\ncould have checked, and the incessant friction of the bones made a\ndoleful sound. Near him was a bed of moss on boards.\n\n""He very rarely lies down,"" said Mademoiselle de Villenoix; ""but\nwhenever he does, he sleeps for several days.""\n\nLouis stood, as I beheld him, day and night with a fixed gaze, never\nwinking his eyelids as we do. Having asked Mademoiselle de Villenoix\nwhether a little more light would hurt our friend, on her reply I opened\nthe shutters a little way, and could see the expression of Lambert\'s\ncountenance. Alas! he was wrinkled, white-headed, his eyes dull and\nlifeless as those of the blind. His features seemed all drawn upwards to\nthe top of his head. I made several attempts to talk to him, but he did\nnot hear me. He was a wreck snatched from the grave, a conquest of life\nfrom death--or of death from life!\n\nI stayed for about an hour, sunk in unaccountable dreams, and lost in\npainful thought. I listened to Mademoiselle de Villenoix, who told me\nevery detail of this life--that of a child in arms.\n\nSuddenly Louis ceased rubbing his legs together, and said slowly:\n\n""The angels are white.""\n\nI cannot express the effect produced upon me by this utterance, by the\nsound of the voice I had loved, whose accents, so painfully expected,\nhad seemed to be lost for ever. My eyes filled with tears in spite of\nevery effort. An involuntary instinct warned me, making me doubt whether\nLouis had really lost his reason. I was indeed well assured that he\nneither saw nor heard me; but the sweetness of his tone, which seemed\nto reveal heavenly happiness, gave his speech an amazing effect. These\nwords, the incomplete revelation of an unknown world, rang in our souls\nlike some glorious distant bells in the depth of a dark night. I was no\nlonger surprised that Mademoiselle de Villenoix considered Lambert to\nbe perfectly sane. The life of the soul had perhaps subdued that of\nthe body. His faithful companion had, no doubt--as I had at that\nmoment--intuitions of that melodious and beautiful existence to which we\ngive the name of Heaven in its highest meaning.\n\nThis woman, this angel, always was with him, seated at her embroidery\nframe; and each time she drew the needle out she gazed at Lambert with\nsad and tender feeling. Unable to endure this terrible sight--for I\ncould not, like Mademoiselle de Villenoix, read all his secrets--I went\nout, and she came with me to walk for a few minutes and talk of herself\nand of Lambert.\n\n""Louis must, no doubt, appear to be mad,"" said she. ""But he is not, if\nthe term mad ought only to be used in speaking of those whose brain is\nfor some unknown cause diseased, and who can show no reason in their\nactions. Everything in my husband is perfectly balanced. Though he did\nnot actively recognize you, it is not that he did not see you. He has\nsucceeded in detaching himself from his body, and discerns us under\nsome other aspect--what that is, I know not. When he speaks, he utters\nwondrous things. Only it often happens that he concludes in speech an\nidea that had its beginning in his mind; or he may begin a sentence and\nfinish it in thought. To other men he seems insane; to me, living as I\ndo in his mind, his ideas are quite lucid. I follow the road his spirit\ntravels; and though I do not know every turning, I can reach the goal\nwith him.\n\n""Which of us has not often known what it is to think of some futile\nthing and be led on to some serious reflection through the ideas or\nmemories it brings in its train? Not unfrequently, after speaking about\nsome trifle, the simple starting-point of a rapid train of reflections,\na thinker may forget or be silent as to the abstract connection of ideas\nleading to his conclusion, and speak again only to utter the last link\nin the chain of his meditations.\n\n""Inferior minds, to whom this swift mental vision is a thing unknown,\nwho are ignorant of the spirit\'s inner workings, laugh at the dreamer;\nand if he is subject to this kind of obliviousness, regard him as a\nmadman. Louis is always in this state; he soars perpetually through the\nspaces of thought, traversing them with the swiftness of a swallow; I\ncan follow him in his flight. This is the whole history of his madness.\nSome day, perhaps, Louis will come back to the life in which we\nvegetate; but if he breathes the air of heaven before the time when we\nmay be permitted to do so, why should we desire to have him down among\nus? I am content to hear his heart beat, and all my happiness is to be\nwith him. Is he not wholly mine? In three years, twice at intervals he\nwas himself for a few days; once in Switzerland, where we went, and once\nin an island off the wilds of Brittany, where we took some sea-baths. I\nhave twice been very happy! I can live on memory.""\n\n""But do you write down the things he says?"" I asked.\n\n""Why should I?"" said she.\n\nI was silent; human knowledge was indeed as nothing in this woman\'s\neyes.\n\n""At those times, when he talked a little,"" she added, ""I think I have\nrecorded some of his phrases, but I left it off; I did not understand\nhim then.""\n\nI asked her for them by a look; she understood me. This is what I have\nbeen able to preserve from oblivion.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n\n  Everything here on earth is produced by an ethereal substance\n  which is the common element of various phenomena, known\n  inaccurately as electricity, heat, light, the galvanic fluid, the\n  magnetic fluid, and so forth. The universal distribution of this\n  substance, under various forms, constitutes what is commonly known\n  as Matter.\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n  The brain is the alembic to which the Animal conveys what each of\n  its organizations, in proportion to the strength of that vessel,\n  can absorb of that Substance, which returns it transformed into\n  Will.\n\n  The Will is a fluid inherent in every creature endowed with\n  motion. Hence the innumerable forms assumed by the Animal, the\n  results of its combinations with that Substance. The Animal\'s\n  instincts are the product of the coercion of the environment in\n  which it develops. Hence its variety.\n\n\n\n                                III\n\n  In Man the Will becomes a power peculiar to him, and exceeding in\n  intensity that of any other species.\n\n\n\n                                 IV\n\n  By constant assimilation, the Will depends on the Substance it\n  meets with again and again in all its transmutations, pervading\n  them by Thought, which is a product peculiar to the human Will, in\n  combination with the modifications of that Substance.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n  The innumerable forms assumed by Thought are the result of the\n  greater or less perfection of the human mechanism.\n\n\n\n                                  VI\n\n  The Will acts through organs commonly called the five senses,\n  which, in fact, are but one--the faculty of Sight. Feeling and\n  tasting, hearing and smelling, are Sight modified to the\n  transformations of the Substance which Man can absorb in two\n  conditions: untransformed and transformed.\n\n\n\n                                  VII\n\n  Everything of which the form comes within the cognizance of the\n  one sense of Sight may be reduced to certain simple bodies of\n  which the elements exist in the air, the light, or in the elements\n  of air and light. Sound is a condition of the air; colors are all\n  conditions of light; every smell is a combination of air and\n  light; hence the four aspects of Matter with regard to Man--sound,\n  color, smell, and shape--have the same origin, for the day is not\n  far off when the relationship of the phenomena of air and light\n  will be made clear.\n\n  Thought, which is allied to Light, is expressed in words which\n  depend on sound. To man, then, everything is derived from the\n  Substance, whose transformations vary only through Number--a\n  certain quantitative dissimilarity, the proportions resulting in\n  the individuals or objects of what are classed as Kingdoms.\n\n\n\n                                 VIII\n\n  When the Substance is absorbed in sufficient number (or quantity)\n  it makes of man an immensely powerful mechanism, in direct\n  communication with the very element of the Substance, and acting\n  on organic nature in the same way as a large stream when it\n  absorbs the smaller brooks. Volition sets this force in motion\n  independently of the Mind. By its concentration it acquires some\n  of the qualities of the Substance, such as the swiftness of light,\n  the penetrating power of electricity, and the faculty of\n  saturating a body; to which must be added that it apprehends what\n  it can do.\n\n  Still, there is in man a primordial and overruling phenomenon\n  which defies analysis. Man may be dissected completely; the\n  elements of Will and Mind may perhaps be found; but there still\n  will remain beyond apprehension the _x_ against which I once used\n  to struggle. That _x_ is the Word, the Logos, whose communication\n  burns and consumes those who are not prepared to receive it. The\n  Word is for ever generating the Substance.\n\n\n\n                                  IX\n\n  Rage, like all our vehement demonstrations, is a current of the\n  human force that acts electrically; its turmoil when liberated\n  acts on persons who are present even though they be neither its\n  cause nor its object. Are there not certain men who by a discharge\n  of Volition can sublimate the essence of the feelings of the\n  masses?\n\n\n\n                                  X\n\n  Fanaticism and all emotions are living forces. These forces in\n  some beings become rivers that gather in and sweep away\n  everything.\n\n\n\n                                  XI\n\n  Though Space _is_, certain faculties have the power of traversing\n  it with such rapidity that it is as though it existed not. From\n  your own bed to the frontiers of the universe there are but two\n  steps: Will and Faith.\n\n\n\n                                 XII\n\n  Facts are nothing; they do not subsist; all that lives of us is\n  the Idea.\n\n\n\n                                 XIII\n\n  The realm of Ideas is divided into three spheres: that of\n  Instinct, that of Abstractions, that of Specialism.\n\n\n\n                                 XIV\n\n  The greater part, the weaker part of visible humanity, dwells in\n  the Sphere of Instinct. The _Instinctives_ are born, labor, and\n  die without rising to the second degree of human intelligence,\n  namely Abstraction.\n\n\n\n                                  XV\n\n  Society begins in the sphere of Abstraction. If Abstraction, as\n  compared with Instinct, is an almost divine power, it is\n  nevertheless incredibly weak as compared with the gift of\n  Specialism, which is the formula of God. Abstraction comprises all\n  nature in a germ, more virtually than a seed contains the whole\n  system of a plant and its fruits. From Abstraction are derived\n  laws, arts, social ideas, and interests. It is the glory and the\n  scourge of the earth: its glory because it has created social\n  life; its scourge because it allows man to evade entering into\n  Specialism, which is one of the paths to the Infinite. Man\n  measures everything by Abstractions: Good and Evil, Virtue and\n  Crime. Its formula of equity is a pair of scales, its justice is\n  blind. God\'s justice sees: there is all the difference.\n\n  There must be intermediate Beings, then, dividing the sphere of\n  Instinct from the sphere of Abstractions, in whom the two elements\n  mingle in an infinite variety of proportions. Some have more of\n  one, some more of the other. And there are also some in which the\n  two powers neutralize each other by equality of effect.\n\n\n\n                                 XVI\n\n  Specialism consists in seeing the things of the material universe\n  and the things of the spiritual universe in all their\n  ramifications original and causative. The greatest human geniuses\n  are those who started from the darkness of Abstraction to attain\n  to the light of Specialism. (Specialism, _species_, sight;\n  speculation, or seeing everything, and all at once; _Speculum_, a\n  mirror or means of apprehending a thing by seeing the whole of\n  it.) Jesus had the gift of Specialism; He saw each fact in its\n  root and in its results, in the past where it had its rise, and in\n  the future where it would grow and spread; His sight pierced into\n  the understanding of others. The perfection of the inner eye gives\n  rise to the gift of Specialism. Specialism brings with it\n  Intuition. Intuition is one of the faculties of the Inner Man, of\n  which Specialism is an attribute. Intuition acts by an\n  imperceptible sensation of which he who obeys it is not conscious:\n  for instance, Napoleon instinctively moving from a spot struck\n  immediately afterwards by a cannon ball.\n\n\n\n                                 XVII\n\n  Between the sphere of Abstraction and that of Specialism, as\n  between those of Abstraction and Instinct, there are beings in\n  whom the attributes of both combine and produce a mixture; these\n  are men of genius.\n\n\n\n                                XVIII\n\n  Specialism is necessarily the most perfect expression of man, and\n  he is the link binding the visible world to the higher worlds; he\n  acts, sees, and feels by his inner powers. The man of Abstraction\n  thinks. The man of Instinct acts.\n\n\n\n                                 XIX\n\n  Hence man has three degrees. That of Instinct, below the average;\n  that of Abstraction, the general average; that of Specialism,\n  above the average. Specialism opens to man his true career; the\n  Infinite dawns on him; he sees what his destiny must be.\n\n\n\n                                  XX\n\n  There are three worlds--the Natural, the Spiritual, and the\n  Divine. Humanity passes through the Natural world, which is not\n  fixed either in its essence and unfixed in its faculties. The\n  Spiritual world is fixed in its essence and unfixed in its\n  faculties. The Divine world is necessarily a Material worship, a\n  Spiritual worship, and a Divine worship: three forms expressed in\n  action, speech, and prayer, or, in other words, in deed,\n  apprehension, and love. Instinct demands deed; Abstraction is\n  concerned with Ideas; Specialism sees the end, it aspires to God\n  with presentiment or contemplation.\n\n\n\n                                 XXI\n\n  Hence, perhaps, some day the converse of _Et Verbum caro factum\n  est_ will become the epitome of a new Gospel, which will proclaim\n  that The Flesh shall be made the Word and become the Utterance of\n  God.\n\n\n\n                                 XXII\n\n  The Resurrection is the work of the Wind of Heaven sweeping over\n  the worlds. The angel borne on the Wind does not say: ""Arise, ye\n  dead""; he says, ""Arise, ye who live!""\n\nSuch are the meditations which I have with great difficulty cast in a\nform adapted to our understanding. There are some others which Pauline\nremembered more exactly, wherefore I know not, and which I wrote from\nher dictation; but they drive the mind to despair when, knowing in what\nan intellect they originated, we strive to understand them. I will quote\na few of them to complete my study of this figure; partly, too, perhaps,\nbecause, in these last aphorisms, Lambert\'s formulas seem to include\na larger universe than the former set, which would apply only to\nzoological evolution. Still, there is a relation between the two\nfragments, evident to those persons--though they be but few--who love\nto dive into such intellectual deeps.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n\n  Everything on earth exists solely by motion and number.\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n  Motion is, so to speak, number in action.\n\n\n\n                                 III\n\n  Motion is the product of a force generated by the Word and by\n  Resistance, which is Matter. But for Resistance, Motion would have\n  had no results; its action would have been infinite. Newton\'s\n  gravitation is not a law, but an effect of the general law of\n  universal motion.\n\n\n\n                                 IV\n\n  Motion, acting in proportion to Resistance, produces a result\n  which is Life. As soon as one or the other is the stronger, Life\n  ceases.\n\n\n\n                                 V\n\n  No portion of Motion is wasted; it always produces number; still,\n  it can be neutralized by disproportionate resistance, as in\n  minerals.\n\n\n\n                                 VI\n\n  Number, which produces variety of all kinds, also gives rise to\n  Harmony, which, in the highest meaning of the word, is the\n  relation of parts to the whole.\n\n\n\n                                VII\n\n  But for Motion, everything would be one and the same. Its\n  products, identical in their essence, differ only by Number, which\n  gives rise to faculties.\n\n\n\n                                VIII\n\n  Man looks to faculties; angels look to the Essence.\n\n\n\n                                  IX\n\n  By giving his body up to elemental action, man can achieve an\n  inner union with the Light.\n\n\n\n                                  X\n\n  Number is intellectual evidence belonging to man alone; by it he\n  acquires knowledge of the Word.\n\n\n\n                                  XI\n\n  There is a Number beyond which the impure cannot pass: the Number\n  which is the limit of creation.\n\n\n\n                                  XII\n\n  The Unit was the starting-point of every product: compounds are\n  derived from it, but the end must be identical with the beginning.\n  Hence this Spiritual formula: the compound Unit, the variable\n  Unit, the fixed Unit.\n\n\n\n                                 XIII\n\n  The Universe is the Unit in variety. Motion is the means; Number\n  is the result. The end is the return of all things to the Unit,\n  which is God.\n\n\n\n                                  XIV\n\n  Three and Seven are the two chief Spiritual numbers.\n\n\n\n                                   XV\n\n  Three is the formula of created worlds. It is the Spiritual Sign\n  of the creation, as it is the Material Sign of dimension. In fact,\n  God has worked by curved lines only: the Straight Line is an\n  attribute of the Infinite; and man, who has the presentiment of\n  the Infinite, reproduces it in his works. Two is the number of\n  generation. Three is the number of Life which includes generation\n  and offspring. Add the sum of four, and you have seven, the\n  formula of Heaven. Above all is God; He is the Unit.\n\n\n\nAfter going in to see Louis once more, I took leave of his wife and\nwent home, lost in ideas so adverse to social life that, in spite of a\npromise to return to Villenoix, I did not go.\n\nThe sight of Louis had had some mysteriously sinister influence over\nme. I was afraid to place myself again in that heavy atmosphere, where\necstasy was contagious. Any man would have felt, as I did, a longing\nto throw himself into the infinite, just as one soldier after another\nkilled himself in a certain sentry box where one had committed suicide\nin the camp at Boulogne. It is a known fact that Napoleon was obliged to\nhave the hut burned which had harbored an idea that had become a mortal\ninfection.\n\nLouis\' room had perhaps the same fatal effect as that sentry box.\n\nThese two facts would then be additional evidence in favor of his theory\nof the transfusion of Will. I was conscious of strange disturbances,\ntranscending the most fantastic results of taking tea, coffee, or opium,\nof dreams or of fever--mysterious agents, whose terrible action often\nsets our brains on fire.\n\nI ought perhaps to have made a separate book of these fragments of\nthought, intelligible only to certain spirits who have been accustomed\nto lean over the edge of abysses in the hope of seeing to the bottom.\nThe life of that mighty brain, which split up on every side perhaps,\nlike a too vast empire, would have been set forth in the narrative of\nthis man\'s visions--a being incomplete for lack of force or of weakness;\nbut I preferred to give an account of my own impressions rather than to\ncompose a more or less poetical romance.\n\n\n\nLouis Lambert died at the age of twenty-eight, September 25, 1824, in\nhis true love\'s arms. He was buried by her desire in an island in the\npark at Villenoix. His tombstone is a plain stone cross, without name or\ndate. Like a flower that has blossomed on the margin of a precipice, and\ndrops into it, its colors and fragrance all unknown, it was fitting\nthat he too should fall. Like many another misprized soul, he had often\nyearned to dive haughtily into the void, and abandon there the secrets\nof his own life.\n\nMademoiselle de Villenoix would, however, have been quite justified\nin recording his name on that cross with her own.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'}","{'text': 'What is the ""poet\'s"" real name?', 'tokens': array(['What', 'is', 'the', 'poet', 's', 'real', 'name', '?'],

Threatened with arrest, Crawford and his followers hide in the Sahara erg. They intercept news that the Arab Union has occupied Tamanrasset, ostensibly to protect the region against El Hassan rioters. Crawford decides to recapture Tamanrasset and use its communications system to proclaim his regime. To do so, he sends his followers to organize troops from nearby regions: the Teda from the east, the Chaambra from the north, the Sudanese from the south, and the Nemadi, Moors, and Rifs from the West. Crawford, Isobel Cunningham, and Cliff Jackson will establish the movement's headquarters in Tuareg country. They are all to rendezvous at Tamanrasset in two weeks.\nCrawford wins the loyalty of the Tuareg warriors by offering to make them the core of El Hassan’s Desert Legion during wartime and his policemen and rangers during peacetime. Rex Donaldson, ex-field expert for the African Department of the British Commonwealth, arrives to join Crawford's organization, bringing fieldworkers Jack and Jimmy Peters and David Moroka with him. As they are being briefed, David thwarts an assassination attempt against Crawford, killing the assassin. Crawford then sends Rex to recruit troops in Senegal and Mali. Now guarded by fifteen Tuareg warriors, Crawford’s group travels the country to rally up forces for the upcoming Tamanrasset battle. They capture Dr. Warren Harding Smythe's American Medical Relief team and force them to join the group. As Crawford's team puts together El Hassan’s government, Jack proposes that they make Esperanto the common language of the movement. Kenny Ballalou arrives from the West with news: several Reunited Nations development teams have joined El Hassan, so he now controls a large portion of North Africa. As El Hassan's influence grows, so does his camp, which fills with reporters and foreign diplomats anxious to meet him.\nCrawford's group decides to use guerrilla tactics to disable the mechanized army of the Arab Union. They are reprieved from air attack temporarily when the Reunited Nations announces retaliation against any power that uses air combat. Meanwhile, David, who in reality is a Party member of the Soviet Complex, radios his superiors, revealing that he engineered the attempted assassination of Crawford to earn his trust. C.I.A. agent Fred Ostrander arrives at the camp to remind Crawford of his allegiance to the United States and the West, but Crawford responds that he is an African looking for African solutions to African problems. When Ostrander challenges Crawford to explain why he is the man to lead North Africa, Crawford responds that he was thrust into the job. He then expresses deep regret that becoming El Hassan led him to kill his best friend, Abe, who wanted him to swear allegiance to the Soviet Complex. Crawford's confession disarms David, whose spying has been fueled by a desire to revenge Abe.\nIsobel surprises David as he is reporting to his superiors, but when confronted by the team, David claims he has resigned from the Party and is now an El Hassan man. He also informs them that the Arab Union is planning to parachute troopers into various points of the Sahara. Ostrander, who has decided to join El Hassan's team as well, earns them some time by telling the commander of the Arab legion that the United States will send its own air force to aid El Hassan if the paratroopers are deployed. As everyone arms for battle, David and Ostrander have one last conversation, in which they insist that their long-term socioeconomical views have not changed, but that both believe African union takes precedence for the moment. They wish each other well during the coming fight.\nDuring the aftermath of the successful recapture of Tamanrasset, Crawford finds that Jack, David, and Ostrander are dead and that Kenny has been seriously hurt. He then receives good news and bad news: foreign countries and organizations have begun to recognize El Hassan as the legal head of North Africa; Elmer Allen has been captured by one of Crawford's enemies, the leader of the Ouled Touameur clan, Abd-el-Kader. To make matters worse, Abd-el-Kader now claims to be the reincarnation of the Mahdi, the holiest prophet since Mohammed, so that he can call on a holy war against El Hassan."", 'tokens': array(['During', 'his', 'meeting', 'in', 'Dakar', 'with', 'the', 'head',

Arrayed against him and his dream, he knew,\nwas the combined power of the world in the form of the Reunited\nNations, and, in addition, such individual powers as the United States\nof the Americas, the Soviet Complex, Common Europe, the French\nCommunity, the British Commonwealth and the Arab Union, working both\ntogether and unilaterally.\n\nImmediate survival depended upon getting into the Great Erg of the\nSahara where even the greatest powers the world had ever developed\nwould have their work cut out locating El Hassan and his people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk who was riding next to Elmer Allen in the lead air\ncushion hover-lorry, held a hand high. Both of the solar powered\ndesert vehicles ground to a halt.\n\nHomer Crawford vaulted out of the seat of the second lorry before it\nhad settled to the sand. ""What\'s up, Bey?"" he called.\n\nBey pointed to the south and west. They were in the vicinity of\nTessalit, in what was once known as French Sudan, and immediately to\nthe south of Algeria. They were deliberately avoiding what little\nexisted in this area in the way of trails, the Tanezrouft route which\ncrossed the Sahara from Colomb-BÃ©char to Gao, on the Niger, was some\nfifty miles to the west.\n\nHomer Crawford stared up into the sky in the direction Bey pointed and\nhis face went wan.\n\nThe others were piling out of the vehicles.\n\n""What is it?"" Isobel Cunningham said, squinting and trying to catch\nwhat the others had already spotted.\n\n""Aircraft,"" Bey growled. ""A rocket-plane.""\n\n""Which means the military in this part of the world,"" Homer said.\n\nThe rest of them looked to him for instructions, but Bey suddenly took\nover. He said to Homer, ""You better get on over beneath that\noutcropping of rock. The rest of us will handle this.""\n\nHomer looked at him.\n\nBey said, flatly, ""If one of the rest of us gets it, or even if all of\nus do, the El Hassan movement goes on. But if something happens to\nyou, the movement dies. We\'ve already taken our stand and too much is\nat stake to risk your life.""\n\nHomer Crawford opened his mouth to protest, then closed it. He reached\ninside the solar-powered lorry and fetched forth a Tommy-Noiseless and\nstarted for the rock outcropping at a trot. Having made his decision,\nhe wasn\'t going to cramp Bey-ag-Akhamouk\'s style with needless\npalaver.\n\nIsobel Cunningham, Cliff Jackson, Elmer Allen and Kenny Ballalou\ngathered around the tall, American educated Tuareg.\n\n""What\'s the plan?"" Elmer said. Either he or Kenny Ballalou could have\ntaken over as competently, but they were as capable of taking orders\nas giving them, a desirable trait in fighting men.\n\nBey was still staring at the oncoming speck. He growled, ""We can\'t\neven hope he hasn\'t seen the pillars of sand and dust these vehicles\nthrow up. He\'s spotted us all right. And we\'ve got to figure he\'s\nlooking for us, even though we can hope he\'s not.""\n\nThe side of his mouth began to tic, characteristically. ""He\'ll make\nthree passes. The first one high, as an initial check. The second time\nhe\'ll come in low just to make sure. The third pass and he\'ll clobber\nus.""\n\nThe aircraft was coming on, high but nearer now.\n\n""So,"" Elmer said reasonably, ""we either get him the second pass he\nmakes, or we\'ve had it."" The young Jamaican\'s lips were thinned back\nover his excellent teeth, as always when he went into combat.\n\n""That\'s it,"" Bey agreed. ""Kenny, you and Cliff get the flac rifle, and\nhave it handy in the back of the second truck. Be sure he doesn\'t see\nit on this first pass. Elmer, get on the radio and check anything he\nsends.""\n\nKenny Ballalou and the hulking Cliff Jackson ran to carry out orders.\n\nIsobel said, ""Got an extra gun for me?""\n\nBey scowled at her. ""You better get over there with Homer where it\'s\nsafer.""\n\nShe said evenly, ""I\'ve always considered myself a pacifist, but when\nsomebody starts shooting at me, I forget about it and am inclined to\nshoot back.""\n\n""I haven\'t got time to argue with you,"" Bey said. ""There aren\'t any\nextra guns except handguns and they\'d be useless."" As he spoke, he\npulled his own Tommy-Noiseless from its scabbard on the front door of\nthe air cushion lorry, and checked its clip of two hundred .10 caliber\nultra-high velocity rounds. He flicked the selector to the explosive\nside of the clip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane was roaring in on what would be its first pass, if Bey had\nguessed correctly. If he had guessed incorrectly, this might be the\nend. A charge of napalm would fry everything for a quarter of a mile\naround, or the craft might even be equipped with a mini-fission bomb.\nIn this area a minor nuclear explosion would probably go undetected.\n\nBey yelled, ""Don\'t anybody even try to fire at him at this range.\nHe\'ll be back. It takes half the sky to turn around in with that\ncrate, but he\'ll be back, lower next time.""\n\nCliff Jackson said cheerlessly, ""Maybe he\'s just looking for us. He\nwon\'t necessarily take a crack at us.""\n\nBey grunted. ""Elmer?""\n\n""Nothing on the radio,"" Elmer said. ""If he was just scouting us out,\nhe\'d report to his base. But if his orders are to clobber us, then he\nwouldn\'t put it on the air.""\n\nThe plane was turning in the sky, coming back.\n\nCliff argued, ""Well, we can\'t fire unless we know if he\'s just hunting\nus out, or trying to do us in.""\n\nElmer said patiently, ""For just finding us, that first pass would be\nall he needed. He could radio back that he\'d found us. But if he comes\nin again, he\'s looking for trouble.""\n\n""Here he comes!"" Bey yelled. ""Kenny-Cliff ... the rifle!""\n\nIsobel suddenly dashed out into the sands a dozen yards or so from the\nvehicles and began running around and around in a circle as though\ndemented.\n\nBey stared at her. ""Get back here,"" he roared. ""Under one of the\ntrucks!""\n\nShe ignored him.\n\nThe rocket-plane was coming in, low and obviously as slow as the pilot\ncould retard its speed.\n\nThe flac rifle began jumping and tracers reached out from\nit--inaccurately. The Tommy-Noiseless automatics in the hands of Bey\nand Elmer Allen gave their silenced _flic flic flic_ sounds, equally\nineffective.\n\nOn the ultra-stubby wings of the fast moving aircraft, a row of\nbrilliant cherries flickered and a row of explosive shells plowed\nacross the desert, digging twin ditches, miraculously going between\nthe air cushion lorries but missing both. It was upon them, over and\ngone, before the men on the ground could turn to fire after.\n\nElmer Allen muttered an obscenity under his breath.\n\nCliff Jackson looked around in desperation. ""What can we do now? He\nwon\'t come close enough for us to even fire at him, next time.""\n\nBey said nothing. Isobel had collapsed into the sand. Elmer Allen\nlooked over at her. ""Nice try, Isobel,"" he said. ""I think he came in\nlower and slower than he would have otherwise--trying to see what the\ndevil it was you were doing.""\n\nShe shrugged, hopelessly.\n\n""Hey!"" Kenny Ballalou pointed.\n\nThe rocketcraft was wobbling, shuddering, in the sky. Suddenly it\nburst into a black cloud of fire and smoke and explosion.\n\nAt the same moment, Homer Crawford got up from the sand dune behind\nwhich he\'d stationed himself and plowed awkwardly through the sand\ntoward them.\n\nBey glared at him.\n\nHomer shrugged and said, ""I checked the way he came in the first time\nand figured he\'d repeat the run. Then I got behind that dune there and\nfaced in the other direction and started firing where I _thought_ he\'d\nbe, a few seconds before he came over. He evidently ran right into\nit.""\n\nBey said indignantly, ""Look, wise guy, you\'re no longer the leader of\na five-man Reunited Nations African Development Project team. Then,\nyou were expendable. Now, you\'re El Hassan. You give the orders. Other\npeople are expendable.""\n\nHomer Crawford grinned at him, somewhat ruefully and held up his hands\nas though in supplication. ""Listen to the man, is that any way to talk\nto El Hassan?""\n\nElmer Allen said worriedly, ""He\'s right, though, Homer. You shouldn\'t\ntake chances.""\n\nHomer Crawford went serious. ""Actually, none of us should, if we can\navoid it. In a way, El Hassan isn\'t one person. It\'s this team here,\nand Jake Armstrong, who by this time I hope is on his way to the\nStates.""\n\nBey was shaking his head in stubborn determination. ""No,"" he said.\n""I\'m not sure that you comprehend this yourself, Homer, but you\'re\nNumber One. You\'re the symbol, the hero these people are going to\nfollow if we put this thing over. They couldn\'t understand a sextet\nleadership. They want a leader, someone to dominate and tell them what\nto do. A team you need, admittedly, but not so much as the team needs\nyou. Remember Alexander? He had a team starting off with Aristotle for\na brain-trust, and Parmenion, one of the greatest generals of all time\nfor his right-hand man. Then he had a group of field men such as\nPtolemy, Antipater, Antigonus and Seleucus--not to be rivaled until\nNapoleon built his team, two thousand years later. And what happened\nto this super-team when Alexander died?""\n\nHomer looked at him thoughtfully.\n\nBey wound it up doggedly. ""You\'re our Alexander. Our Caesar. Our\nNapoleon. So don\'t go getting yourself killed, damn it. Excuse me,\nIsobel.""\n\nIsobel grinned her pixielike grin. ""I agree,"" she said. ""Dammit.""\n\nHomer said, ""I\'m not sure I go all along with you or not. We\'ll think\nabout it."" His voice took a sharper note. ""Let\'s go over and see if\nthere\'s enough left in that wreckage to give us an idea of who the\npilot represented. I can\'t believe it was a Reunited Nations man, and\nI\'d like to know who, of our potential enemies, dislikes the idea of\nEl Hassan so much that they figure we should all be bumped off before\nwe even get under way.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had begun--if there is ever a beginning--in Dakar. In the offices\nof Sven Zetterberg the Swedish head of the Sahara Division of the\nAfrican Development Project of the Reunited Nations.\n\nHomer Crawford, head of a five-man trouble-shooting team, had reported\nfor orders. In one hand he held them, when he was ushered into the\nother\'s presence.\n\nZetterberg shook hands abruptly, said, ""Sit down, Dr. Crawford.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked at the secretary who had ushered him in.\n\nZetterberg said, scowling, ""What\'s the matter?""\n\n""I think I have something to be discussed privately.""\n\nThe secretary shrugged and turned and left.\n\nZetterberg, still scowling, resumed his own place behind the desk and\nsaid, ""Claud Hansen is a trusted Reunited Nations man. What could\npossibly be so secret...?""\n\nHomer indicated the orders he held. ""This assignment. It takes some\nconsideration.""\n\nSven Zetterberg was not a patient man. He said, in irritation, ""It\nshould be perfectly clear. This El Hassan we\'ve been hearing so much\nabout. This mystery man come out of the desert attempting to unify\nall North America. We want to talk to him.""\n\n""Why?"" Crawford said.\n\n""Confound it,"" Zetterberg snapped. ""I thought we\'d gone into this\nyesterday. In spite of the complaints that come into this office in\nregard to your cavalier tactics in carrying out your assignments, you\nand your team are our most competent operatives. So we\'ve given you\nthe assignment of finding El Hassan.""\n\n""I mean, why do you want to talk to him?""\n\nThe Swede glared at him for a moment, as though the American was being\ndeliberately dense. ""Dr. Crawford,"" he said, ""when the African\nDevelopment Project was first begun we had high hopes. Seemingly all\nReunited Nations members were being motivated by high humanitarian\nreasons. Our task was to bring all Africa to a level of progress\ncomparable to the advanced nations. It was more than a duty, it was a\ncrying need, a demand. Africa is and has been throughout history a\n_have-not_ continent. While Europe, the Americas, Australia and now\neven Asia, industrialized and largely conquered man\'s old\nsocio-economic problems, Africa lagged behind. The reasons were\nmanifold, colonialism, lingering tribal society ... various others.\nNow that very lagging has become a potential explosive situation. With\nthe coming of antibiotics and other break-throughs in medicine, the\nAfrican population is growing with an all but geometric progression.\nSo fast is it growing, that what advances were being made did less\nthan keep up the level of per capita gross product. It was bad enough\nto have a per capita gross product averaging less than a hundred\ndollars a year, but it actually sank below that point.""\n\nHomer Crawford was nodding.\n\nZetterberg continued the basic lecture with which he knew the other\nwas already completely familiar. ""So the Reunited Nations took on the\ntask of advancing as rapidly as possible the African economy and all\nthe things that must be done before an economy _can_ be advanced. It\nwas self-preservation, I suppose. _Have-not_ nations, not to speak of\n_have-not_ races and _have-not_ continents, have a tendency eventually\nto explode upon their wealthier neighbors.""\n\nThe Swede pressed his lips together before continuing. ""Unfortunately,\nthe Reunited Nations as the United Nations and the League of Nations\nbefore it, is composed of members each with its own irons in the fire.\nEach with its own plans and schemes."" His voice was bitter now. ""The\nArab Union with its desire to unite all Islam into one. The Soviet\nComplex with its ultimate dream of a soviet world. The capitalistic\neconomies of the British Commonwealth, Common Europe, and your United\nStates of the Americas, with their hunger for, positive need for,\nsources of raw materials and markets for their manufactured products.\nAll, though playing lip service to the African Development Project,\nhave still their own ambitions.""\n\nSven Zetterberg waggled a finger at Homer Crawford. ""I do not charge\nthat your United States is attempting to take over Africa, or even any\nsection of it, in the old colonialistic sense. Even England and France\nhave discovered that it is much simpler to dominate economically than\nto go through all the expense and effort of governing another people.\nThat is the basic reason they gave up their empires. No, your United\nStates would love to so dominate Africa that her products, her\nentrepreneurs, would flood the continent to the virtual exclusion of\nsuch economic competitors as Common Europe. The Commonwealth feels the\nsame, so does the French Community. The Soviets and Arabs have\ndifferent motivations, but they, too, wish to take over. The\nresult...."" The Swede tossed up his hands in a gesture more Gallic\nthan Scandinavian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n""What has all this got to do with El Hassan?"" Homer Crawford asked\nsoftly.\n\nThe Swede leaned forward. ""If we more devoted adherents of the\nReunited Nations are ever to see our hopes come true, Africa must be\nunited and made strong. And this must be done through the efforts of\n_Africans_ not Russians, British, French, Arabs ... nor even\nScandinavians. Socio-economic changes should not, possibly cannot, be\ninflicted upon a people from without. Look at the mess the Russians\nmade in such countries as Hungary, or the Americans in such as South\nKorea.""\n\n""The people themselves must have the dream,"" Crawford said softly.\n\n""I beg your pardon?""\n\n""Nothing. Go on.""\n\nZetterberg said, ""On the surface, great progress seems to be\ncontinuing. Afforestation of the Sahara, the solar pumps creating new\noases, the water purification plants on the Atlantic and\nMediterranean, pushing back the desert, the oil fields, the mines, the\nroads, the damming of the Niger. But already cracks can be seen. A\nweek or so ago, a team of Cubans, supposedly, at least, in the Sudan\nto improve sugar refining methods, were machine-gunned to death. By\nwhom? By the Sudanese? Unlikely. No, this Cuban massacre was one of\nmany recent signs of conflict between the great powers in their\nefforts to dominate. Our problem, of course, deals only with North\nAfrica, but I have heard rumors in Geneva that much the same situation\nis developing in the south as well.""\n\n""At any rate, Dr. Crawford, when the rumors of El Hassan began to come\ninto this office they brought with them a breath of hope. From all we\nhave heard, he teaches our basic program--a breaking down of old\ntribal society, education, economic progress, Pan-African unity. Dr.\nCrawford, no one with whom this office is connected seems ever to have\nseen this El Hassan but we are most anxious to talk to him. Perhaps\nthis is the man behind whom we can throw our support. Your task is to\nfind him.""\n\nHomer Crawford raked the fingers of his right hand back over his\nshort wiry hair, and grimaced. He said, ""It won\'t be necessary.""\n\n[Illustration]\n\n""I beg your pardon, Doctor?""\n\nCrawford said, ""It won\'t be necessary to go looking for El Hassan.""\n\nThe Swede scowled his irritation at the other. ""See here....""\n\nCrawford said, ""I\'m El Hassan.""\n\nSven Zetterberg stared at him, uncomprehending.\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""I suppose it\'s your turn to listen and for me\nto do the talking."" He shifted in his chair, uncomfortably. ""Dr.\nZetterberg, even before the Reunited Nations evolved the idea of the\nAfrican Development Project, it became obvious that the field work was\ngoing to have to be in the hands of Negroes. The reason is doublefold.\nFirst, the African doesn\'t trust the white man, for good reason.\nSecond, the white man is a citizen of his own country, first of all,\nand finds it difficult not to have motives connected with his own race\nand nation. But the African Negro, too, has his tribal and sometimes\nnational affiliations and cannot be trusted not to be prejudiced in\ntheir favor. The answer? The educated American Negro, such as myself.""\n\n""I haven\'t the slightest idea from whence came my ancestors, from what\npart of Africa, what tribe, what nation. But I am a Negro and ...\nwell, have the dream of bettering my race. I have no irons in the\nfire, beyond altruistic ones. Of course, when I say American Negroes I\ndon\'t exclude Canadian ones, or those of Latin America or the\nCaribbean. It is simply that there are greater numbers of educated\nAmerican Negroes than you find elsewhere.""\n\nZetterberg said impatiently, ""Please, Dr. Crawford. Come to the point.\nThat ridiculous statement you made about El Hassan.""\n\n""Of course, I am merely giving background. Most of we field workers,\nnot only the African Development teams, but such organizations as the\nAfrica for Africans Association and the representatives of the African\nDepartment of the British Commonwealth, and of the French Community\'s\nAfrican Affairs sector, are composed of Negroes.""\n\nZetterberg was nodding. ""All right, I know.""\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""The teams of all these organizations do their\nbest to spur African progress, in our case, in North Africa,\nespecially the area between the Niger and the Mediterranean. Often we\ndisguise ourselves as natives since in that manner we are more quickly\ntrusted. We wear the clothes, speak the local language or lingua\nfranca.""\n\nThe American hesitated a moment, then plunged in. ""Dr. Zetterberg, the\nAfrican is still a primitive but newly beginning to move out of a\ntradition-ritual-taboo tribal society. He seeks a hero to follow, a\nman of towering prestige who knows the answers to all questions. We\nmay not _like_ this fact, we with our traditions of democracy, but it\nis so. The African is simply not yet at that stage of society where\npolitical democracy is applicable.""\n\n""My team does most of its work posing as Enaden--low caste itinerant\nsmiths of the Sahara. As such we can go any place and are everywhere\naccepted, a necessary sector of the Saharan economy. As such, we\ncontinually spread the ... ah, propaganda of the Reunited Nations--the\nneed for education, the need for taking jobs on the new projects, the\nneed for casting aside old institutions and embracing the new. Early\nin the game we found our words had little weight coming from simple\nEnaden smiths so we ... well, _invented_ this mysterious El Hassan,\nand everything we said we attributed to him.""\n\n""News spreads fast in the desert, astonishingly fast. El Hassan\nstarted with us but soon other teams, hearing about him and realizing\nthat his message was the same as that they were trying to propagate,\ndid the same thing. That is, attributed the messages they had to\nspread to El Hassan. It was amusing when a group of us got together\nlast week in Timbuktu, to find that we\'d all taken to kowtowing to\nthis mythical desert hero who planned to unite all North Africa.""\n\nThe Swede was staring at him unbelievingly. ""But, a bit earlier you\nsaid you were El Hassan.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked into his chief\'s face and nodded seriously.\n""I\'ve been conferring with various other field workers, both Reunited\nNations and otherwise. The situation calls for a real El Hassan. If we\ndon\'t provide him, someone else will. I propose to take over the\nposition.""\n\nSven Zetterberg\'s face was suddenly cold. ""And why, Dr. Crawford, do\nyou think you are more qualified than others?""\n\nThe American Negro could hardly fail to note the other\'s disapproval.\nHe said evenly, but definitely, ""Through experience. Through\neducation. Through ... through having the dream, Dr. Zetterberg.""\n\n""The Reunited Nations cannot support such a project, Dr. Crawford. I\nabsolutely forbid you to consider it.""\n\n""Forbid me?""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was as though a strange something entered the atmosphere of the\nroom, almost as though a new _presence_ was there. And almost, it\nseemed to Sven Zetterberg, that the already tall, solidly built man\nacross from him grew physically as his voice seemed to swell, to reach\nout, to dominate. There was a new, and all but unbelievable Homer\nCrawford here.\n\nThe Swedish official regathered his forces. This was ridiculous. He\nsaid again, ""I forbid you to...."" the sentence dribbled away under the\ncold disdain in the air now.\n\nHomer Crawford said flatly, ""You don\'t seem to understand, Zetterberg.\nThe Reunited Nations has no control over El Hassan. Homer Crawford, as\nof this meeting, has resigned his post with the African Development\nProject. And El Hassan has begun his task of uniting all North\nAfrica.""\n\nSven Zetterberg, shaken by this new and unsuspected force the other\nseemed to be able to bring to his command, fought back. ""It will be\nsimple to discredit you, to let it be known that you are no more than\nan ambitious American out to seize power illegally.""\n\nCrawford\'s scorn held an element of amusement. ""Try it. I suspect your\nattempts to discredit El Hassan will prove unsuccessful. He has\nalready been rumored to be everything from an Ethiopian to the Second\nComing of the Messiah. Your attempt to brand him an American\nadventurer will be swallowed up in the flood of other rumor.""\n\nThe Swede was still shaken by the strange manner in which his once\nsubordinate had suddenly dominated him. Sven Zetterberg was not a man\nto be dominated, to be made unsure.\n\nTime folded back on itself and for a moment he was again a lad and on\nvacation with his father in Bavaria. They were having lunch in the\nfamed HofbraÃ¼haus, largest of the Munich beercellars, and even a\nten-year-old could sense an anticipation in the air, particularly\namong the large number of brownshirted men who had gathered to one\nside of the ground level of the beer hall. His father was telling Sven\nof the history of the medieval building when a silence fell. Into the\nbeer hall had come a pasty faced, trenchcoat garbed little man, his\nface set in stern lines but insufficiently to offset the ludicrous\nmustache. He was accompanied by an elderly soldier in the uniform of a\nField Marshal, by a large tub of a man whose face beamed--but\nevilly--and by a pinch faced cripple. All were men of command, all\nexcept the pasty faced one, to whom they seemingly and surprisingly,\ndeferred. And then he stood on a heavy chair and spoke. And then his\n_power_ reached out and grasped all within reach of his shrill voice.\nGrasped them and compelled them and they became a shouting, red faced,\narm brandishing mob, demanding to be led to glory. And Sven\'s father\nhad bustled the shocked boy from the building.\n\nIt came back to him now, clearly and forcefully, and he realized that\nwhatever it was with which the Beast of Berchtesgaden had enchanted\nhis people, that power was on call in Homer Crawford. Whether he used\nit for good or evil, that enchanting power was on call. And again Sven\nZetterberg was shaken.\n\nHomer Crawford was on his feet, preparatory to leaving.\n\nThe Swede simply _had_ to reassert himself. ""Dr. Crawford, the\nReunited Nations is not without resources. You\'ll be arrested before\nyou leave Dakar.""\n\nAn element of the tenseness left the air when Crawford smiled and\nsaid, ""Doctor, for several years now I have been playing hide and seek\nin the Sahara, doing your work. You mentioned earlier that my team is\nthe most experienced and capable. Just whom are you going to send to\npick me up? Members of some of the other teams? Old friends and\ncomrades in arms. Many of whom owe their lives to my team when all\nbets were down. Please do send them, Doctor, I am going to need\nrecruits.""\n\nHe swung and left the office and even as he went could hear the angry\nReunited Nations chief blasting into an interoffice communicator. He\ndecided he\'d better see if there wasn\'t a back door or window through\nwhich to leave the building. He\'d have to phone Bey, Isobel and the\nothers and get together for a meeting to plan developments. El Hassan\nwas getting off to a fast start, already he was on the lam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer Crawford played it safe. From the nearest public phone he called\nIsobel Cunningham at the Hotel Juan-le-Pin. No matter how fast Sven\nZetterberg swung into action, it would take his operatives some time\nto connect Isobel with Homer and his team. As an employee of the\nAfrica for Africans Association, she would ordinarily come in little\ncontact with the Reunited Nations teams.\n\nHe said, ""Isobel? Homer here. Can you talk?""\n\nShe said, ""Cliff and Jake are here.""\n\nHe said, ""Have you sounded them out? How do they feel about the El\nHassan project?""\n\n""They\'re in. At least, Jake is. We\'re still arguing with Cliff.""\n\n""O.K. Now listen, carefully. Zetterberg turned thumbs down on the\nwhole deal, for various reasons we can discuss later. In fact, he\'s\nincensed and threatened to take steps to keep us from leaving Dakar.""\n\nIsobel was alerted but she snorted deprecation. ""What do you want?""\n\n""They\'re probably already looking for me, and in a matter of minutes\nwill probably try to pick up Bey-ag-Akhamouk, Elmer Allen and Kenny\nBallalou, the other members of my team. Get in touch with them\nimmediately and tell them to get into native costume and into hiding.\nYou and Jake--and Cliff--do the same.""\n\n""Right. Where do we meet and when?""\n\n""In the _souk_, in the food market. There\'s a native restaurant there,\nrun by a former Vietnamese. We\'ll meet there at approximately noon.""\n\n""Right. Anything else?""\n\nHomer said, ""Tell Bey to bring along an extra 9mm Recoilless for me.""\n\n""Yes, El Hassan,"" she said, her voice expressionless. She didn\'t waste\ntime. Homer Crawford heard the phone click as she hung up.\n\nHe was in a branch building of the post and telegraph network on the\nRue des Resistance. Before leaving it, he looked out a window. Half a\nblock away was the office of the Sahara Division of the African\nDevelopment Project. Even as he watched, a dozen men hurried out the\nfront door, fanned out in all directions.\n\nHomer grinned sourly. Old Sven was moving fast.\n\nHe shot a quick glance around the lobby of the building. He had to get\ngoing. Zetterberg had started with a dozen men to trail down El\nHassan. He\'d probably have a hundred involved before the hour was out.\n\nA corridor turned off to the right. Homer hurried down it. At each\ndoor he looked inside. To whoever occupied the room he murmured a few\nwords of apology in Wolof, the Sengalese lingua franca. The fourth\noffice was empty.\n\nHomer stood there before it for a long, agonizing moment, waiting for\nthe right person to pass. Finally, the man he needed came along.\nAbout six feet tall, about a hundred and eighty; dressed in the local\nnative dress and on the ragged side.\n\nHomer said to him authoritatively, in the Wolof tongue, ""You there,\ncome in here!"" He opened the door, and pointed into the office.\n\nThe other, taken aback, demurred.\n\nHomer\'s face and tone went still more commanding. ""Step in here,\nbefore I call the police.""\n\nIt was all a mistake, of course. The Senegalese made the gesture\nequivalent to the European\'s shrug, and entered the office.\n\nHomer came in behind him, closed the door. He wasted no time in\npreliminaries. Before the native turned, the American\'s hand lashed\nout in a karate blow which stunned the other. Homer Crawford caught\nhim, even as he fell, and lowered him gently to the floor.\n\n""Sorry, old boy,"" he muttered, ""but this is probably the most\nprofitable thing that\'s happened to you this year.""\n\nHe stripped off the other\'s clothes, as rapidly as he could make his\nhands fly. The other was still out and probably would be for another\nten minutes, Crawford estimated. He stripped off his own clothes and\ndonned the native\'s.\n\nLast of all, he took his wallet from his pocket, divided the money it\ncontained and stuffed a considerable wad of it into the European\nclothing he was abandoning.\n\n""Don\'t spend all of that in one place,"" he growled softly.\n\nHomer dragged the other to a side of the room so that the body could\nnot be spotted from the entrance. Then he crossed to the door, opened\nit and stepped into the corridor beyond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no need for sulking. He walked out the front door and headed\naway from the dock and administration buildings area and toward the\nnative section, passing the Reunited Nations building on the way.\n\nDakar teems with multitudes of a dozen tribes come in from the jungles\nand the bush, the desert and the swamp areas of the sources of the\nNiger, to look for work on the new projects, to visit relatives, to\nmarket for the products of civilization--or to gawk. Homer Crawford\ndisappeared into them. One among many.\n\nToward noon, he entered the cleared area which was the restaurant he\nhad named to Isobel and squatted before the pots to the far end of the\nVietnamese owned eatery, examining them with care. He chose a large\nchunk of barbequed goat and was served it with a half pound piece of\nunsalted Senegalese bread, torn from a monstrous loaf, and a twisted\npiece of newspaper into which had been measured an ounce or so of\ncoarse salt. He took his meal and went to as secluded a corner as he\ncould find.\n\nHomer Crawford chuckled inwardly. That morning he had breakfasted in\nthe most swank hotel in West Africa. He wished there was some manner\nin which he could have invited Sven Zetterberg to dine here with him.\nOr, come to think of it, a group of the students he had once taught\nsociology at the University of Michigan. Or, possibly, prexy\nWallington, under whom he had worked while taking his doctor\'s degree.\n\nYes, it would have been interesting to have had a luncheon companion.\n\nA native woman, on the stoutish side but with her hair done up in one\nof the fabulously ornate hair styles specialized in by the Senegalese,\nand wearing a flowing, shapeless dress of the garish textiles run off\npurposely for this market in Japan and Manchester, waddled up to take\na place nearby. She bore a huge skewer of barbequed beef chunks, and a\nhunk of bread not unlike Homer\'s own.\n\nShe grumbled uncomfortably, her back to the American, as she settled\ninto a position on the floor. And she mumbled as she began chewing at\nthe meat.\n\n_No table manners_, Homer Crawford grinned inwardly. He wondered how\nlong it would take for the others to get here. He wasn\'t worried about\nIsobel, Cliff Jackson and Jake Armstrong. It would take time before\nZetterberg\'s Reunited Nations cloak and dagger boys got around to\nthem, but he wasn\'t sure that she\'d be able to locate his own team in\ntime. That bit he\'d given the Swede official about his being so\nbully-bully with the other Reunited Nations teams was in the way of\nbeing an exaggeration, with the idea of throwing the other off.\nActually, working in the field on definite assignments, it was seldom\nyou ran into other African Development Project men. But perhaps it\nwould tie Zetterberg up, wondering just who he could trust to send\nlooking for El Hassan.\n\nHe finished off his barbequed goat and the bread and wiped his hands\non his clothes. Nobody here yet. To have an excuse for staying, he\nwould have to buy a bottle of Gazelle beer, the cheap Senegalese brew\nwhich came in quart bottles and was warm and on the gassy side.\n\nIt was then that the woman in front of him, without turning, said\nsoftly, ""El Hassan?""\n\n\nII\n\nHomer Crawford stared at her, unbelievingly. The woman couldn\'t\npossibly be an emissary from Isobel or from one of his own companions.\nThis situation demanded the utmost secrecy, they hadn\'t had time to\nscreen any outsiders as to trustworthiness.\n\nShe turned. It was Isobel. She chuckled softly, ""You should see your\nface.""\n\nHis eyes went to her figure.\n\n""Done with mirrors,"" Isobel said. ""Or, at least, with pillows.""\n\nHomer didn\'t waste time. ""Where are the others? They should be here by\nnow.""\n\n""We figured that the fewer of us seen on the streets, the better. So\nthey\'re waiting for you. Since I was the most easily disguised, the\nleast suspicious looking, I was elected to come get you.""\n\n""Waiting where?""\n\nShe licked the side of her mouth, a disconcerting characteristic of\nhers, and looked at him archly. ""Those pals of yours have quite a bit\non the ball on their own. They decided that there was a fairly good\nchance that Sven Zetterberg wasn\'t exactly going to fall into your\narms, so they took preliminary measures. Kenny Ballalou rented a small\nhouse, here in the native quarter. We\'ve all rendezvoused there. See,\nyou aren\'t the only one on the ball.""\n\nHomer frowned at her, for the moment being in no mood for humor. ""What\nwas the idea of sitting here for the past five minutes without even\nspeaking? You must have recognized me, knowing what to look for.""\n\nShe nodded. ""I ... I wasn\'t sure, Homer, but I had the darnedest\nfeeling I was being followed.""\n\nHis glance was sharp now. First at her, then a quick darting around\nthe vicinity. ""Woman\'s intuition,"" he snapped, ""or something\nsubstantial?""\n\nShe frowned at him. ""I\'m not a ninny, Homer.""\n\nHis voice softened and he said quickly, ""Don\'t misunderstand, Isobel.\nI know that.""\n\nShe forgot about her objection to his tone. ""Even intuition doesn\'t\ncome out of a clear sky. Something sparks it. Subconscious psi,\npossibly, but a spark.""\n\n""However?"" he prodded.\n\n""I took all precautions. I can\'t seem to put my finger on anything.""\n\n""O.K.,"" he said decisively. ""Let\'s go then."" He came to his feet and\nreached a hand down for her.\n\n""Heavens to Betsy,"" she said, ""don\'t do that.""\n\n""What?""\n\n""Help a woman in public. You\'ll look suspicious."" She came to her own\nfeet, without aid.\n\n_Damn_, he thought. She was right. The last thing he wanted was to\ndraw attention to a man who acted peculiarly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey made their way out of the food market and into the _souk_ proper,\nHomer walking three or four paces ahead of her, Isobel demurely\nbehind, her eyes on the ground. They passed the native stands and tiny\nshops, and the even smaller venders and hucksters with their products\nof the mass production industries of East and West, side by side with\nthe native handicrafts ranging from carved wooden statues, jewelry,\n_gris gris_ charms and kambu fetishes, to ceramics whose designs went\nback to an age before the Portuguese first cruised off this coast. And\neverywhere was color; there are no people on earth more color\nconscious than the Senegalese.\n\nIsobel guided him, her voice quiet and still maintaining its\nuncharacteristic demure quality.\n\nHe would never have recognized Isobel, Homer Crawford told himself.\nIsobel Cunningham, late of Columbia University where she\'d taken her\nMaster\'s in anthropology. Isobel Cunningham, whom he had told on their\nfirst meeting that she looked like the former singing star, Lena\nHorne. Isobel Cunningham, slight of build, pixie of face, crisply\nmodern American with her tongue and wit. Was he in love with her? He\ndidn\'t know. El Hassan had no time, at present, for those things love\nimplied.\n\nShe said, ""Here,"" and led the way down a brick paved passage to a\nsmall house, almost a hut, that lay beyond.\n\nHomer Crawford looked about him critically before entering. He said,\n""I suppose this has been scouted out adequately. Where\'s the back\nentrance?"" He scowled. ""Haven\'t the boys posted a sentry?""\n\nA voice next to his ear said pleasantly, ""Stick \'em up, stranger.\nWhere\'d you get that zoot suit?""\n\nHe jerked his head about. There was a very small opening in the wooden\nwall next to him. It was Kenny Ballalou\'s voice.\n\n""Zoot suit, yet!"" Homer snorted. ""I haven\'t heard that term since I\nwas in rompers.""\n\n""You in rompers I\'d like to see,"" Kenny snorted in his turn. ""Come on\nin, everybody\'s here.""\n\nThe aged, unpainted, warped, wooden house consisted of two rooms, the\none three times as large as the second. The furniture was minimal, but\nthere was sitting room on chair, stool and bed for the seven of them.\n\n""Hail, O El Hassan!"" Elmer Allen called sourly, as Homer entered.\n\n""And the hail with you,"" Homer called back, then, ""Oops, sorry,\nIsobel.""\n\nIsobel put her hands on her hips, greatly widened by the stuffing\nshe\'d placed beneath her skirts. ""Look,"" she said. ""Thus far, the El\nHassan organization, which claims rule of all North Africa, consists\nof six men and one dame ... ah, that is, one lady. Just so the lady\nwon\'t continually feel that she\'s being a drag on the conversation,\nyou are hereby allowed in moments of stress such shocking profanity as\nan occasional damn or hell. But only if said lady is also allowed such\nexpletives during periods of similar stress.""\n\nEveryone laughed, and found chairs.\n\n""I\'m in love with Isobel Cunningham,"" Bey announced definitely.\n\n""Second the motion,"" Elmer said.\n\nThe rest of them called, ""Aye.""\n\n""O.K.,"" Homer Crawford said glumly, ""I can see that this is going to\nbe one tight knit organization. Six men in love with the one dame ...\nah, that is, lady. Kind of a reverse harem deal. Oh, this is going to\nlead to great co-operation.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey laughed again and then Jake said, ""Well, what\'s the story, Homer?\nHow does the El Hassan project sound to Zetterberg and the Reunited\nNations?""\n\nCliff Jackson laughed bitterly. ""Why do you think we\'re in hiding?""\nOnly he and Jake Armstrong wore western clothing. Kenny Ballalou,\nBey-ag-Akhamouk and Elmer Allen were in native dress, similar to that\nof Homer Crawford. Elmer Allen even bore a pilgrim\'s staff.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrawford, glad that the edge of tenseness had been taken off the group\nby the banter with Isobel, turned serious now.\n\nHe said, ""This is where we each take our stand. You can turn back at\nthis point, any one of you, and things will undoubtedly go on as\nbefore. You\'ll keep your jobs, have no marks against you. Beyond this\npoint, and there\'s no turning back. I want you all to think it over,\nbefore coming to any snap decisions.""\n\nElmer Allen said, his face wearing its usual all but sullen\nexpression. ""How about you?""\n\nHomer said evenly, ""I\'ve already taken my stand.""\n\nKenny Ballalou yawned and said, ""I\'ve been in this team for three or\nfour years, I\'m too lazy to switch now Besides, I\'ve always wanted to\nbe a corrupt politician. Can I be treasurer in this El Hassan regime?""\n\n""No,"" Homer said. ""Bey?""\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk said, ""I\'ve always wanted to be a general. I\'ll come\nin under those circumstances.""\n\nHomer said, his voice still even. ""That\'s out. From this point in,\nyou\'re a Field Marshal and Minister of Defense.""\n\n""Shucks,"" Bey said. ""I\'d always wanted to be a general.""\n\nHomer Crawford said dryly, ""Doesn\'t anybody take this seriously? It\'s\nprobably going to mean all your necks before it\'s through, you know.""\n\nElmer Allen said dourly, ""I take it seriously. I spent the idealistic\nyears, the school years, working for peace, democracy, a better world.\nNow, here I am, helping to attempt to establish a tyranny over half\nthe continent of my racial background. But I\'m in.""\n\n""Right,"" Homer said, the side of his mouth twitching. ""You can be our\nMinister of Propaganda.""\n\n""Minister of Propaganda!"" Elmer wailed. ""You mean like Goebbels? Me!""\n\nHomer laughed. ""O.K., we\'ll call it Minister of Information, or Press\nSecretary to El Hassan. It all means the same thing."" He looked at\nJacob Armstrong and said, ""How old are you, Jake?""\n\n""That\'s none of your business,"" the white-haired Jake said\naggressively. ""I\'m in. El Hassan is the only answer. North Africa has\ngot to be united, both for internal and external purposes. If you ...\nif we ... don\'t do the job first, somebody else will, and off hand, I\ncan\'t think of anybody else I trust. I\'m in.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him for a long moment. ""Yes,"" he said\nfinally. ""Of course you are. Jake, you\'ve just been made our combined\nForeign Minister and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to the Reunited\nNations. You\'ll leave immediately, first for Geneva, to present our\ndemands to the Reunited Nations, then to New York.""\n\n""What do I do in New York?"" Jake Armstrong said blankly, trying to\nassimilate the curves that were being thrown to him.\n\n""You raise money and support from starry eyed Negro groups and\nindividuals. You line up such organizations as the Africa for Africans\nAssociation behind El Hassan. You give speeches, and ruin your liver\neating at banquets every night in the week. You send out releases to\nthe press. You get all the publicity for the El Hassan movement you\ncan. You send official protests to the governments of every country in\nthe world, every time they do something that doesn\'t fit in with our\nneeds. You locate recruits and send them here to Africa to take over\nsome of the load. I don\'t have to tell you what to do. You can think\non your feet as well as I can. Do what is necessary. You\'re our\nForeign Minister. Don\'t let us see your face again until El Hassan is\nin control of North Africa.""\n\nJake Armstrong blinked. ""How will I prove I\'m your representative?\nI\'ll need more than just a note _To Whom It May Concern_.""\n\nHomer Crawford thought about that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey said, ""One of our first jobs is going to have to be to capture a\ntown where they have a broadcast station, say Zinder or In Salah. When\nwe do, we\'ll announce that you\'re Foreign Minister.""\n\nCrawford nodded. ""That\'s obviously the ticket. By that time you should\nbe in New York, with an office opened.""\n\nJake rubbed a black hand over his cheek as though checking his morning\nshave. ""It\'s going to take some money to get started. Once started I\ncan depend on contributions, perhaps, but at first....""\n\nHomer interrupted with, ""Cliff, you\'re Minister of the Treasury.\nRaise some money.""\n\n""Eh?"" Cliff Jackson said blankly. The king-size, easy-going\nCalifornian looked more like the early Joe Louis than ever.\n\nEverybody laughed. Elmer Allen came forth with his wallet and began\npulling out such notes as it contained. ""I don\'t know what we\'d be\ndoing with this in the desert,"" he said.\n\nIsobel said, ""I have almost three thousand dollars in a checking\naccount in New York. Let\'s see if I have my checkbook here.""\n\nThe others were going through their pockets. As bank notes in British\npounds, American dollars, French francs and Common Europe marks\nemerged they were tossed to the center of the small table which\nwobbled on three legs in the middle of the room.\n\nElmer Allen said, ""I have an account with the Bank of Jamaica in\nKingston. About four hundred pounds, I think. I\'ll have it\ntransferred.""\n\nCliff took up the money and began counting it, making notations on a\nnotebook pad as he went.\n\nBey said, ""We\'re only going to be able to give Jake part of this.""\n\n""How\'s that?"" Elmer growled. ""What use have we for money in the\nSahara? Jake\'s got to put up a decent front in Geneva and New York.""\n\nBey said doggedly, ""As Defense Minister, I\'m opposed to El Hassan\'s\nfollowers _ever_ taking anything without generous payment. We\'ll need\nfood and various services. From the beginning, we\'re going to have to\npay our way. We can\'t afford to let rumors start going around that\nwe\'re nothing but a bunch of brigands.""\n\n""Bey\'s right,"" Homer nodded. ""The El Hassan movement is going to have\nto maintain itself on the highest ethical level. We\'re going to take\nover where the French Camel Corps left off and police North Africa.\nThere can\'t be a man from Somaliland to Mauretania who can say that\none of El Hassan\'s followers liberated him from as much as a date.""\n\nKenny Ballalou said, ""You can always requisition whatever you need and\ngive them a receipt, and then we\'ll pay off when we come to power.""\n\n""That\'s out!"" Bey snapped. ""Most of these people can\'t read. And even\nthose that do don\'t trust what they read. A piece of paper, in their\neyes, is no return for some goats, or flour, camels, horses, or\nwhatever else it might be we need. No, we\'re going to have to pay our\nway.""\n\nCrawford raked a hand back through his wiry hair. ""Bey\'s right, Kenny.\nIt\'s going to be a rough go, especially at first.""\n\nKenny snorted. ""What do you mean, _at first?_ What\'s going to happen,\n_at second_ to make it any easier? Where\'re we going to get all this\nmoney we\'ll need to pay for even what we ourselves use, not to speak\nof the thousands of men we\'re going to have to have if El Hassan is\never to come to power?""\n\nBey\'s eyebrows went up in shocked innocence. ""Kenny, dear boy, don\'t\nmisunderstand. We don\'t requisition anything from individuals, or\nclans, or small settlements. But if we take over a town such as Gao,\nor Niamey, or Colomb-BÃ©char, or wherever, there is nothing to say that\na legal government such as that of El Hassan, can\'t requisition the\ncontents of the local banks.""\n\nHomer Crawford said with dignity, ""The term, my dear Minister of\nDefense, currently is to _nationalize_ the bank. Whether or not we\nwish to have the banks remain nationalized, after we take over, we can\nfigure out later. But in the early stages, I\'m afraid we\'re going to\nhave to nationalize just about every bank we come in contact with.""\n\nCliff Jackson said cautiously, ""I haven\'t said whether or not I\'ll\ncome in yet, but just as a point, I might mention issuing your own\nlegal tender. As soon as you liberate a printing press somewhere, of\ncourse.""\n\nEveryone was charmed at the idea.\n\nIsobel said, ""You can see Cliff was _meant_ to be Minister of\nTreasury. He\'s got _wholesale_ larceny in his soul, none of this\npicayunish stuff such as robbing nomads of their sheep.""\n\nElmer Allen was shaking his head sadly. ""This whole conversation\nstarted with Bey protesting that we couldn\'t allow ourselves to be\nthought of as brigands. Now listen to you all.""\n\nKenny Ballalou said with considerable dignity, ""See here, friend.\nDon\'t you know the difference between brigandage and international\nfinance?""\n\n""No,"" Elmer said flatly.\n\n""Hm-m-m,"" Kenny said.\n\n""Let\'s get on with this,"" Homer said. ""The forming of El Hassan\'s\nbasic government is beginning to take on aspects of a minstrel show.\nThen we\'ve all declared ourselves in ... except Cliff.""\n\nAll eyes turned to the bulky Californian.\n\nHe sat scowling.\n\nHomer said, easily, ""You\'re not being urged, Cliff. You can turn back\nat this point.""\n\nElmer Allen growled, ""You came to Africa to help your race develop its\ncontinent. To conquer such problems as sufficient food, clothing and\nshelter for all. To bring education and decent medical care to a\npeople who have had possibly the lowest living standards anywhere. Can\nyou see any way of achieving this beyond the El Hassan movement?""\n\nCliff looked at him, still scowling stubbornly. ""That\'s not why I came\nto Africa.""\n\nTheir eyes were all on him, but they remained silent.\n\nHe said, defensively, ""I\'m no do-gooder. I took a job with the Africa\nfor Africans Association because it was the best job I could find.""\n\nIsobel broke the silence by saying softly, ""I doubt it, Cliff.""\n\nThe big man stood up from where he\'d been seated on the bed. ""O.K.,\nO.K. Possibly there were other angles. I wanted to travel. Wanted to\nsee Africa. Besides, it was good background for some future job. I\nfigured it wouldn\'t hurt me any, in later years, applying for some\nfuture job. Maybe with some Negro concern in the States. I\'d be able\nto say I\'d put in a few years in Africa. Something like a Jew in New\nYork who was a veteran of the Israel-Arab wars, before the debacle.""\n\nThey still looked at him, none of them accusingly.\n\nHe was irritated as he paced. ""Don\'t you see? Everybody doesn\'t have\nthis _dream_ that Homer\'s always talking about. That doesn\'t mean I\'m\nabnormal. I just don\'t have the interest you do. All I want is a good\njob, some money in the bank, security back in the States. I\'m not\ninterested in dashing all over the globe, getting shot at, dying for\nsome ideal.""\n\nHomer said gently, ""It\'s up to you, Cliff. Nobody\'s twisting your\narm.""\n\nThere was sweat on the big man\'s forehead. ""All I came to Africa for\nwas the job, the money I got out of it,"" he repeated, insisting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Homer Crawford suddenly came the realization that the other needed\nan out, an excuse. An explanation to himself for doing something he\nwanted to do but wouldn\'t admit because it went against the\nopportunistic code he told himself he followed.\n\nHomer said, ""All right. How much are you making as a field worker for\nthe Africa for Africans Association?""\n\nCliff looked at him, uncomprehending. ""Eight thousand dollars, plus\nexpenses.""\n\n""O.K., we\'ll double that. Sixteen thousand to begin with, as El\nHassan\'s Minister of Treasury and whatever other duties we can think\nof to hang on you.""\n\nThere was a long moment of silence, unbroken by any of the others.\nFinally in a gesture of desperation, Cliff Jackson waved at the money\nand checks sitting on the center table. ""Sixteen thousand a year! The\nwhole organization doesn\'t have enough to pay me six months\' salary.""\n\nHomer said mildly, ""That\'s why your pay was doubled. You have to take\nrisks to make money in this world, Cliff. If El Hassan does come to\npower, undoubtedly you\'ll get other raises--along with greater\nresponsibility.""\n\nHe looked into Cliff Jackson\'s face, and although his words had dealt\nwith money, a man\'s dream looked out from his eyes. And the force of\npersonality that could emanate from Homer Crawford, possibly\nunbeknownst to himself, flooded over the huge Californian. The others\nin the room could feel it. Elmer Allen cleared his throat; Isobel held\nher elbows to her sides, in a feminine protest against naked male\npsychic strength.\n\nKenny Ballalou said without inflection, ""Put up or shut up, Cliff old\npal.""\n\nCliff Jackson sank back onto the spot on the bed he\'d occupied before.\n""I\'m in,"" he muttered, so softly as hardly to be heard.\n\n""None of you are in,"" a voice from the doorway said.\n\nThe figure that stood there held a thin, but heavy calibered\nautomatic in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a dapper man, neat, trim, smart. His clothes were those of\nGreater Washington, rather than Dakar and West Africa. His facial\nexpression seemed overly alert, overly bright, and his features were\nmore Caucasian than Negroid.\n\nHe said, ""I believe you all know me. Fredric Ostrander.""\n\n""Of the Central Intelligence Agency,"" Homer Crawford said dryly. He as\nwell as Bey, Elmer and Kenny had risen to their feet when the newcomer\nentered from the smaller of the hut\'s two rooms. ""What\'s the gun for,\nOstrander?""\n\n""You\'re under arrest,"" the C.I.A. man said evenly.\n\nElmer Allen snorted. ""Under whose authority are you working? As a\nJamaican, I\'m a citizen of the West Indies and a subject of Her\nMajesty.""\n\n""We\'ll figure that out later,"" Ostrander rapped. ""I\'m sure the\nappropriate Commonwealth authorities will co-operate with the State\nDepartment and the Reunited Nations in this matter."" The gun\nunwaveringly went from one of them to the other, retraced itself.\n\nBey looked at Homer Crawford.\n\nCrawford shook his head gently.\n\nHe said to the newcomer, ""The question still stands, Ostrander. Under\nwhose authority are you operating? I don\'t think you have jurisdiction\nover us. We\'re in Africa, not in the United States of the Americas.""\n\nOstrander said tightly, ""Right now I\'m operating under the authority\nof this weapon in my hand. Dr. Crawford. Do you realize that all of\nyou Americans here are risking your citizenship?""\n\nKenny Ballalou said, ""Oh? Tell us more, Mr. State Department man.""\n\n""You\'re serving in the armed forces of a foreign power.""\n\nEven the dour Elmer Allen laughed at that one.\n\nCrawford said, ""The fact of the matter is, we _are_ the foreign\npower.""\n\n""You\'re not amusing, Dr. Crawford,"" Ostrander said. ""I\'ve kept up with\nthis situation since you had that conference in Timbuktu. The State\nDepartment has no intention of allowing some opportunist, backed by\nknown communists and fellow travelers, to seize power in this portion\nof the world. In a matter of months the Soviets would be in here.""\n\nIsobel said evenly, ""I was formerly a member of the Party. I no longer\nam. I am an active opponent of the Soviet Complex at the moment,\nespecially in regard to its activity in Africa.""\n\nOstrander snorted his disbelief.\n\nElmer Allen said, ""You chaps never forget, do you?"" He looked at the\nothers and explained. ""Back during college days, I signed a few peace\npetitions, that sort of thing. Ever since, every time I come in\ncontact with these people, you\'d think I was Lenin or Trotsky.""\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""My opinion is, Ostrander, that you\'ve had to\nmove too quickly to check back with your superiors. Has the State\nDepartment actually instructed you to arrest me and my companions here\non foreign soil, without a warrant?""\n\nOstrander clipped, ""That\'s my responsibility. I\'m taking you all in.\nWe\'ll solve such problems as jurisdiction and warrants when I get you\nto the Reunited Nations headquarters.""\n\n""Ah?"" Homer Crawford said. ""And then what happens to us?""\n\nOstrander jiggled the gun, impatiently. ""Sven Zetterberg is of the\nopinion that you should immediately be flown out of Africa and the\ncase brought before the High Council of the African Development\nProject. What measures will be taken beyond that point I have no way\nof knowing.""\n\nBey took a step to the left, Kenny Ballalou one to the right. Homer\nCrawford remained immediately before the C.I.A. operative, his hands\nslightly out from his sides, palms slightly forward.\n\nOstrander snapped, ""I\'m prepared to fire, you men. I don\'t\nunderestimate the importance of this situation. If your crazy scheme\nmakes any progress at all, it might well result in the death of\nthousands. I know your background, Crawford. You once taught judo in\nthe Marines. I\'m not unfamiliar with the art myself.""\n\nIsobel had a hand to her mouth, her eyes were wide. ""Boys, don\'t ...""\nshe began.\n\nElmer Allen had been leaning on his pilgrim\'s staff, as though weary\nwith this whole matter. He said to Ostrander, interestedly, ""So you\'ve\nbeen checked out on judo? Know anything about the use of the\nquarterstaff?""\n\nOstrander kept his gun traversing between the four of them. ""Eh?"" he\nsaid.\n\nElmer Allen shifted his grip on his staff infinitesimally. Of a\nsudden, the end of the staff, now gripped with both hands near the\ncenter, moved at invisibly high speed. There was a crack of the wrist\nbone, and the gun went flying. The other end of the staff flicked out\nand rapped the C.I.A. operative smartly on the head.\n\nFredric Ostrander crumbled to the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n""Confound it, Elmer,"" Crawford said. ""What\'d you have to go and do\nthat for? I wanted to talk to him some more and send a message back to\nZetterberg. Sooner or later we\'ve got to make our peace with the\nReunited Nations.""\n\nElmer said embarrassedly, ""Sorry, it just happened. I was merely going\nto knock the gun out of his hand, but then I couldn\'t help myself. I\nwas tired of hearing that holier-than-thou voice of his.""\n\nKenny Ballalou looked down at the fallen man gloomily. ""He\'ll be out\nfor an hour. You\'re lucky you didn\'t crack his skull.""\n\n""Holy Mackerel,"" Cliff Jackson said. ""I\'m going to have to learn to\noperate one of those things.""\n\nElmer Allen handed him the supposed pilgrim\'s staff. ""Best\nhand-to-hand combat weapon ever invented,"" he said. ""The British\nyeoman\'s quarterstaff. Of course, this is a modernized version. Made\nof epoxy resin glass-fiber material, treated to look like wood. That\nstuff can turn a high-velocity bullet, let alone a sword, and it can\nbe bent in a ninety degree arc without the slightest effect, although\nit\'d take a power-driven testing machine to do it.""\n\n""All right, all right,"" Homer said. ""We haven\'t got time for lessons\nin the use of the quarterstaff. Let\'s put some thought to this\nsituation. If Ostrander here was able to find us, somebody else would,\ntoo.""\n\nIsobel licked the side of her mouth. ""He was probably following me.\nRemember, I told you Homer?""\n\nKenny said, ""If he had anyone with him, he\'d have brought them along\nto cover him. You\'ve got to give him credit for bravery, taking on the\nwhole bunch of us by himself.""\n\n""Um-m-m,"" Homer said. ""I wish he was with us instead of against us.""\n\nJake Armstrong said, ""Well, this solves one problem.""\n\nThey looked at him.\n\nHe said, ""Just as sure as sure, he\'s got a car parked somewhere. A car\nwith some sort of United States or Reunited Nations emblem on it.""\n\n""So what?"" Kenny said.\n\n""So you\'ve got to get out of town before the search for you _really_\ngets under way. With such a car, you can get past any roadblock that\nmight already be up between here and the Yoff airport.""\n\nElmer Allen had sunk to his knees and was searching the fallen C.I.A.\nman. He came up with car keys and a wallet.\n\nHomer said to Jake Armstrong, ""Why the Yoff airport?""\n\n""Our plane is there,"" Jake told him. ""The one assigned Isobel, Cliff\nand me by the AFAA. You\'re going to have to make time. Get somewhere\nout in the ah, boondocks, where you can begin operations.""\n\nBey said thoughtfully, ""He\'s right, Homer. Anybody against us, like\nour friend here""--he nodded at Ostrander--""is going to try to get us\nquick, before we can get the El Hassan movement under way. We\'ve got\nto get out of Dakar and into some area where they\'ll have their work\ncut out trying to locate us.""\n\nHomer Crawford accepted their council. ""O.K., let\'s get going. Jake,\nyou\'ll stay in Dakar, and at first play innocent. As soon as possible,\ntake plane for Geneva. As soon as you\'re there, send out press\nreleases to all the news associations and the larger papers. Announce\nyourself as Foreign Minister of El Hassan and demand that he be\nrecognized as the legal head of state of all North Africa.""\n\n""Wow,"" Cliff Jackson said.\n\n""Then play it by ear,"" Homer finished.\n\nHe turned to the others. ""Bey, where\'d you leave our two hover-lorries\nwhen you came here to Dakar?""\n\n""Stashed away in the ruins of a former mansion in Timbuktu. Hired two\nSonghai to watch them.""\n\n""O.K. Cliff, you\'re the only one in European dress. Take this wallet\nof Ostrander\'s. You\'ll drive the car. If we run into any roadblocks\nbetween here and the Yoff airport, slow down a little and hold the\nwallet out to show your supposed identification. They won\'t take the\ntime to check the photo. Bluff your way past, don\'t completely stop\nthe car.""\n\n""What happens if they do stop us?"" Cliff said worriedly.\n\nKenny Ballalou said, ""That\'ll be just too bad for them.""\n\nBey stooped and scooped up the fallen automatic of Fredric Ostrander\nand tucked it into the voluminous folds of his native robe. ""Here we\ngo again,"" he said.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe man whose undercover name was Anton, landed at Gibraltar in a BEA\nroco-jet, passed quickly through customs and immigration with his\nCommonwealth passport and made his way into town. He checked with a\nBobby and found that he had a two-hour wait until the Mons Capa ferry\nleft for Tangier, and spent the time wandering up and down Main\nStreet, staring into the Indian shops with their tax-free cameras from\nCommon Europe, textiles from England, optical equipment from Japan,\nand cheap souvenirs from everywhere. Gibraltar, the tourist\'s shopping\nparadise.\n\nThe trip between Gibraltar and Tangier takes approximately two hours.\nIf you\'ve never made it before, you stand on deck and watch Spain\nrecede behind you, and Africa loom closer. This was where Hercules\nsupposedly threw up his Pillars, Gibraltar being the one on the\nEuropean shore. Those who have made the trip again and again, sit down\nin the bar and enjoy the tax-free prices. The man named Anton stood on\nthe deck. He was African by birth, but he\'d never been to Morocco\nbefore.\n\nWhen he landed, he made the initial error of expecting the local\ncitizenry to speak Arabic. They didn\'t. Rif, a Berber tongue, was the\nfirst language. The man called Anton had to speak French to make known\nhis needs. He took a Chico cab up from the port to the El Minza hotel,\nimmediately off the Plaza de France, the main square of the European\nsection.\n\nAt the hotel entrance were two jet-black doormen attired in a\npseudo-Moroccan costume of red fez, voluminous pants and yellow\nbarusha slippers. They made no note of his complexion, there is no\ncolor bar in the Islamic world.\n\nHe had reservations at the desk. He left his passport there to go\nthrough the standard routine, including being checked by the police,\nhad his bag sent up to his room and, a few minutes later, hands\nnonchalantly in pockets, strolled along the Rue de LibertÃ© toward the\ncasbah area of the medina. Up from the native section of town streamed\nhordes of costumed Rifs, Arabs, Berbers of a dozen tribes, even an\noccasional Blue Man. At least half the women still wore the haik and\nveil, half the men the burnoose. Africa changes slowly, the man\ncalled Anton admitted to himself all over again--so slowly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDown from the European section, which could have been a Californian\ncity, filtered every nation of the West, from every section of Common\nEurope, the Americas, the Soviet Complex. If any city in the world is\na melting pot, it is Tangier, where Africa meets Europe and where East\nmeets West.\n\nHe passed through the teaming Grand Zocco market, and through the\ngates of the old city. He took Rue Singhalese, the only street in the\nmedina wide enough to accommodate a vehicle and went almost as far as\nthe Zocco Chico, once considered the most notorious square in the\nworld.\n\nFor a moment the man called Anton stood before one of the Indian shops\nand stared at the window\'s contents. Carved ivory statuettes from the\nFar East, cameras from Japan, ebony figurines, chess sets of water\njade, gimcracks from everywhere.\n\nA Hindu stood in the doorway and rubbed his hands in a gesture so\nstereotyped as to be ludicrous. ""Sir, would you like to enter my shop?\nI have amazing bargains.""\n\nThe man they called Anton entered.\n\nHe looked about the shop, otherwise empty of customers. Vaguely, he\nwondered if the other ever sold anything, and, if so, to whom.\n\nHe said, ""I was looking for an ivory elephant, from the East.""\n\nThe Indian\'s eyebrows rose. ""A white elephant?""\n\n""A red elephant,"" the man called Anton said.\n\n""In here,"" the Hindu said evenly, and led the way to the rear.\n\nThe rooms beyond were comfortable but not ostentatious. They passed\nthrough a livingroom-study to an office beyond. The door was open and\nthe Indian merely gestured in the way of introduction, and then left.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky, agent superior of the _Chrezvychainaya Komissiya_\nfor North Africa, looked up from his desk, smiled his pleasure, came\nto his feet and held out his hand.\n\n""Anton!"" he said. ""I\'ve been expecting you.""\n\nThe man they called Anton smiled honestly and shook. ""Kirill,"" he\nsaid. ""It\'s been a long time.""\n\nThe other motioned to a comfortable armchair, resumed his own seat.\n""It\'s been a long time all right--almost five years. As I recall, I\nwas slung over your shoulder, and you were wading through those\nconfounded swamps. The ...""\n\n""The Everglades.""\n\n""Yes."" The heavy-set Russian espionage chief chuckled. ""You are much\nstronger than you look, Anton. As I recall, I ordered you to abandon\nme.""\n\nThe wiry Negro grunted deprecation. ""You were delirious from your\nwound.""\n\nThe Russian came to his feet, turned his back and went to a small\nimprovised bar. He said, his voice low, ""No, Anton, I wasn\'t\ndelirious. Perhaps a bit afraid, but then the baying of dogs is\ndisconcerting.""\n\nThe man they called Anton said, ""It is all over now.""\n\nThe Russian returned and said, ""A drink, Anton? As I recall you were\nnever the man to refuse a drink. Scotch, bourbon, vodka?""\n\nThe other shrugged. ""I believe in drinking the local product. What is\nthe beverage of Tangier?""\n\nKirill Menzhinsky took up a full bottle the contents of which had a\ngreenish, somewhat _oily_ tinge. ""Absinthe,"" he said. ""Guaranteed to\nturn your brains to mush if you take it long enough. What was the name\nof that French painter...?""\n\n""Toulouse Lautrec,"" Anton supplied. ""I thought the stuff was illegal\nthese days."" He watched the other add water to the potent liqueur.\n\nThe Russian chuckled. ""Nothing is illegal in Tangier, my dear Anton,\nexcept the Party."" He laughed at his own joke and handed the other his\nglass. He poured himself a jolt of vodka and returned to his chair.\n""To the world revolution, Anton.""\n\nThe Negro saluted with his drink. ""The revolution!""\n\nThey drank.\n\nThe Russian put down his glass and sighed. ""I wish we were some place\nin our own lands, Anton. Dinner, many drinks, perhaps some girls, eh?""\n\nAnton shrugged. ""Another time, Kirill.""\n\n""Yes. As it is, we should not be seen together. Nor, for that matter\nshould you even return here. The imperialists are not stupid. Very\npossibly, American and Common Europe espionage agents know of this\nheadquarters. Not to speak of the Arab Union. I shall try to give you\nthe whole story and your assignment in this next half hour. Then you\nshould depart immediately.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man they called Anton sipped his drink and relaxed in his chair.\nHe looked at his superior without comment.\n\nThe Russian took another jolt of his water-clear drink. ""Have you ever\nheard of El Hassan?""\n\nThe Negro thought a moment before saying, ""Vaguely. Evidently an Arab,\nor possibly a Tuareg. North African nationalist. No, that wouldn\'t be\nthe word, since he is international. At any rate, he seems to be\ndrawing a following in the Sahara and as far south as the Sudan. Backs\nmodernization and wants unity of all North Africa. Is he connected\nwith the Party?""\n\nThe espionage chief was shaking his head. ""That is the answer I\nexpected you to give, and is approximately what anyone else would have\nsaid. Actually, there is no such person as El Hassan.""\n\nAnton frowned. ""I\'m afraid you\'re wrong there, Kirill. I\'ve heard\nabout him in half a dozen places. Very mysterious figure. Nobody seems\nto have seen him, but word of his program is passed around from\nEthiopia to Mauretania.""\n\nThe Russian was shaking his head negatively. ""That I know. It\'s a\nrather strange story and one rather hard to believe if it wasn\'t for\nthe fact that one of my operatives was in on the, ah, _manufacturing_\nof this Saharan leader.""\n\n""Manufacturing?""\n\n""I\'ll give you the details later. Were you acquainted with Abraham\nBaker, the American comrade?""\n\n""Were? I _am_ acquainted with him. Abe is a friend as well as a\ncomrade.""\n\nThe Russian shook his head again. ""Baker is dead, Anton. As you\npossibly know, his assignment for the past few years has been with a\nReunited Nations African Development Project team, working in the\nSahara region. We planted him there expecting the time to arrive when\nhis services would be of considerable value. He worked with a five-man\nteam headed by a Dr. Homer Crawford and largely the team\'s task was to\neliminate bottlenecks that developed as the various modernization\nprojects spread over the desert.""\n\n""But what\'s this got to do with _manufacturing_ El Hassan?""\n\n""I\'m coming to that. Crawford\'s team, including Comrade Baker, usually\ndisguised themselves as Enaden smiths. As such, their opinions carried\nlittle weight so in order to spread Reunited Nations propaganda, they\nhit upon the idea of imputing everything they said to this great hero\nof the desert, El Hassan.""\n\n""I see,"" the man called Anton said.\n\n""Others, without knowing the origin of our El Hassan, took up the idea\nand spread it. These nomads are at an ethnic level where they want a\nhero to follow, a leader. So in order to give prestige to their\nteachings the various organizations trying to advance North Africa\nfollowed in Crawford\'s footsteps and attributed their teachings to\nthis mysterious El Hassan.""\n\n""And it snowballed.""\n\n""Correct! But the point is that after a time Crawford came around to\nthe belief that there should be a real El Hassan. That the primary\ntask at this point is to unite the area, to break down the old tribal\nsociety and introduce the populace to the new world.""\n\n""He\'s probably right,"" the man called Anton growled. He finished his\ndrink, got up from his chair and on his own went over and mixed\nanother. ""More vodka?"" he asked.\n\n""Please."" The Russian held up his glass and went on talking. ""Yes,\nundoubtedly that is what is needed at this point. As it is, things are\ntrending toward a collapse. The imperialists, especially the\nAmericans, of course, wish to dominate the area for their capitalistic\npurposes. The Arab Union wishes to take over _in toto_ and make it\npart of their Islamic world. We, of course, cannot afford to let\neither succeed.""\n\nThe Negro resumed his chair, sipped at his drink and listened, nodding\nfrom time to time.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky said, ""As you know, Marx and Engels when founding\nscientific socialism had no expectation that their followers would\nfirst come to power in such backward countries as the Russia of 1917\nor the China of 1949. In fact, the establishment of true socialism\npresupposes a highly developed industrial economy. It is simply\nimpossible without such an economy. When Lenin came to power in 1917,\nas a result of the chaotic conditions that prevailed upon the military\ncollapse of Imperial Russia, he had no expectation of going it alone,\nas the British would say. He expected immediate revolutions in such\ncountries as Germany and France and supposed that these more advanced\ncountries would then come to the assistance of the Soviet Union and\nall would advance together to true socialism.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n""It didn\'t work out that way,"" the man called Anton said dryly.\n\n""No, it didn\'t. And Lenin didn\'t live to see the steps that Stalin\nwould take in order to build the necessary industrial base in Russia.""\nKirill Menzhinsky looked about the room, almost as though checking to\nsee if anyone else was listening. ""Some of our more unorthodox\ntheoreticians are inclined to think that had Lenin survived the\nassassin\'s bullet, that Comrade Stalin would have found it necessary\nto, ah, liquidate him.""\n\nThe Russian cleared his throat. ""Be that as it may, basic changes were\nmade in Marxist teachings to fit into Stalin\'s and later Khrushchev\'s\nnew concepts of the worker\'s State. And the Soviet Union muddled\nthrough, as the British have it. Today, the Soviet Complex is as\npowerful as the imperialist powers.""\n\nThe espionage leader knocked back his vodka with a practiced stiff\nwristed motion. ""Which brings us to the present and to North Africa.""\nHe leaned forward in emphasis. ""Comrade, if the past half century and\nmore has taught us anything, it is that you cannot establish socialism\nin a really backward country. In short, communism is impossible in\nNorth Africa at this point in her social evolution. Impossible. You\ncannot go directly from tribal society to communism. At this historic\npoint, there is no place for the party\'s program in North Africa.""\n\nThe man called Anton scowled.\n\nThe Russian waggled his hand negatively. ""Yes, yes. I know.\nUltimately, the whole world must become Soviet. Only that way will we\nachieve our eventual goal. But that is the long view. Realistically,\nwe must face it, as the Yankees say. This area is not at present soil\nfor our seed.""\n\n""Things move fast these days,"" the Negro growled. ""Industrialization,\neducation, can be a geometric progression.""\n\nHis superior nodded emphatically. ""Of course, and as little as ten or\nfifteen years from now, given progress at the present rate, perhaps\nthere will be opportunity for our movement. But now? No.""\n\nThe other said, ""What has all this to do with El Hassan, or Crawford,\nor whatever the man\'s name is?""\n\n""Yes,"" the Russian said. ""Homer Crawford has evidently decided to\nbecome El Hassan.""\n\n""Ahhh.""\n\n""Yes. At this point, in short, he is traveling in our direction. He is\ndoing what we realize must be done.""\n\n""Then we will support him?""\n\n""Now we come to the point, Anton. Homer Crawford is not sympathetic to\nthe Party. To the contrary. Our suspicion, although we have no proof,\nis that he killed Comrade Abe Baker, when Baker approached him on his\nstand in regard to the Party\'s long view.""\n\n""I see,"" the man called Anton said.\n\nThe Russian nodded. ""We must keep in some sort of touch with him--some\nsort of control. If this El Hassan realizes his scheme and unites all\nNorth Africa, sooner or later we will have to deal with him. If he is\nantagonistic, we will have to find means to liquidate him.""\n\n""And my assignment...?""\n\n""He will be gathering followers at this point. Many followers, most of\nwhom will be unknown to him. You will become one of them. Raise\nyourself to as high a rank as you find possible in his group. Become a\nclose friend, if that can be done....""\n\n""He killed Abe Baker, eh?""\n\nThe Russian frowned. ""This is an assignment, Comrade Anton. There is\nno room for personal feelings. You are a good field man. Among the\nbest. You are being given this task because the Party feels you are\nthe man for it. Possibly it is an assignment that will take years in\nthe fulfilling.""\n\nThe Negro said nothing.\n\n""Are there any questions?""\n\n""Do we have any other operatives working on this?""\n\nThe frown became a scowl. ""An Isobel Cunningham worked with Comrade\nBaker, but it has been suspected that she has been drifting away from\nthe party these past few years. Her present status is unknown, but she\nis believed to be with Homer Crawford and his followers. Possibly she\nhas defected. If so, you will take whatever measures seem necessary.\nYou will be working almost completely on your own, Comrade. You must\nthink on your feet, as the Yankees say.""\n\nThe man called Anton thought a moment. He said, ""You\'d better give me\nas thorough a run down as possible on this Homer Crawford and his\nimmediate followers.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMenzhinsky settled back in his chair and took up a sheaf of papers\nfrom the desk. ""We have fairly complete dossiers. I\'ll give you the\nhighlights, then you can take these with you to your hotel to study at\nleisure.""\n\nHe took up the first sheet. ""Homer Crawford. Born in Detroit of\nworking-class parents. In his late teens interrupted his education to\ncome to Africa where he joined elements of the F.L.N. in Morocco and\ntook part in several forays into Algeria. Evidently was wounded and\ninvalided back to the States where he resumed his education. When he\ncame of military age, he joined the Marine Corps and spent the usual,\nah, hitch I believe they call it. Following that, he resumed his\neducation, finally taking a doctor\'s degree in sociology. He then\ntaught for a time until the Reunited Nations began its African\nprogram. He accepted a position, and soon distinguished himself.""\n\nThe Russian took up another paper. ""According to Comrade Baker\'s\nreports, Crawford is an outstanding personality, dominating others,\neven in spite of himself. He would make a top party man. Idealistic,\nstrong, clever, ruthless when ruthlessness is called for.""\n\nMenzhinsky paused for a moment, finding words hard to come by from an\nultra-materialist. His tone went wry. ""Comrade Baker also reported a\nsomewhat mystical quality in our friend Crawford. An ability in times\nof emotional crisis to break down men\'s mental barriers against him. A\n_force_ that ...""\n\nThe other raised his eyebrows.\n\nHis superior chuckled, ruefully. ""Comrade Baker was evidently much\nswayed by the man\'s personality. However, Anton, I might point out\nthat similar reports have come down to us of such a dominating\npersonality in Lenin, and, to a lesser degree, in Stalin."" He twisted\nhis mouth. ""History leads us to believe that such personalities as\nJesus and Mohammed seemed to have some power beyond that of we more\nmundane types.""\n\n""And the others?"" Anton said.\n\nThe Russian took up still another paper. ""Elmer Allen. Born of small\nfarmer background on the outskirts of Kingston, on the island of\nJamaica. Managed to work his way through the University of Kingston\nwhere he took a master\'s degree in sociology. At one time he was\nthought to be Party material and was active in several organizations\nthat held social connotations, pacifist groups and so forth. However,\nhe was never induced to join the Party. Upon graduation, he\nimmediately took employment with the Reunited Nations and was assigned\nto Homer Crawford\'s team. He is evidently in accord with Crawford\'s\naims as El Hassan.""\n\nThe espionage chief took up another sheet. ""Bey-ag-Akhamouk ...""\n\nThe other scowled. ""That can\'t be an American name.""\n\n""No. He is the only real African associated with Crawford at this\npoint. He was evidently born a Taureg and taken to the States at an\nearly age, three or four, by a missionary. At any rate, he was\neducated at the University of Minnesota where he studied political\nscience. We have no record of where he stands politically, but Comrade\nBaker rated him as an outstanding intuitive soldier. A veritable\ngenius in combat. He would seem to have had military experience\nsomewhere, but we have no record of it. Our Bey-ag-Akhamouk seems\nsomewhat of a mystery man.""\n\nThe Russian sorted out another sheet. ""Kenneth Ballalou, born in\nLouisiana, educated in Chicago. Another young man but evidently as\ncapable as the others. He seems to be quite a linguist. So far as we\nknow, he holds no political stand whatsoever.""\n\nMenzhinsky pursed his lips before saying, ""The Isobel Cunningham I\nmentioned worked with the Africa for Africans Association with two\ncolleagues, a Jacob Armstrong and Clifford Jackson. It is possible\nthat these two, as well as Isobel Cunningham, have joined El Hassan.\nIf so, we will have to check further upon them, although I understand\nArmstrong is rather elderly and hardly effective under the\ncircumstances.""\n\nThe man called Anton said evenly, ""And this former comrade, Isobel\nCunningham, has evidently joined with Crawford even though he ... was\nthe cause of Abe Baker\'s death?""\n\n""Evidently.""\n\nThe Negro\'s eyes narrowed.\n\nThe other said, ""And evidently she is a most intelligent and\nattractive young lady. We had rather high hopes for her formerly.""\n\nThe Negro party member came to his feet and gathered up the sheaf of\npapers from the desk. ""All right,"" he said. ""Is there anything else?""\n\nThe espionage chief shook his head. ""You do not need a step by step\nblueprint, Anton, that is why you have been chosen for this\nassignment. You are strongly based in Party doctrine. You know what is\nneeded, we can trust you to carry on the Party\'s aims."" After a pause,\nthe Russian added, ""Without being diverted by personal feelings.""\n\nAnton looked him in the face. ""Of course,"" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFredric Ostrander was on the carpet.\n\nHis chief said, ""You seem to have conducted yourself rather\nprecipitately, Fred.""\n\nOstrander shrugged in irritation. ""I didn\'t have time to consult\nanyone. By pure luck, I spotted the Cunningham girl and since I knew\nshe had affiliated herself with Crawford, I followed her.""\n\nThe chief said dryly, ""And tried to arrest the seven of them, all by\nyourself.""\n\n""I couldn\'t see anything else to do.""\n\nThe C.I.A. official said, ""In the first place, we have no legal\njurisdiction here and you could have caused an international stink.\nThe Russkies would just love to bring something like this onto the\nReunited Nations floor. In the second place, you failed. How in the\nworld did you expect to take on that number of men, especially\nCrawford and his team?""\n\nOstrander flushed his irritation. ""Next time ..."" he began.\n\nHis chief waved a hand negatively. ""Let\'s hope there isn\'t going to be\nnext time, of this type."" He took up a paper from his desk. ""Here\'s\nyour new job, Fred. You\'re to locate this El Hassan and keep in\ncontinual contact with him. If he meets with any sort of success at\nall, and frankly our agency doubts that he will, you will attempt to\nbring home to Crawford and his followers the fact that they are\nAmericans, and orientate them in the direction of the West. Above all,\nyou are to keep in touch with us and keep us informed on all\ndevelopments. Especially notify us if there is any sign that our El\nHassan is in communication with the Russkies or any other foreign\nelement.""\n\n""Right,"" Ostrander said.\n\nHis chief looked at him. ""We\'re giving you this job, Fred, because\nyou\'re more up on it than anyone else. You\'re in at the beginning, so\nto speak. Now, do you want me to assign you a couple of assistants?""\n\n""White men?"" Ostrander said.\n\nHis higher-up scowled. ""You know you\'re the only Negro in our agency,\nFred.""\n\nFredric Ostrander, his voice still even, said, ""That\'s too bad,\nbecause anyone you assigned me who wasn\'t a Negro would be a hindrance\nrather than an assistant.""\n\nThe other drummed his fingers on the table in irritation. He said\nsuddenly, ""Fred, do you think I ought to do a report to Greater\nWashington suggesting they take more Negro operatives into the\nagency?""\n\nOstrander said dryly, ""You\'d better if this department is going to get\nmuch work done in Africa."" He stood up. ""I suppose that the sooner I\nget onto the job, the better. Do you have any idea at all where\nCrawford and his gang headed after they left me unconscious in that\nfilthy hut?""\n\n""No, we haven\'t the slightest idea of where they might be, other than\nthat they left your car abandoned at the Yoff airport.""\n\n""Oh, great,"" Fredric Ostrander complained. ""They\'ve gone into hiding\nin an area somewhat twice the size of the original fifty United\nStates.""\n\n""Good luck,"" his chief said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRex Donaldson, formerly of Nassau in the British Bahamas, formerly of\nthe College of Anthropology, Oxford, now field man for the African\nDepartment of the British Commonwealth working at expediting native\ndevelopment, was taking time out for needed and unwonted relaxation.\nIn fact, he stretched out on his back in the most comfortable bed, in\nthe most comfortable hotel, in the Niger town of Mopti. His hands\nwere behind his head, and his scowling eyes were on the ceiling.\n\nHe was a small, bent man, inordinately black even for the Sudan and\nthe loincloth costume he wore was ludicrous in the Westernized comfort\nof the hotel room. He was attired for the bush and knew that it was\nsheer laziness now that kept him from taking off for the Dogon country\nof the Canton de Sangha where he was currently working to bring down\ntribal prejudices against the coming of the schools. He had his work\ncut out for him in the Dogon, the old men, the tribal elders they\ncalled Hogons, instinctively knew that the coming of education meant\nsubversion of their institutions and the eventual loss of Hogon power.\n\nHis portable communicator, sitting on the bedside table, buzzed and\nthe little man grumbled a profanity and swung his crooked legs around\nto the floor. His eyebrows went up when he realized it was a priority\ncall which probably meant from London.\n\nHe flicked the reception switch and a girl\'s face faded onto the\nscreen. She said, ""A moment, Mr. Donaldson, Sir Winton wants you.""\n\n""Right,"" Rex Donaldson said. Sir Winton, yet. Head of the African\nDepartment. Other than photographs, Donaldson had never seen his\nultimate superior, not to mention speaking to him personally.\n\nThe girl\'s face faded out and that of Sir Winton Brett-Homes faded in.\nThe heavy-set, heavy-faced Englishman looked down, obviously checking\nsomething on his desk. He looked up again, said, ""Rex Donaldson?""\n\n""Yes, sir.""\n\n""I won\'t waste time on preliminaries, Donaldson. We\'ve been\ndiscussing, here, some of the disconcerting rumors coming out of your\nsection. Are you acquainted with this figure, El Hassan?""\n\nThe black man\'s eyes widened. He said, cautiously, ""I have heard a\ngood many stories and rumors.""\n\n""Yes, of course. They have been filtering into this office for more\nthan a year. But thus far little that could be considered concrete has\ndeveloped.""\n\nRex Donaldson held his peace, waited for the other to go on.\n\nSir Winton said impatiently, ""Actually, we are still dealing with\nrumors, but they are beginning to shape up. Evidently, this El Hassan\nhas finally begun to move.""\n\n""Ahhh,"" the wiry little field man breathed.\n\nThe florid faced Englishman said, ""As we understand it, he wishes to\ncut across tribal, national and geographic divisions in all North\nAfrica, wishes to unite the whole area from Sudan to the\nMediterranean.""\n\n""Yes,"" Donaldson nodded. ""That seems to be his program.""\n\nSir Winton said, ""It has been decided that the interests of Her\nMajesty\'s government and that of the Commonwealth hardly coincide with\nsuch an attempt at this time. It would lead to chaos.""\n\n""Ahhh,"" Donaldson said.\n\nSir Winton wound it up, all but beaming. ""Your instructions, then,\nare to seek out this El Hassan and combat his efforts with whatever\nmeans you find necessary. We consider you one of our most competent\noperatives, Donaldson.""\n\nRex Donaldson said slowly, ""You mean that he is to be stopped at all\ncost?""\n\nThe other cleared his throat. ""You are given carte blanche, Donaldson.\nYou and our other operatives in the Sahara and Sudan. Stop El Hassan.""\n\nRex Donaldson said flatly, ""You have just received my resignation, Sir\nWinton.""\n\n""What ... what!""\n\n""You heard me,"" Donaldson said.\n\n""But ... but what are you going to do?"" The heavy face of the African\nDepartment head was going a reddish-purple, which rather fascinated\nDonaldson but he had no time to further contemplate the phenomenon.\n\n""I\'m going to round up a few of my colleagues, of similar mind to my\nown, and then I\'m going to join El Hassan,"" the little man snapped.\n""Good-bye, Sir Winton.""\n\nHe clicked the set off and then looked down at it. His dour face broke\ninto a rare grin. ""Now there\'s an ambition I\'ve had for donkey\'s\nyears,"" he said aloud. ""To hang up on a really big mucky-muck.""\n\n\nIV\n\nFollowing the attack of the unidentified rocketcraft, El Hassan\'s\nparty was twice again nearly flushed by reconnoitering planes of\nunknown origin. They weren\'t making the time they wanted.\n\nBeneath a projecting rock face over a gravel bottomed wadi, the two\nhover-lorries were hidden, whilst a slow-moving helio-jet made\nsweeping, high-altitude circlings above them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe six stared glumly upward.\n\nCliff Jackson who was on the radio called out, ""I just picked him up.\nHe\'s called in to Fort Lamy reporting no luck. His fuel\'s running\nshort and he\'ll be knocking off soon.""\n\nHomer Crawford rapped, ""What language?""\n\n""French,"" Cliff said, ""but it\'s not his. I mean he\'s not French, just\nusing the language.""\n\nBey\'s face was as glum as any and there was a tic at the side of his\nmouth. He said now, ""We\'ve got to come up with something. Sooner or\nlater one of them will spot us and this next time we won\'t have any\nfantastic breaks like Homer being able to knock him off with a\nTommy-Noiseless. He\'ll drop a couple of neopalms and burn up a square\nmile of desert including El Hassan and his whole crew.""\n\nHomer looked at him. ""Any ideas, Bey?""\n\n""No,"" the other growled.\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""Any of the rest of you?""\n\nIsobel was frowning, bringing something back. ""Why don\'t we travel at\nnight?""\n\n""And rest during the day?"" Homer said.\n\nKenny said, ""Parking where? We just made it to this wadi. If we\'re\ncaught out in the dunes somewhere when one of those planes shows up,\nwe\'ve had it. You couldn\'t hide a jackrabbit out there.""\n\nBut Bey and Homer Crawford were still looking at Isobel.\n\nShe said, ""I remember a story the Tuaregs used to tell about a raid\nsome of them made back during the French occupation. They stole four\nhundred camels near Timbuktu one night and headed north. The French\nweren\'t worried. The next morning, they simply sent out a couple of\naircraft to spot the Tuareg raiders and the camels. Like Kenny said,\nyou couldn\'t hide a jackrabbit in dune country. But there was nothing\nto be seen. The French couldn\'t believe it, but they still weren\'t\nreally worried. After all a camel herd can travel only thirty or so\nmiles a day. So the next day the planes went out again, circling,\ncircling, but they still didn\'t spot the thieves and their loot, nor\nthe next day. Well, to shorten it, the Tuareg got their four hundred\ncamels all the way up to Spanish Rio de Oro where they sold them.""\n\nShe had their staring attention. ""How?"" Elmer blurted.\n\n""It was simple. They traveled all night and then, at dawn, buried the\ncamels and themselves in the sand and stayed there all day.""\n\nHomer said, ""I\'m sold. Boys, I hope you\'re in physical trim because\nthere\'s going to be quite a bit of digging for the next few days.""\n\nCliff groaned. ""Some Minister of the Treasury,"" he complained. ""They\ngive him a shovel instead of a bankbook.""\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\nBey said, ""Well, I suppose we stay here until nightfall.""\n\n""Right,"" Homer said. ""Whose turn is it to pull cook duty?""\n\nIsobel said menacingly, ""I don\'t know whose turn it is, but I know I\'m\ngoing to do the cooking. After that slumgullion Kenny whipped up\nyesterday, I\'m a perpetual volunteer for the job of chef--strictly in\nself-defense.""\n\n""That was a cruel cut,"" Kenny protested, ""however, I hereby relinquish\nall my rights to cooking for this expedition.""\n\n""And me!""\n\n""And me!""\n\n""O.K.,"" Homer said, ""so Isobel is Minister of the Royal Kitchen."" He\nlooked at Elmer Allen. ""Which reminds me. You\'re our junior\ntheoretician. Are we a monarchy?""\n\nElmer Allen scowled sourly and sat down, his back to the wadi wall. ""I\nwouldn\'t think so.""\n\nIsobel went off to make coffee in the portable galley in the rear of\nthe second hovercraft. The others brought forth tobacco and squatted\nor sat near the dour Jamaican. Years in the desert had taught them the\nnomad\'s ability to relax completely given opportunity.\n\n""So if it\'s not a monarchy, what\'ll we call El Hassan?"" Kenny\ndemanded.\n\nElmer said slowly, thoughtfully, ""We\'ll call him simply _El Hassan_.\nMonarchies are of the past, and El Hassan is the voice of the future,\nsomething new. We won\'t admit he\'s just a latter-day tyrant, an\nopportunist seizing power because it\'s there crying to be seized.\nActually, El Hassan is in the tradition of Genghis Khan, Tamerlane,\nor, more recently, Napoleon. But he\'s a modern version, and we\'re not\ngoing to hang the old labels on him.""\n\nIsobel had brought the coffee. ""I think you\'re right,"" she said.\n\n""Sold,"" Homer agreed. ""So we aren\'t a monarchy. We\'re a tyranny."" His\nface had begun by expressing amusement, but that fell off. He added,\n""As a young sociologist, I never expected to wind up a literal\ntyrant.""\n\nElmer Allen said, ""Wait a minute. See if I can remember this. Comes\nfrom Byron."" He closed his eyes and recited:\n\n    ""The tyrant of the Chersonese\n       Was freedom\'s best and bravest friend.\n     That tyrant was Miltiades,\n       Oh that the present hour would lend\n     Another despot of the kind.\n     Such bonds as his were sure to bind.""\n\nIsobel, pouring coffee, laughed and said, ""Why Elmer, who\'d ever dream\nyou read verse, not to speak of memorizing it, you old sourpuss.""\n\nElmer Allen\'s complexion was too dark to register a flush.\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""Yeah, Miltiades. Seized power, whipped the\nAthenians into shape to the point where they were able to take the\nPersians at Marathon, which should have been impossible."" He looked\naround at the others, winding up with Elmer. ""What happened to\nMiltiades after Marathon and after the emergency was over?""\n\nElmer looked down into his coffee. ""I don\'t remember,"" he lied.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a clicking from the first hover-lorry, and Cliff Jackson put\ndown his coffee, groaned his resentment at fate, and made his way to\nthe vehicle and the radio there.\n\nBey motioned with his head. ""That\'s handy, our still being able to\ntune in on the broadcasts the African Development Project makes to its\nteams.""\n\nKenny said, ""Not that what they\'ve been saying is much in the way of\nflattery.""\n\nBey said, ""They seem to think we\'re somewhere in the vicinity of Bidon\nCinq.""\n\n""That\'s what worries me,"" Homer growled. He raked his right hand back\nthrough his short hair. ""If they think we\'re in Southern Algeria, what\nare these planes doing around here? We\'re hundreds of miles from Bidon\nCinq.""\n\nBey shot him an oblique glance. ""That\'s easy. That plane that tried to\nclobber us, and these others that have been trying to search us out,\naren\'t really Reunited Nations craft. They\'re someone else.""\n\nThey all looked at him. ""Who?"" Isobel said.\n\n""How should I know? It could be almost anybody with an iron in the\nNorth African fire. The Soviet Complex? Very likely. The British\nCommonwealth or the French Community? Why not? There\'re elements in\nboth that haven\'t really accepted giving up the old colonies and would\nlike to regain them in one way or the other. The Arab Union? Why\ncomment? Common Europe? Oh, Common Europe would love to have a free\nhand exploiting North Africa.""\n\n""You haven\'t mentioned the United States of the Americas,"" Elmer said\ndryly. ""I hope you haven\'t any prejudices in favor of the land of your\nadoption, Mr. Minister of War.""\n\nBey shrugged. ""I just hadn\'t got around to her. Admittedly with the\ncontinued growth of the Soviet Complex and Common Europe, the States\nhave slipped from the supreme position they occupied immediately\nfollowing the Second War. The more power-happy elements are conscious\nof the ultimate value of control of Africa and doubly conscious of the\ndanger of it falling into the hands of someone else. Oh, never fear,\nthose planes that have been pestering us might belong to anybody at\nall.""\n\nCliff Jackson hurried back from his radio, his face anxious. ""Listen,""\nhe said. ""That was a high priority flash, to all Reunited Nations\nteams. The Arab Union has just taken Tamanrasset. They pushed two\ncolumns out of Libya, evidently one from Ghat and one from further\nnorth near GhademÃ¨s.""\n\nHomer Crawford was on his feet, alert. ""Well ... why?""\n\nCliff had what amounted to accusation on his face. ""Evidently, the El\nHassan rumors are spreading like wildfire. There\'ve been more riots in\nMopti, and the Reunited Nations buildings in Adrar have been stormed\nby mobs demonstrating for him. The Arab Union is moving in on the\nexcuse of protecting the country against El Hassan.""\n\nKenny Ballalou groaned, ""They\'ll have half their Arab Legion in here\nbefore the week\'s out.""\n\nCliff finished with, ""The Reunited Nations is throwing a wingding.\nEverybody running around accusing and threatening, and, as per usual,\ngetting nowhere.""\n\nHomer Crawford\'s face was working in thought. He shook his head at\nKenny. ""I think you\'re wrong. They won\'t send the whole Arab Legion\nin. They\'ll be afraid to. They\'ll want to see first what everybody\nelse does. They know they can\'t stand up to a slugging match with any\nof the really big powers. They\'ll stick it out for a while and watch\ndevelopments. We have, perhaps, two weeks in which to operate.""\n\n""Operate?"" Cliff demanded. ""What do you mean, operate?""\n\nHomer\'s eyes snapped to him. ""I mean to recapture Tamanrasset from the\nArab Union, seize the radio and television station there, and proclaim\nEl Hassan\'s regime.""\n\nThe big Californian\'s eyes bugged at him. ""You mean the six of us?\nThere\'ll be ten thousand of them.""\n\n""No,"" Homer said decisively. ""Nothing like that number. Possibly a\nthousand, if that many. Logistics simply doesn\'t allow a greater\nnumber, not on such short notice. They\'ve put a thousand or so of\ntheir crack troops into the town. No more.""\n\nCliff wailed, ""What\'s the difference between a thousand and twenty\nthousand, so far as five men and a girl are concerned?""\n\nThe rest were saying nothing, but following the debate.\n\nCrawford explained, not to just Cliff but to all of them. ""Actually,\nthe Arab Union is doing part of our job for us. They\'ve openly\ndeclared that El Hassan is attempting to take over North Africa, that\nhe\'s raising the tribes. Well, good. We didn\'t have the facilities to\nmake the announcement ourselves. But now the whole world knows it.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n""That\'s right,"" Elmer said, his face characteristically sullen. ""Every\nnews agency in the world is playing up the El Hassan story. In a\nmatter of days, the most remote nomad encampment in the Sahara will\nknow of it, one way or the other.""\n\nHomer Crawford was pacing, socking his right fist into the palm of the\nleft. ""They\'ve given us a rallying _raison d\'etre_. These people might\nbe largely Moslem, especially in the north, but they have no love for\nthe Arab Union. For too long the slave raiders came down from the\nnortheast. Given time, Islam might have moved in on the whole of North\nAfrica. But not this way, not in military columns.""\n\nHe swung to Bey. ""You worked over in the Teda country, before joining\nmy team, and speak the Sudanic dialects. Head for there, Bey.\nProclaim El Hassan. Organize a column. We\'ll rendezvous at Tamanrasset\nin exactly two weeks.""\n\nBey growled, ""How am I supposed to get to Faya?""\n\n""You\'ll have to work that out yourself. Tonight we\'ll drop you near In\nGuezzam, they have one of the big solar pump, afforestation\ndevelopments there. You should be able to, ah, requisition a truck, or\npossibly even a \'copter or aircraft. You\'re on your own, Bey.""\n\n""Right.""\n\nHomer spun to Kenny Ballalou. ""You\'re the only one of us who gets\nalong in the dialect of Hassania. Get over to Nemadi country and raise\na column. There are no better scouts in the world. Two weeks from\ntoday at Tamanrasset.""\n\n""Got it. Drop me off tonight with Bey, we\'ll work together until we\nliberate some transport.""\n\nBey said, ""It might be worth while scouting in In Guezzam for a day or\ntwo. We might pick up a couple of El Hassan followers to help us along\nthe way.""\n\n""Use your judgment. Elmer!""\n\nElmer groaned sourly, ""I knew my time\'d come.""\n\n""Up into Chaambra country for you. Take the second lorry. You\'ve got a\ndistance to go. Try to recruit former members of the French Camel\nCorps. Promise just about anything, but only remember that one day\nwe\'ll have to keep the promises. El Hassan can\'t get the label of\nphony hung on him.""\n\n""Chaambra country,"" Elmer said. ""Oh great. Arabs. I can just see what\nluck I\'m going to have rousing up Arabs to fight other Arabs, and me\nwith a complexion black as ...""\n\nHomer snapped at him, ""They won\'t be following you, they\'ll be\nfollowing El Hassan ... or at least the El Hassan dream. Play up the\nfact that the Arab Union is largely not of Africa but of the Middle\nEast. That they\'re invading the country to swipe the goats and violate\nthe women. Dig up all the old North African prejudices against the\nSyrians and Egyptians, and the Saudi-Arabian slave traders. You\'ll\nmake out.""\n\nCliff said, nervously, ""How about me, Homer?""\n\nHomer looked at him. Cliff Jackson, in spite of his fabulous build,\nhadn\'t a fighting man\'s background.\n\nHomer grinned and said, ""You\'ll work with me. We\'re going into Tuareg\ncountry. Whenever occasion calls for it, whip off that shirt and go\nstrolling around with that overgrown chest of yours stuck out. The\nTuareg consider themselves the best physical specimens in the Sahara,\nwhich they are. They admire masculine physique. You\'ll wow them.""\n\nCliff grumbled, ""Sounds like vaudeville.""\n\nIsobel said softly, ""And me, El Hassan? What do I do?""\n\nHomer turned to her. ""You\'re also part of headquarters staff. The\nTuareg women aren\'t dominated by their men. They still have a strong\nelement of descent in the matrilinear line and women aren\'t\nsecond-class citizens. You\'ll work on pressuring them. Do you speak\nTamaheq?""\n\n""Of course.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked up into the sky, swept it. The day was rapidly\ncoming to an end and nowhere does day become night so quickly as in\nthe ergs of the Sahara.\n\n""Let\'s get underway,"" Crawford said. ""Time\'s a wastin\'.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe range of the Ahaggar Tuareg was once known, under French\nadministration, as the Annexe du Hoggar, and was the most difficult\narea ever subdued by French arms--if it was ever subdued. At the\nbattle of Tit on May 7, 1902 the Camel Corps, under Cottenest, broke\nthe combined military power of the Tuareg confederations, but this\nmeant no more than that the tribes and clans carried on nomadic\nwarfare in smaller units.\n\nThe Ahaggar covers roughly an area the size of Pennsylvania, New York,\nVirginia and Maryland combined, and supports a population of possibly\ntwelve thousand, which includes about forty-five hundred Tuareg, four\nthousand Negro serf-slaves, and some thirty-five hundred scorned\nsedentary Haratin workers. The balance of the population consists of a\nhandful of Enaden smiths and a small number of Arab shopkeepers in the\nlargest of the sedentary centers. Europeans and other whites are all\nbut unknown.\n\nIt is the end of the world.\n\nContrary to Hollywood-inspired belief, the Sahara does not consist\nprincipally of sand dunes, although these, too, are present, and all\nbut impassable even to camels. Traffic, through the millennia, has\nheld to the endless stretches of gravelly plains and the rock ribbed\nplateaus which cover most of the desert. The great sandy wastes or\nergs cover roughly a fifth of the entire Sahara, and possibly two\nthirds of this area consists of the rolling sandy plains dotted\noccasionally with dunes. The remaining third, or about one fifteenth\nof the total Sahara, is characterized by the dune formations of\npopular imagination.\n\nIt was through this latter area that Homer Crawford, now with but one\nhover-lorry, and accompanied by Isobel Cunningham and Clifford\nJackson, was heading.\n\nFor although the spectacular major dune formations of the Great Erg\nhave defied wheeled vehicles since the era of the Carthaginian\nchariots, and even the desert born camel limits his daily travel in\nthem to but a few miles, the modern hovercraft, atop its air cushion\njets, finds them of only passing difficulty to traverse. And the\nhovercraft leaves no trail.\n\nCliff Jackson scowled out at the identical scenery. Identical for more\nthan two hundred miles. For twice that distance, they had seen no\nother life. No animal, no bird, not a sprig of cactus. This was the\nGreat Erg.\n\nHe muttered, ""This country is so dry even the morning dew is\ndehydrated.""\n\nIsobel laughed--she, too, had never experienced this country before.\n""Why, Cliff, you made a funny!""\n\nThey were sitting three across in the front seat, with Homer Crawford\nat the wheel, and now all three were dressed in the costume of the Kel\nRela tribe of the Ahaggar Tuareg confederation. In the back of the\nlorry were the jerry-cans of water and the supplies that meant the\ndifference between life and mummification from sun and heat.\n\nCliff turned suddenly to the driver. ""Why here?"" he said bitterly.\n""Why pick this for a base of operations? Why not Mopti? Ten thousand\nSudanese demonstrated for El Hassan there less than two weeks ago.\nYou\'d have them in the palm of your hand.""\n\nHomer didn\'t look up from his work at wheel, lift and acceleration\nlevers. To achieve maximum speed over the dunes, you worked constantly\nat directing motion not only horizontally but vertically.\n\nHe said, ""And the twenty and one enemies of the El Hassan movement\nwould have had us in their palms. Our followers in Mopti can take care\nof themselves. If this movement is ever going to be worth anything,\nthe local characters are going to have to get into the act. The\ncurrent big thing is not to allow El Hassan and his immediate troupe\nto be eliminated before full activities can get under way. For the\npresent, we\'re hiding out until we can gather forces enough to free\nTamanrasset.""\n\n""Hiding out is right,"" Cliff snorted. ""I have a sneaking suspicion\nthat not only will they never find us, but we\'ll never find them\nagain.""\n\nHomer laughed. ""As a matter of fact, we\'re not so far right now from\nSilet where there\'s a certain amount of water--if you dig for it--and\na certain amount of the yellowish grass and woody shrubs that the\nbedouin depend on. With luck, we\'ll find the Amenokal of the Tuareg\nthere.""\n\n""Amenokal?""\n\n""Paramount chief of the Ahaggar Tuaregs.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dunes began to fall away and with the butt of his left hand\nCrawford struck the acceleration lever. He could make more time now\nwhen less of his attention was drawn to the ups and downs of erg\ntravel.\n\nPatches of thorny bush began to appear, and after a time a small herd\nof gazelle were flushed and high tailed their way over the horizon.\n\nIsobel said, ""Who is this Amenokal you mentioned?""\n\n""These are the real Tuareg, the comparatively untouched. They\'ve got\nthree tribes, the Kel Rela, the TÃ©gÃ©hÃ© Mellet and the Taitoq, each\nheaded by a warrior clan which gives its name to the tribe as a whole.\nThe chief of the Kel Rela clan is also chief of the Kel Rela tribe and\nautomatically paramount chief, or Amenokal, of the whole\nconfederation. His name is Melchizedek.""\n\n""Do you think you can win him over?"" Isobel said.\n\n""He\'s a smart old boy. I had some dealings with him over a year ago.\nGave him a TV set in the way of a present, hoping he\'d tune in on some\nof our Reunited Nations propaganda. He\'s probably the most\nconservative of the Tuareg leaders.""\n\nHer eyebrows went up. ""And you expect to bring him around to the most\nliberal scheme to hit North Africa since Hannibal?""\n\nHe looked at her from the side of his eyes and grinned. ""Remember\nRoosevelt, the American president?""\n\n""Hardly.""\n\n""Well, you\'ve read about him. He came into office at a time when the\ncountry was going to economic pot by the minute. Some of the measures\nhe and his so-called brain trust took were immediately hailed by his\nenemies as socialistic. In answer, Roosevelt told them that in times\nof social stress the true conservative is a liberal, since to\npreserve, you have to reform. If Roosevelt hadn\'t done the things he\ndid, back in the 1930s, you probably would have seen some _real_\nchanges in the American socio-economic system. Roosevelt didn\'t\nundermine the social system of the time, he preserved it.""\n\n""Then, according to you, Roosevelt was a conservative,"" she said\nmockingly.\n\nCrawford laughed. ""I\'ll go even further,"" he said. ""When social\nchanges are pending and for whatever reason are not brought about,\nthen reaction is the inevitable alternative. At such a time then--when\nsweeping socio-economic change is called for--any reform measures\nproposed are concealed measures of reaction, since they tend to\nmaintain the _status quo_.""\n\n""Holy Mackerel,"" Cliff protested. ""Accept that and Roosevelt was not\nonly not a liberal, but a reactionary. Stop tearing down my childhood\nheroes.""\n\nIsobel said, ""Let\'s get back to this Amenokal guy. You think he\'s\nsmart enough to see his only chance is in going along with ...""\n\nHomer Crawford pointed ahead and a little to the right. ""We\'ll soon\nfind out. This is a favorite encampment of his. With luck, he\'ll be\nthere. If we can win him over, we\'ve come a long way.""\n\n""And if we can\'t?"" Isobel said, her eyebrows raised again.\n\n""Then it\'s unfortunate that there are only three of us,"" Homer said\nsimply, without looking at her.\n\nThere were possibly no more than a hundred Tuareg in all in the nomad\nencampment of goat leather tents when the solar powered hovercraft\ndrew up.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen the air cushion vehicle stopped before the largest tent, Crawford\nsaid beneath his breath, ""The Amenokal is here, all right. Cliff,\nwatch your teguelmoust. If any of these people see more than your\neyes, your standing has dropped to a contemptible zero.""\n\nThe husky Californian secured the lightweight cotton, combination veil\nand turban well up over his face. Earlier, Crawford had shown him how\nto wind the ten-foot long, indigo-blue cloth around the head and\nfeatures.\n\nIsobel, of course, was unveiled, Tuareg fashion, and wore baggy\ntrousers of black cotton held in place with a braided leather cord by\nway of drawstring and a gandoura upper-garment consisting of a huge\nrectangle of cloth some seven to eight feet square and folded over on\nitself with the free corners sewed together so as to leave bottom and\nmost of both sides open. A V-shaped opening for her head and neck was\ncut out of a fold at the top, and a large patch had been sewed inside\nto make a pocket beneath her left breast. She wasn\'t exactly a\nParisian fashion plate.\n\nEven as they stepped down from the hovercraft, immediately after it\nhad drifted to rest on the ground, an elderly man came from the tent\nentrance.\n\nHe looked at them for a moment, then rested his eyes exclusively on\nHomer Crawford.\n\n""_La Bas_, El Hassan,"" he said through the cloth that covered his\nmouth.\n\nHomer Crawford was taken aback, but covered the fact. ""There is no\nevil,"" he repeated the traditional greeting. ""But why do you name me\nEl Hassan?""\n\nA dozen veiled desert men, all with the Tuareg sword, several with\nmodern rifles, had formed behind the Tuareg chief.\n\nMelchizedek made a movement of hand to mouth, in a universal gesture\nof amusement. ""Ah, El Hassan,"" he said, ""you forget you left me the\nmagical instrument of the Roumi.""\n\nCrawford was mystified, but he stood in silence. What the Tuareg\nparamount chief said now made considerable difference. As he recalled\nhis former encounter with the Ahaggar leader, the other had been\nneither friendly nor antagonistic to the Reunited Nations team\nCrawford had headed in their role as itinerant desert smiths.\n\nThe Amenokal said, ""Enter then my tent, El Hassan, and meet my\nchieftains. We would confer with you.""\n\nThe first obstacle was cleared. Subduing a sigh of relief, Homer\nCrawford turned to Cliff. ""This, O Amenokal of all the Ahaggar, is\nClif ben Jackson, my Vizier of Finance.""\n\nThe Amenokal bowed his head slightly, said, ""_La Bas_.""\n\nCliff could go that far in the Tuareg tongue. He said, ""_La Bas_.""\n\nThe Amenokal said, looking at Isobel, ""I hear that in the lands of the\nRoumi women are permitted in the higher councils.""\n\nHomer said steadily, ""This I have also been amazed to hear. However,\nit is fitting that my followers remain here while El Hassan discusses\nmatters of the highest importance with the Amenokal and his\nchieftains. This is the Sitt Izubahil, high in the councils of her\npeople due to the great knowledge she has gained by attending the new\nschools which dispense rare wisdom, as all men know.""\n\nThe Amenokal courteously said, ""_La Bas_,"" but Isobel held her peace\nin decency amongst men of chieftain rank.\n\nWhen Homer and the Tuaregs had disappeared into the tent, she said to\nCliff, ""Stick by the car, I\'m going to circulate among the women.\nWomen are women everywhere. I\'ll pick up the gossip, possibly get\nsomething Homer will miss in there.""\n\nA group of Tuareg women and children, the latter stark naked, had\ngathered to gape at the strangers. Isobel moved toward them, began\nimmediately breaking the ice.\n\nUnder his breath, Cliff muttered, ""What a gal. Give her a few hours\nand she\'ll form a Lady\'s Aid branch, or a bridge club, and where else\nis El Hassan going to pick up so much inside information?""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tent, which was of the highly considered mouflon skins, was\nmounted on a wooden frame which consisted of two uprights with a\nhorizontal member laid across their tops. The tent covering was\nstretched over this framework with its back and sides pegged down and\nthe front, which faced south, was left open. It was ten feet deep,\nfifteen feet wide and five feet high in the middle.\n\nThe men entered and filed to the right of the structure where\nsheepskins and rugs provided seating. The women and children, who\nabided ordinarily to the left side, had vanished for this gathering of\nthe great.\n\nThey sat for a time and sipped at green tea, syrup sweet with mint and\nsugar, the tiny cups held under the teguelmoust so as not to obscenely\nreveal the mouth of the drinker.\n\nFinally, Homer Crawford said, ""You spoke of the magical instrument of\nthe Roumi which I gave you as gift, O Amenokal, and named me El\nHassan.""\n\nSeveral of the Tuareg chuckled beneath their veils but Crawford could\nread neither warmth nor antagonism in their amusement.\n\nThe elderly Melchizedek nodded. ""At first we were bewildered, O El\nHassan, but then my sister\'s son, GuÃ©mama, fated perhaps one day to\nbecome chief of the Kel Rela and Amenokal of all the Ahaggar, recalled\nthe tales told by the storytellers at the fire in the long evenings.""\n\nCrawford looked at him politely.\n\nMelchizedek\'s laugh was gentle. ""But each man has heard, in his time,\nO El Hassan, of the ancient Calif Haroun El Raschid of Baghdad.""\n\nCrawford\'s mind went into high gear, as the story began to come back\nto him. From second into high gear, and he could have blessed these\nbedouin for handing him a piece of publicity gobblydygook worthy of\nFifth Avenue\'s top agency.\n\nHe held up a hand as though in amusement at being discovered.\n""Wallahi, O Amenokal, you have discovered my secret. For many months I\nhave crossed the deserts disguised as a common Enaden smith to seek\nout all the people and to learn their wishes and their needs.""\n\n""Even as Haroun el Raschid in the far past,"" one of the subchiefs\nmuttered in satisfaction, ""used to disguise himself as a lowborn\ndragoman and wander the streets of Baghdad.""\n\n""But how did you recognize me?"" Homer said.\n\nThe Amenokal said in reproof, ""But verily, your name is on all lips.\nThe Roumi have branded you common criminal. You are to be seized on\nsight and great reward will be given he who delivers you to the\nauthorities."" He spoke without inflection, and Crawford could read\nneither support nor animosity--nor greed for the reward offered by El\nHassan\'s enemies. He gathered the impression that the Tuareg chief was\nplaying his cards close to his chest.\n\n""And what else do they say?""\n\nThe elderly Melchizedek went on slowly, ""They say that El Hassan is in\ntruth a renegade citizen of a far away Roumi land and that he attempts\nto build a great confederation in North Africa for his own gain.""\n\nOne of the others chuckled and said, ""The Roumi on the magical\ninstrument are indeed great liars as all can see.""\n\nHomer looked at him questioningly.\n\nThe other said, laughing, ""Who has ever heard of a black Roumi? And\nyou, O El Hassan, are as black as a Bela.""\n\nThe Amenokal finished off the mystery of Crawford\'s recognition.\n""Know, El Hassan, that whilst you were here before, one of the slaves\nthat served you for pay shamelessly looked upon your face in the\nprivacy of your tent. It was this slave who recognized your face when\nthe Roumi presented it on the magic instrument, calling upon all men\nto see you and to brand you enemy.""\n\nSo that was it. The Reunited Nations, and probably all the rest, had\nused their radio and TV stations to broadcast a warning and offer a\nreward for Homer and his followers. Old Sven was losing no time. This\nwasn\'t so good. A Tuareg owes allegiance to no one beyond clan, tribe\nand confederation. All others are outside the pale and any advantage,\nmonetary or otherwise, to be gained by exploiting a stranger is well\nwithin desert mores.\n\nHe might as well bring it to the point. Crawford said evenly, ""And I\nhave entered your camp alone except for two followers. Your people are\nmany. So why, O Amenokal, have you not seized me for the reward the\nRoumi offer?""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a moment of silence and Homer Crawford sensed that the\nsub-chieftains had leaned forward in anticipation, waiting for their\nleader\'s words. Possibly they, too, could not understand.\n\nThe Tuareg leader finished his tea.\n\n""Because, El Hassan, we yet have not heard the message which the Roumi\nare so anxious that you not be allowed to bring the men of the desert.\nThe Roumi are great liars, and great thieves, as each man knows. In\nthe memory of those still living, they have stolen of the bedouin and\nrobbed him of land and wealth. So now we would hear of what you say,\nbefore we decide.""\n\n""Spoken like a true Amenokal, a veritable Suliman ben Davud,"" Homer\nsaid with a heartiness he could only partly feel. At least they were\nopen to persuasion.\n\nFor a long moment he stared down at the rug upon which they sat, as\nthough deep in contemplation.\n\n""These words I speak will be truly difficult to hear and accept, O men\nof the veil,"" he said at last. ""For I speak of great change, and no\nman loves change in the way of his life.""\n\n""Speak, El Hassan,"" Melchizedek said flatly. ""Great change is\neverywhere upon us, as each man knows, and none can tell how to\nmaintain the ways of our fathers.""\n\n""We can fight,"" one of the younger men growled.\n\nThe Amenokal turned to him and grunted scorn. ""And would you fight\nagainst the weapons of the djinn and afrit, O GuÃ©mama? Know that in my\nyouth I was distant witness to the explosion of a great weapon which\nthe accursed Franzawi discharged south of Reggan. Know, that this\nsingle explosion, my sister\'s son, could with ease have destroyed the\ntotal of all the tribesmen of the Ahaggar, had they been gathered.""\n\n""And the Roumi have many such weapons,"" Crawford added gently.\n\nThe eyes of the tribal headmen came back to him.\n\n""As each man knows,"" Crawford continued, ""change is upon the world. No\nmatter how strongly one wills to continue the traditions of his\nfathers, change is upon us all. And he who would press against the\nsand storm, rather than drifting with it, lasts not long.""\n\nOne of the subchiefs growled, ""We Tuareg love not change, El Hassan.""\n\nCrawford turned to him. ""That is why I and my viziers have spent long\nhours in _ekhwan_, in great council, devoted to the problems of the\nTuareg and how they can best fit into the new Africa that everywhere\nawakes.""\n\nThey stirred in interest now. The Tuareg, once the Scourge of the\nSahara, the Sons of Shaitan and the Forgotten of Allah, to the Arab,\nTeda, Moroccan and other fellow inhabitants of North Africa, were of\nrecent decades developing a tribal complex. Robbed of their\nnomadic-bandit way of life by first the French Camel Corps and later\nby the efforts of the Reunited Nations, they were rapidly descending\ninto a condition of poverty and defensive bewilderment. Not only were\nlarge numbers of former bedouin drifting to the area\'s sedentary\ncenters, an act beyond contempt within the memory of the elders, but\nthe best elements of the clans were often deserting Tuareg country\ncompletely and defecting to the new industrial centers, the dam\nprojects, the afforestation projects, the new oases irrigated with the\nsolar-powered pumps.\n\n""Speak, El Hassan,"" the Amenokal ordered. And unconsciously, he, too,\nleaned forward, as did his subchiefs. The Ahaggar Tuareg were reaching\nfor straws, unconsciously seeking shoulders upon which to lay their\nunsolvable problems.\n\n""Let me, O chiefs of the Tuareg, tell of a once strong tribe of\nwarriors and nomads who lived in the far country in which I was born,""\nCrawford said. The desert man loves a story, a parable, a tale of the\nstrong men of yesteryear.\n\nMelchizedek clapped his hands in summons and when a slave appeared,\ncalled for _narghileh_ water pipes. When all had been supplied, they\nrelaxed, bits in mouths and looked again at Homer Crawford.\n\n""They were called,"" he intoned, ""the Cheyenne. The Northern Cheyenne,\nfor they had a sister tribe to the South. And on all the plains of\nthis great land, a land, verily, as large as all that over which the\nTuareg confederations now roam, they were the greatest huntsmen, the\ngreatest warriors. All feared them. They were the lords of all.""\n\n""Ai,"" breathed one of the older men. ""As were the Tuareg before the\ncoming of the cursed Franzawi and the other Nazrani.""\n\n""But in time,"" Crawford pursued, ""came the new ways to the plains, and\nthese men who lived largely by the chase began to see the lands fenced\nin for farmers, began to see large cities erected on what were once\ntribal areas, and to see the iron railroads of the new ways begin to\nspread out over the whole of the territory which once was roamed only\nby the Cheyennes and such nomadic tribes.""\n\n""Ai,"" a muffled mouth ejected.\n\nHomer Crawford looked at the younger Targui, GuÃ©mama, the Amenokal\'s\nnephew. ""And so,"" he said, ""they fought.""\n\n""Wallahi!"" GuÃ©mama breathed.\n\nHomer Crawford looked about the circle. ""Never has tribe fought as did\nthe Cheyenne. Never has the world seen such warriors, with the\nexception, of course, of the Ahaggar Tuareg. Never were such raids,\nnever such bravery, never such heroic deeds as were performed by the\nwarriors of the Cheyennes and their women, and their old people and\ntheir children. Over and over they defeated the cavalry and the\ninfantry of the newcomers who would change the old ways and bring the\nnew to the lands of the Cheyennes.""\n\nThe bedouin were staring in fascination, their water pipes forgotten.\n\n""And then...?"" the Amenokal demanded.\n\n""The new ways taught the enemy how to make guns, and artillery, and\nfinally Gatling guns, which today we call machine guns. And once a\nbrave warrior might prevail against a common man armed with the\nweapons of the new ways, and even twice he might. But the numbers of\nthe followers of the new ways are as the sands of the Great Erg and in\ntime bravery means nothing.""\n\n""It is even so,"" someone growled. ""They are as the sands of the erg,\nand they have the weapons of the djinn, as each man knows.""\n\n""And what happened in the end, O El Hassan?""\n\nHis eyes swept them all. ""They perished,"" Homer said. ""Today in all\nthe land where once the Cheyenne pursued the game there is but a\nhandful of the tribe alive. And they have become nothing people, no\nlonger warriors, no longer nomads, and they are scorned by all for\nthey are poor, poor, poor. Poor in mind and spirits, and in property\nand they have not been able to adjust to the ways of the new world.""\n\nAir went out of the lungs of the assembled Tuareg.\n\nThe Amenokal looked at him. ""This is verily the truth, El Hassan?""\n\n""My head upon it,"" Crawford said.\n\n""And why do you tell us of these Cheyenne, these great warriors of the\nplains of the land of your birth? The story fails to bring joy to\nhearts already heavy with the troubles of the Tuareg.""\n\nIt was time to play the joker.\n\nCrawford said carefully, ""Because there was no need, O Amenokal of all\nthe Ahaggar, for the Cheyenne to disappear before the sandstorm of the\nfuture. They could have ridden before it and today occupy a position\nof honor and affluence in their former land.""\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n""And give up the old ways?"" GuÃ©mama demanded. ""Become no longer\nnomads, no longer honorable warriors, but serfs, slaves, working with\none\'s hands upon the land and with the oil-dirty machines of the\nRoumi?""\n\nThe chiefs muttered angrily.\n\nCrawford said hurriedly, ""No! Never! In our great conferences, my\nviziers and I decided that the Tuareg could never so change. The\nTuareg must die, as did the Northern Cheyenne before he would become a\ncity dweller, a worker of the land.""\n\n""Bismillah!"" someone muttered.\n\n""Too often,"" Crawford explained, ""do the bringers of these things of\nthe future, be they Roumi or others, fail to utilize the potential\nservices of the people of the lands they over-sweep.""\n\n""I do not understand you, El Hassan,"" Melchizedek grumbled. ""There is\nno room for the Tuareg in this new world of bringing trees to the\ndesert, of the great trucks which speed across the erg a score of time\nthe pace of a _hejin_ racing camel, of larger and ever larger oases\nwith their great towns, their schools, their new industries. If the\nTuareg remains Tuareg, he cannot fit into this new world, it destroys\nthe old traditions, the old way which is the Tuareg way.""\n\nHomer Crawford now turned on the pressure. His voice took on overtones\nof the positive, his personality seemed to reach out and seize them,\nand even his physical stature seemed to grow.\n\n""Some indeed of the ways of the bedouin must go,"" he entoned, ""but the\nTuareg will survive under my leadership. A people who have throve a\nmillennium and more in the great wastes of the Sahara have strong\nsurvival characteristics and will blossom, not die, in my new world.\nKnow, O Melchizedek, that it has been decided that the Ahaggar Tuareg\nwill be the heart of my Desert Legion. In times of conflict, armed\nwith the new arms, and riding the new vehicles, they will adapt their\nold methods of warfare to this new age. In times of peace they will\npatrol the new forests, watching for fire and other disaster, they\nwill become herdsmen of the new herds and be the police and rescue\nforces of this wide area. As the Cheyennes of the olden times of the\nland of my birth could have become herdsmen and forest rangers and\nhave performed similar tasks had they been shown the way.""\n\nHomer Crawford let his eyes go from one of them to the next, and his\npersonality continued to dominate them.\n\nThe Amenokal ran his thin, aged hand through the length of his white\nbeard beneath his teguelmoust and contemplated this stranger come out\nof the ergs to lead his people to still greater changes than those\nthey had thus far rebelled against.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrawford realized that the Targui was divided in opinion and inwardly\nthe American was in a cold sweat. But his voice registered only\nsupreme confidence. ""Under my banner, all North Africa will be welded\ninto one. And all the products of the land will be available in\nprofusion to my faithful followers. The finest wheat for cous cous\nfrom Algeria and Tunis, the finest dates and fruits from the oases to\nthe north, the manufactured products of the factories of Dakar and\nCasablanca. For Africa has always been a poor land but will become a\nrich one with the new machines and techniques that I will bring.""\n\nThe Amenokal raised a hand to stem the tide of oratory. ""And what do\nyou ask of us now, El Hassan?""\n\nInstead of to the older man, Crawford turned his eyes to the face of\nGuÃ©mama, the leader of the young clansmen. ""Now my people are\ngathering to establish the new rule. Teda from the east, Chaambra from\nthe north, Sudanese from the south, Nemadi, Moors and Rifs from the\nwest. We rendezvous in ten days from now at Tamanrasset where the Arab\nLegion dogs have seized the city as they wish to seize all the lands\nof the Sahara and Sudan for the corrupt Arab Union politicians.""\n\nCrawford came to his feet. His voice took on an edge of command. ""You\nwill address your scouts and warriors and each will ride off on the\nswiftest camels at your command to raise the Tuareg tribes. And the\nclans of the Kel Rela will unite with the Taitoq and the TÃ©gÃ©hÃ© Mellet\nin a great harka at this point and we will ride together to sweep the\nArab Legion from the lands of El Hassan.""\n\nGuÃ©mama was on his feet, too. ""Bilhana!"" he roared. ""With joy.""\n\nThe others were arising in excitement, all but Melchizedek, who still\nstroked his gray streaked beard beneath his teguelmoust. The Amenokal\nhad seen much of desert war in his day and knew the horror of the new\nweapons possessed by the crack troops of the Arab Legion.\n\nBut his aged shoulders shrugged against the inevitable.\n\nCrawford said, the ring of authority in his voice. ""What does the\nAmenokal of all the Ahaggar say?"" He had no intention of antagonizing\nthe Tuareg chief by going over his head and directly to the people.\n\n""Thou art El Hassan,"" Melchizedek said, his voice low, ""and\nundoubtedly it is fated that the Tuareg follow you, for verily there\nis no way else to go, as each man knows.""\n\n""Wallahi!"" GuÃ©mama crowed jubilantly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nV\n\nGuÃ©mama, nephew of Melchizedek the Amenokal of the Ahaggar Tuareg\nconfederation and fighting chief of the Kel Rela clan of the Kel Rela\ntribe, brought his Hejin racing camel to an abrupt halt with a smack\nof his mish\'ab camel stick. He barked, ""_Adar-ya-yan_,"" in command to\nbring it to its knees, and slid to the ground before his mount had\ngroaned its rocking way to the sand.\n\nThe Tarqui was jubilant. His dark eyes sparked above his teguelmoust\nveil and he presented himself before Homer Crawford with the elan of a\nNapoleonic cavalryman before his emperor. Were red leather fil fil\nboots capable of producing a clicking of heels, that sound would have\nrung.\n\nCrawford said with dignity, ""Aselamu, Aleikum, GuÃ©mama. Greeting to\nyou.""\n\n""Salaam Aleikum,"" the tribesman got out breathlessly. ""Your message\nspreads, O El Hassan. My men ride to eastward and westward and never a\ntent from here to Silet, from In Guezzam to Timissao but knows that El\nHassan calls. The Taitoq and the TÃ©gÃ©hÃ© Mellet ride!""\n\nHomer Crawford was standing before the hovercraft. The Amenokal\'s\ntribesmen had set up two large goat leather tents for his use and the\nthree Americans had largely withdrawn to their shelter. Crawford was\naware of the dangers of familiarity.\n\nCliff Jackson, who as usual had been monitoring the radio, came from\nthe hover-lorry and growled, ""What\'s he saying?""\n\n""The tribesmen are gathering as per instructions,"" Homer said in\nEnglish.\n\nJackson grunted, somewhat self-conscious of the Targui\'s admiring\ngaze. The Tuareg is the handsomest physical specimen of North Africa,\noften going to six foot of wiry manhood, but there was nothing in all\nthe Sahara to rival the build of Homer Crawford, not to speak of the\ngiant Cliff Jackson.\n\nCrawford turned back to the Tuareg chieftain. ""You please me well, O\nGuÃ©mama. Know that I have been in conference with my viziers on the\nRoumi device which enables one to speak great distances and that we\nhave decided that you are to head all the fighting clans of the\nAhaggar, and that you will ride at the left hand of El Hassan, as\nshield on shoulder rides.""\n\nThe Targui, overwhelmed, made adequate pledges of fidelity, flowering\nwords of thanks, and then hurried off to inform his fellow tribesmen\nof his appointment.\n\nIsobel emerged from her tent. She looked at Homer obliquely, the sides\nof her mouth turning down. ""As shield on shoulder rides,"" she\ntranslated from the Tamaheq Berber tongue into English. ""Hm-m-m."" She\ncast her eyes upward in memory. ""You aren\'t plagiarizing Kipling, are\nyou?""\n\nCrawford grinned at her. ""These people like a well turned phrase.""\n\n""And who could turn them better than Rudyard?"" she said. Her voice\ndropped the bantering tone. ""What\'s this bit about making GuÃ©mama\nwar-chief of the Tuareg? Isn\'t he on the young and enthusiastic\nside?""\n\nCliff scowled. ""You mean that youngster? Why he can\'t be more than in\nhis early twenties.""\n\nCrawford was looking after the young Targui who was disappearing into\nhis uncle\'s tent on the far side of the rapidly growing encampment.\n\n""You mean the age of Napoleon in the Italian campaign, or Alexander at\nIssus?"" he asked. Isobel began to respond to that, but he shook his\nhead. ""He\'s the Amenokal\'s nephew, and traditionally would probably\nget the position anyway. He\'s the most popular of the young tribesmen,\nand it\'s going to be they who do the fighting. Having the appointment\ncome from El Hassan, and at this early point, will just bind him\ncloser. Besides that, he\'s a natural born warrior. Typical.\nEnthusiastic, bold, brave and with the military mind.""\n\n""What\'s a military mind?"" Cliff said.\n\n""He can take off his shirt without unbuttoning his collar,"" Homer told\nhim.\n\n""Very funny,"" Cliff grumbled.\n\nIsobel turned to the big Californian. ""What\'s on the radio, Cliff?""\n\n""Let\'s go get a cup of coffee,"" he said. ""All hellzapoppin.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went into the larger of the two Tuareg tents, and Isobel poured\nwater from a girba into the coffee pot which she placed on a heat\nunit, flicking its switch. She said sarcastically, from the side of\nher mouth, ""A message, O El Hassan, from the Department of Logistics,\nsubdepartment Commissary of Headquarters of the Commander in Chief.\nUnless you get around to capturing some supplies in the near future,\nyour food is going to be prepared over a camel dung fire. This heat\nunit is fading out on me.""\n\n""Don\'t bother me with trivialities,"" Homer told her. ""I\'ve got _big_\nthings on my mind.""\n\nShe looked at him suspiciously. ""Hm-m-m. Such as what?""\n\n""Such as whether to put my face on the postage stamps profile or\nfull.""\n\nShe said, under her breath, ""I shoulda known. Already, delusions of\ngrandeur.""\n\n""Holy Mackerel,"" Cliff protested. ""Aren\'t we ever serious around this\nplace? You two will wind up gagging with the firing squad.""\n\nCrawford chuckled softly but let his face go serious. ""Sorry, Cliff.\nWhat\'s on your mind?""\n\nCliff said impatiently, ""From the radio reports, the Arab Union is\nconsolidating its position. El Hassan is being discredited by the\nminute. Your followers were in control for a time in Mopti and Bamako,\nbut they\'re falling away because of lack of direction. The best way I\ncan put reports together, the Reunited Nations is in complete\nconfusion. Everybody accusing everybody of double-dealing.""\n\nIsobel said dryly, ""Any other good news?""\n\nCliff said glumly, ""Rumors, rumors, rumors. Half the marabouts in\nNorth Africa are proclaiming a jihad in support of the Pan-Islam\nprogram of the Arab Union. Listen, Homer, we\'ve got to get the\nbacking of the Moslem leaders.""\n\nHomer Crawford grunted. ""We need Islam in this part of the world like\nwe need a hole in the head. That\'s one of the things already wrong\nwith North Africa.""\n\n""What\'s wrong with Islam? It was probably the most dynamic religion\never to sweep the world.""\n\n""_Was_ is right,"" Crawford growled, now on one of his favorite peeve\nsubjects. ""The Moslem religion exploded out of Arabia with some new\nconcepts that set the world in ferment from India to Southern France.\nFor all practical purposes Islam _invented_ science. Sure, the Greeks\nhad logic and the Romans had engineering--without applying the\nGreek-style logic. But the Arabs amalgamated the two concepts to yield\nexperimental science. They were able to take the intellectual products\nof a dozen cultures and wield them into one. For a hundred years or so\nit looked as though they had something.""\n\nWhen he hesitated for a moment, Isobel said, questioningly, ""And ...""\n\n""And they couldn\'t get away from that Q\'ran of theirs. They took it\nseriously. They started off in their big universities, such as those\nat Fez, being the greatest scientists and scholars the world had ever\nseen. But the fundamentalists won out, and in a couple of hundred\nyears the only thing being taught at Fez was the Q\'ran. To even\nsuggest that all necessary information isn\'t contained therein, is\nenough to have you clobbered. Islam became the most reactionary force\nto suppress progress in the civilized world. In fact, by this period\nin world history, we don\'t even think of the Moslem world as\nparticularly civilized.""\n\nCliff said defensively, ""The Bible doesn\'t encourage original thinking\neither. A fundamentalist ...""\n\n""Sure,"" Crawford interrupted. ""Those elements who take the Bible the\nway Islam took the Q\'ran wind up in the same rut. But _as a whole_,\nEurope was sparked enough by the original Islamic explosion that the\nRenaissance resulted, with what world results we all know. Be ...""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a roar of confusion outside. A blasting of guns, a shrieking\nof _Ul-Ul-Ul-Allah Akbar!_\n\nCrawford came to his feet unhappily. ""Another contingent of Tuareg,""\nhe said. ""I\'ll have to give them a quick welcoming to the colors\nspeech.""\n\nThe guns outside continued their booming.\n\n""Confound it,"" he growled, ""I wish I could break them of that habit of\nblasting away their ammunition. They\'ll have better targets before the\nweek is out.""\n\nHe pushed open the tent flap and, followed by Isobel and Cliff,\nemerged into the stretch of clearing between his tents and the\nhovercraft, and the growing Tuareg encampment. His diagnosis had been\ncorrect. A contingent of possibly two score Tuareg camelmen had come\na-galloping up, shaking rifles above their heads in a small scale\ngymhana, or fantasia as the Moors called them.\n\n""At least it\'s a larger group than usual,"" Cliff said from behind.\n""But at this rate, it\'ll still take a month for us to equal the Arab\nLegion in Tamanrasset."" He added in disgust, ""And look at this bunch\nof ragamuffins. Half of them are carrying muzzleloaders.""\n\nThe booming muskets and the cracking rifles suddenly began to fall off\nin intensity and the camelmen and the hordes of Tuareg women and naked\nchildren who had swarmed from the tents to greet them were falling\nsilent. Here and there a hand pointed upward.\n\nHomer, Cliff and Isobel swung their own eyes up to the sky in dreaded\nanticipation. The hover-lorry was camouflaged to blend in with the\nsands and rock outcroppings of this area, but it was possible that an\naircraft might have determined that this was El Hassan\'s base,\npossibly through some act of a traitor, in which case ...\n\nThey found the spot in the sky that the tribesmen were pointing out.\nIt seemed to move slowly for a military craft, but for that matter it\nmight be a helio-jet and considerably more dangerous, so far as they\nbeing spotted was concerned, than a fast moving fighter.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGuÃ©mama, was barking to his men to take cover. Two days before\nCrawford had checked out several of the more bright-eyed on the flac\nrifle and now three of them ran to where it was set up at a high\npoint.\n\nBut hardly had the confused milling got under way than it fell off\nagain. Movement stopped, and the Tuareg faced the approaching dot in\nthe sky.\n\n""Djinn...!""\n\n""Afrit...!""\n\nCliff had darted back into the tent, now he emerged with binoculars.\n\n""What the devil is it?"" Crawford snapped. Desert trained eyes were\nevidently considerably more effective than his own. He couldn\'t see\nwhat the tribesmen were gaping at.\n\n""It\'s the smallest heliohopper _I\'ve_ ever seen,"" Cliff snorted. ""It\'s\nso small practically all you can see are the rotors and the passenger.\nHe doesn\'t even look as though he\'s got a seat.""\n\nGuÃ©mama came hurrying up, his eyes wide beneath his teguelmoust. ""El\nHassan! A witchman ... come out of the sky!""\n\nHomer said evenly, ""It is nothing. Only post men ready to obey my\ncommands.""\n\nGuÃ©mama hesitated as though to waver out another protest, but then\nspun and hurried off--military-like, glad to have an order to obey to\nkeep his mind from the impossible.\n\n""I\'m beginning to have a sneaking suspicion--"" Crawford began without\nfinishing. ""Come on Isobel, Cliff. We\'re going to have to make the\nmost of this.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRex Donaldson, ex-field man for the African Department of the British\nCommonwealth, dropped the lift lever of his heliohopper and settled to\nthe ground immediately before Homer Crawford who stood there flanked\nby Isobel Cunningham and Cliff Jackson. Further back and in the form\nof a crescent were possibly two or three hundred Tuareg of all ages\nand both sexes.\n\nDonaldson, in the garb of a Dogan juju man consisting of little more\nthan a wisp of cloth about his loins, played it straight, not knowing\nthe setup. On the face of it, he had just flown out of the sky\n_personally_. The size of his equipment so small as to be all but\nmeaningless.\n\nHe unstrapped himself from the thin, bicyclelike seat, and,\nexpressionlessly, folded the rotors of his tiny craft back over\nthemselves and the engine, collapsed the whole thing into a manageable\npacket of some seventy-five pounds, the seat now becoming a handle,\nand then turned and faced Crawford.\n\nDonaldson screwed his wizened face into an expression of respect and\nmade a motion of obeisance. Then he waited.\n\nIsobel said, ""El Hassan bids you speak.""\n\nThat was the tip-off, then. Crawford had already revealed himself to\nthese people as El Hassan. Very well.\n\nDonaldson spoke in Arabic, not knowing the Tamaheq tongue. ""Aselamu,\nAleikum, El Hassan. I come to obey your wishes.""\n\nA sigh had gone through the Tuareg. ""Aiiiii."" _Wallahi, even the\ndjinn obeyed El Hassan!_\n\nWith dignity, Homer Crawford said, ""Keif halak, all in my house is\nyours.""\n\nRex Donaldson inclined his small bent body again, in respect.\n\nCrawford said in English, ""Let\'s not carry this _too_ far. Come on\ninto the tent.""\n\nIgnoring the Tuareg, who still gaped but held their distance, the four\nEnglish-speaking Negroes headed for the larger of the two tents that\nhad been set up for El Hassan.\n\nAs they passed GuÃ©mama who stood slightly aside from the other Tuareg\nwith his uncle Melchizedek, the Amenokal, Crawford nodded and said,\nspeaking to them both. ""A messenger from my people to the south.\nContinue with your newly arrived warriors, O GuÃ©mama.""\n\nCliff Jackson had picked up the folded heliohopper and was now\ncarrying it easily.\n\nGuÃ©mama looked at the device and blinked.\n\nCrawford refrained from laughing at his commander of irregulars. ""It\nis not a _kambu_ device. My people deal not in magic. It is but one of\nthe many of the things the new ways bring. One day, GuÃ©mama,"" Homer\'s\nface remained expressionless, ""perhaps you will fly thus.""\n\nThe teguelmoust hid the other\'s blanch.\n\nIn the tent, Homer turned to the Bahaman, motioned to what seating\narrangements were available.\n\nIsobel said, ""I\'ll get some coffee.""\n\nCliff blurted, ""Holy Mackerel, if Donaldson, here, can drop in on us\nout of a clear sky, what keeps anybody else from doing it? Somebody\nwith a couple of neopalm bombs in the way of calling cards.""\n\nThe dried up little man grimaced in his equivalent of a grin and said,\n""Hold it, you chaps. I want to notify the others.""\n\n""The others? What others?"" Crawford said.\n\nDonaldson ignored him for a moment, unslung the small bag he carried\nover one shoulder and dipped into it for a tiny, two-way radio. He\npressed the buzzer button, then held it up to his mouth. ""Jack, Jimmy,\nDave. Here we are. Took donkey\'s years, but I found them. You chaps\nzero-in here."" He left the device on and set it to one side, then\nyawned and settled himself to the rug-covered ground, crosslegged,\nDogon style.\n\nHomer Crawford, even as he sat down himself on a footlocker, in lieu\nof a chair, rapped, ""How did you find us? Who did you just radio?\nWhere\'d you come from?""\n\n""I say, hold it,"" Donaldson chuckled sourly. ""First of all, I\'ve come\nto join up. I thought as far back as that time we co-operated in\nquelling the riots in Mopti that you ought to do this--proclaim\nyourself El Hassan. When I heard you\'d taken the step, I came to join\nup.""\n\n""Oh, great,"" Cliff said. ""What took you so long? We hardly get here,\nto our ultra-secret hideout, than here you are.""\n\nIsobel came with the coffee and handed it around, silently. Then she,\ntoo, settled to the rug which covered the sand of the floor.\n\nRex Donaldson turned to Cliff and there was a wrinkle of amusement in\nthe older man\'s eyes. ""I took so long, because I needed the time to\nrecruit a few other chaps I knew would stand with us.""\n\nCrawford rapped, ""That\'s who you just radioed?""\n\n""Of course, old boy. I\'d hardly bring the opposition down on us, would\nI?""\n\n""Where are they?""\n\n""In a couple of hovercraft, similar to your own, possibly twenty\nkilometers to the southwest.""\n\n""You still haven\'t told us how you found us?""\n\nThe little man shrugged. ""After tendering my resignation to Sir\nWinton, I considered the possibilities, which narrowed down very\nquickly when I heard the Arab Legion had taken Tamanrasset.""\n\n""Why?"" Isobel said.\n\nDonaldson shot a glance at her. ""Because, my dear, unless El Hassan is\nable to retake Tamanrasset, his movement has come a cropper."" He\nturned his eyes back to Crawford, who was nervously running his hand\nthrough his hair. ""I knew you had done considerable work in this area,\nso your whereabouts became obvious seeing that Tamanrasset is in\nTuareg country. It was simply a matter of finding what Tuareg\nencampment was your base, and since your quickest manner of gathering\nsupport would be to swing the Amenokal to your banner, I headed for\nhis usual encampment this time of year.""\n\nCliff looked at Homer Crawford. ""If Rex found us so easily, so will\nanybody else.""\n\nIsobel put in. ""Not necessarily. Mr. Donaldson has information that\nmost of El Hassan\'s opponents wouldn\'t.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer came to his feet unhappily and began pacing. ""No, Isobel.\nOstrander, for instance, has all the dope Rex has and is just as\ncapable of working it through to a conclusion. It takes no great\ninsight to realize El Hassan has to either put up or shut up when it\ncomes to Tamanrasset. That\'s possibly why some of the other elements\ninterested in North Africa have so far refrained from action against\nthe Arab Union. They want to see what El Hassan is going to do--find\nout just what he has on the ball.""\n\nRex Donaldson looked at him interestedly, ""And? What are your plans?""\n\nHomer Crawford\'s face worked. ""My plans right at present are to stay\nalive, and you finding me so easily isn\'t heartening. However, it\nbrings to mind some other problems which need solving, too.""\n\nThe rest of them fell silent, looking at him. His usual casual humor\nhad dropped away, and his personality gripped them.\n\nHe stopped his pacing, and frowned down at them.\n\n""El Hassan is going to have to remain on the move. Always. There can\nbe no capital city, no definite base, and it\'s going to be a poor idea\nto sleep twice in the same place."" He shook his head emphatically as\nthough to deny rebuttal, which they hadn\'t actually made. ""El Hassan\'s\nenemies mustn\'t know his location within twenty miles.""\n\n""Twenty miles!"" Cliff blurted.\n\nCrawford stared at him, but unseeingly. ""Yes. At least half a dozen of\nour opponents possess nuclear weapons.""\n\nDonaldson demured, sourly. ""A nuclear weapon hasn\'t been exploded for\ndonkey\'s years and--""\n\n""Of course not,"" Homer snapped. ""Nor would anyone dare, anywhere else\nexcept in the wastes of the Sahara. A nuclear explosion in the Ahaggar\nwould not go undetected and a controversy might go up in the Reunited\nNations. But who could prove who had done it? And who, actually, would\ncare if in the explosion a common foe of all was eliminated? But let\nthe Arab Union, or possibly the Soviet Complex, or even others, learn\ndefinitely where El Hassan is and a bomb could well devastate twenty\nsquare miles seeking him out."" Crawford shook his head. ""No, we\'ve\nsimply got to keep on the move.""\n\nDonaldson said, even as he nodded agreement, ""And what other problems\nwere you talking about?""\n\n""Oh?"" Homer said. ""Well, keeping on the move will serve to add mystery\nto the El Hassan legend. It isn\'t good for this Tuareg encampment,\nfor instance, to see too much of El Hassan. A leader claiming\ndomination of half a continent looks small potatoes in a desert camp\nof a few score tents. On the move, showing up here, there, the other\nplace, for only a day or two at a time, is another proposition.""\n\nHe thought a moment. ""Remember DeGaulle?""\n\n""How could we forget?"" Rex Donaldson said wryly.\n\n""He had one angle that couldn\'t be more correct. He said a leader had\nto keep remote, ever mysterious. He can\'t afford to have real\nintimates. Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin. None of them had a real friend to\ntheir name. The nearest to friends that Adolph the Aryan ever had, his\nold comrades of the beerhall days, such as Rhoem, he butchered in the\nblood purge. And Stalin? He managed to do away with every Old\nBolshevik he knew in the days before the Party came to power.""\n\nCliff was staring at him. ""Hey,"" he said. ""The one other thing one of\nthese mystical leader types needs is a belief in his own destiny. To\nthe point of clobbering all his intimates if he thinks they stand in\nhis way.""\n\nHomer broke into a sudden short laugh. ""Any qualms, Cliff?""\n\nCliff growled, ""I don\'t know. This dream of yours is growing. Where it\nmight end--I don\'t know.""\n\nAs they were talking the cries of _Ul-Ul-Ul-Allah Akbar!_ had broken\nout again.\n\n""Heavens to Betsy,"" Isobel said. ""Another contingent of camelmen?""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut this time the newcomers were three in number and rode in air\ncushion hover-lorries, the twins of that used by Homer Crawford.\n\nRex Donaldson brought them up to the tent, saying, ""I didn\'t think you\nchaps were quite so close.""\n\nHomer, Cliff and Isobel faced the new recruits. The three were dressed\nin khaki bushshirts, shorts and heavy walking shoes--British style.\nTwo were so obviously relatives that they could have been twins except\nfor an age discrepancy of two or three years. They were smaller in\nstature than the Americans present, almost chunky, but their faces\nheld education and cultivation. The third was slight of build, almost\nas wiry as Rex Donaldson, and seemed ever at ease.\n\nThe small, bent Bahaman made introductions. ""Gentlemen, let me present\nEl Hassan--Homer Crawford to you--formerly of the Reunited Nations\nAfrican Development Project, formerly of the United States of the\nAmericas."" His face twisted in his sour grimace of a grin. ""Now\nrunning for the office of tyrant of North Africa.""\n\n""And these are two of his original and most trusted adherents, Isobel\nCunningham and Cliff Jackson."" Donaldson turned to the newcomers.\n""John and James Peters--that\'s Jack and Jimmy, of course--recently\ncolleagues of mine with the African Department of the Commonwealth,\nworking largely in the Nigeria area.""\n\nHomer shook hands, grinning. ""You\'re a long way from home.""\n\n""Farther than that,"" the one labeled Jack said without a smile\nchanging the seriousness of his face. ""We\'re originally from\nTrinidad.""\n\nDonaldson said, ""And this is David Moroka, late of South Africa.""\n\nThe wiry South African said easily, ""Not so very late. In fact, I\nhaven\'t seen Jo-burg since I was a boy.""\n\nHe was shaking hands with Isobel now. ""Jo-burg?"" she said.\n\n""Johannesburg,"" he translated. ""I got out by the skin of my teeth\nduring the troubles in the 1950s.""\n\n""You sound like an American,"" Cliff said when it was his turn to\nshake.\n\n""Educated in the States,"" Moroka said. ""Best thing that ever happened\nto me was to be kicked out of the land of my birth.""\n\nHomer made a sweeping gesture at the floor and the few articles of\nfurniture the tent contained that could be improvised as chairs. ""I\'m\nsurprised you\'re up here instead of in your own neck of the woods,"" he\nsaid to the South African.\n\nMoroka shrugged. ""I was considering heading south when I ran into\nJimmy and Jack, here. They\'d already got the word on the El Hassan\nmovement from Rex. Their arguments made sense to me.""\n\nEyes went to the brothers from Trinidad and Jack Peters took over the\nposition of spokesman. He said, seriously, as though trying to\nconvince the others, ""North Africa is the starting point, the\nbeginning. Given El Hassan\'s success in uniting North Africa, the\ncentral areas and later even the south will fall into line. Perhaps\none day there will be a union of _all_ Africa.""\n\n""Or at least a strong confederation,"" Jimmy Peters added.\n\nHomer nodded thoughtfully. ""Perhaps. But we can\'t look that far\nforward now."" He looked from one of the newcomers to the other. ""I\ndon\'t know to what extent you fellows understand what the rest of us\nhave set out to accomplish but I suppose if you\'ve been with Rex for\nthe past week, you have a fairly clear idea.""\n\n""I believe so,"" Jack nodded, straight-faced.\n\nHomer Crawford said slowly, ""I don\'t want to give you the wrong idea.\nIf you join up, you\'ll find it\'s no parade. Our chances were slim to\nbegin, and we\'ve had some setbacks. As you\'ve probably heard, the Arab\nUnion has stolen a march on us. And from what we can get on the radio,\nwe have thus far to pick up a single adherent among the world powers.""\n\n""_Powers?_"" Cliff snorted. ""We haven\'t got a nation the size of Monaco\non our side.""\n\nMoroka shot a quick glance at the big Californian.\n\nIsobel caught it and laughed. ""Cliff\'s a perpetual sourpuss,"" she\nsaid. ""However, he\'s been in since the first.""\n\nThe South African looked at her in turn. ""We were hardly prepared to\nfind a beautiful American girl in the Great Erg,"" he said.\n\nSomething about his voice caused her to flush. ""We\'ve all caught\nHomer\'s dream,"" she said, almost defensively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid Moroka flung to his feet, viper fast, and dashed toward Homer\nCrawford, his hands extended.\n\nAutomatically, Cliff Jackson stuck forward a foot in an attempt to\ntrip him--and missed.\n\nThe South African, moving with blurring speed, grasped the\nunsuspecting Crawford by the right hand and arm, swung with fantastic\nspeed and sent the American sprawling to the far side of the tent.\n\nHomer Crawford, old in rough and tumble, was already rolling out.\nBefore the inertia of his fall had given way, his right hand, only a\nsplit second before in the grip of the other, was fumbling for the 9\nmm Noiseless holstered at his belt.\n\nRex Donaldson, a small handgun magically in his hand, was standing,\nhalf crouched on his thin, bent legs. The two brothers from Trinidad\nhadn\'t moved, their eyes bugging.\n\nMoroka was spinning with the momentum of the sudden attack he\'d made\non his new chief. Now there was a gun in his own hand and he was\ndarting for the tent opening.\n\nCliff yelled indignantly, ""Stop him!""\n\nIsobel, on her feet by now, both hands to her mouth, was staring at\nthe goatskin tent covering, against which, a moment earlier, Crawford\nhad been gently leaning his back as he talked.\n\nThere was a vicious slash in the leather and even as she pointed, the\nrazor-sharp arm dagger\'s blade disappeared. There was the sound of\nrunning feet outside the tent.\n\nHomer Crawford had assimilated the situation before the rest. He, too,\nwas darting for the tent entrance, only feet behind Moroka.\n\nDonaldson followed, muttering bitterly under his breath, his face\ntwisted more as though in distaste than in fighting anger.\n\nCliff, too, finally saw light and dashed after the others, leaving\nonly Isobel and the Peters brothers. They heard the muffled coughing\nof a silenced gun, twice, thrice and then half a dozen times, blurting\ntogether in automatic fire.\n\nHomer Crawford shuffled through the sand on an awkward run, rounding\nthe tent, weapon in hand.\n\nThere was a native on the ground making final spasmatic muscular\nmovements in his death throes, and not more than three feet from him,\ncoolly, David Moroka sat, bracing his elbows on his knees and aiming,\ntwo-handed, as his gun emptied itself.\n\nCrawford brought his own gun up, seeking the target, and clipping at\nthe same time, ""We want him alive--""\n\nIt was too late. Two hundred feet beyond, a running tribesman, long\narm dagger still in hand, stumbled, ran another three or four feet\nwith hesitant steps, and then collapsed.\n\nMoroka said, ""Too late, Crawford. He would have got away."" The South\nAfrican started to his feet, brushing sand from his khaki bush\nshorts.\n\nThe others were beginning to come up and from the Tuareg encampment a\nrush of GuÃ©mama\'s men started in their direction.\n\nCrawford said unhappily, looking down at the dead native at their\nfeet, ""I hate to see unnecessary killing.""\n\nMoroka looked at him questioningly. ""Unnecessary? Another split second\nand his knife would have been in your gizzard. What do you want to\ngive him, another chance?""\n\nCrawford said uncomfortably, ""Thanks, Dave, anyway. That was quick\nthinking.""\n\n""Thank God,"" Donaldson said, coming up, his wrinkled face scowling\nunhappily, first at the dead man at their feet, and then at the one\nalmost a hundred yards away. ""Are these local men? Where were your\nbodyguards?""\n\nCliff Jackson skidded to a halt, after rounding the tent. He\'d heard\nonly the last words. ""What bodyguards?"" he said.\n\nMoroka looked at Crawford accusingly. ""El Hassan,"" he said. ""Leader of\nall North Africa. And you haven\'t even got around to bodyguards? Do\nyou fellows think you\'re playing children\'s games? Gentlemen, I assure\nyou, the chips are down.""\n\n\nVI\n\nEl Hassan\'s Tuaregs were on the move. After half a century and more of\nrelative peace the Apaches of the Sahara, the Sons of Shaitan and the\nForgotten of Allah were again disappearing into the ergs to emerge\nhere, there, and ghostlike to disappear again. They faded in and faded\naway again, and even in their absence dominated all.\n\nEl Hassan was on the move, as all men by now knew, and he, who was not\nfor the amalgamation of all North Africa, was judged against him. And\nwho, in the Sahara, could afford to be against El Hassan when his\nTuaregs were everywhere?\n\nRefugees poured into Tamanrasset for the security of Arab Legion arms,\nor into In Salah and Reggan to the north, or Agades and Zinder to the\nsouth. Refugees who had already taken their stand with the Arab Union\nand Pan-Islam. Refugees who were men of property and would know more\nof this El Hassan before risking their wealth. Refugees who took no\nstand, but dreaded those who drank the milk of war, no matter the\ncause for which they fought. Refugees who fled simply because others\nfled, for terror is a most contagious disease.\n\nColonel Midan Ibrahim of the crack motorized units of the Arab Legion\nwhich occupied Tamanrasset, was fuming. His task was a double one.\nFirst, to hold Tamanrasset and its former French stronghold Fort\nLaperrine; second, to keep open his lines of communication with\nGhademÃ¨s and Ghat, in Arab Union dominated Libya. To hold them until\nfurther steps were decided upon by his superiors in Cairo and the\nNear East--whatever these steps might be. Colonel Midan Ibrahim was\ntoo low in the Arab Union hierarchy to be in on such privy matters.\n\nHis original efforts, in pushing across the Sahara from GhademÃ¨s and\nGhat, had been no more than desert maneuvers. There had been no force\nother than nature\'s to say him nay. The Reunited Nations was an\norganization composed possibly of great powers, but in supposedly\nacting in unison they became a shrieking set of hair-tearing women;\nthe whole being less than any of its individual parts. And El Hassan?\nNo more than a rumor. In fact, an asset because this supposed mystery\nman of the desert, bent on uniting all North Africa under his\ndomination, gave the Arab Union, its alibi for stepping in with\nColonel Ibrahim\'s men.\n\nYes, the original efforts had been but a drill. But now his Arab\nLegion troopers were beginning to face reality. The supply trucks,\ncoming down under convoy from GhademÃ¨s, reported the water source at\nOhanet destroyed. The major well would take a week or more to repair.\nWho had committed the sabotage? Some said the Tuareg, some said local\nfollowers of El Hassan, others, desert tribesmen resentful of _both_\nthe Arab Union and El Hassan.\n\nOne of his routine patrols, feeling out toward Meniet to the north,\nhad suddenly dropped radio communication, almost in mid-sentence. A\nrelieving patrol had thus far found nothing, the armored car\'s tracks\ncovered over by the sands.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd rumors, rumors, rumors, Colonel Midan Ibrahim, born of\naristocratic Alexandrian blood, though trained to a sharp edge in Near\nEastern warfare, was basically city bred. The gloss of desert training\nmight take on him, but the bedouin life itself was not in his\nexperience, and it was hard for him to trace the dividing line between\npossibility and fantasy.\n\nRumors, rumors, rumors. They seemed capable of sweeping from one end\nof the Sahara to the other in a matter of hours. Faster, it would seem\nthan the information could be dispensed by radio. El Hassan was here.\nEl Hassan was there. El Hassan was marching on Rabat, in Morocco; El\nHassan had just signed a treaty with the Soviet Complex; El Hassan had\nbeen assassinated by a disgruntled follower. Or El Hassan was a\nrenegade Christian; El Hassan was a Moslem of Sheriffian blood, a\ndirect descendant of the Prophet; El Hassan was a pagan come up from\nDahomey and practiced ritual cannibalism; El Hassan was a Jew, a\nveteran of the Israel debacle.\n\nBut this Colonel Ibrahim knew--the Tuareg had gone over to the new\nmovement en masse. Something there was in El Hassan and his dream that\nhad appealed to the Forgotten of Allah. The Tuareg, for the first time\nsince the French Camel Corps had broken their strength, were\nunited--united and on the move.\n\nThe Tuareg were everywhere. In most sinister fashion--everywhere. And\nall were El Hassan\'s men.\n\nColonel Ibrahim fumed and wondered what kept his superiors from\nsending in additional columns, additional armored elements. And, above\nall, adequate air cover. Ha! Give the colonel sufficient aircraft and\nhe\'d begin snuffing out bedouin life like candles--and bring the Peace\nof Allah to the Ahaggar.\n\nSo Colonel Ibrahim fumed, demanded further orders from mum superiors,\nand put his legionnaires to work on bigger and better gun\nemplacements, trenches and pillboxes surrounding Fort Laperinne and\nTamanrasset.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEl Hassan\'s personal entourage numbered exactly twenty persons. Of\nthese, five were his immediate English-speaking, Western-educated\nsupporters, Cliff, Isobel and the new Jack and Jimmy Peters and Dave\nMoroka. Rex Donaldson had been sent south again to operate in Senegal\nand Mali, to take over direction of the rapidly spreading movement in\nsuch centers as Bamako and Mopti and later, if possible, in Dakar.\n\nThe other fifteen were carefully selected Tuareg, picked from among\nGuÃ©mama\'s tribesmen taking care to show no preference to any tribe or\nclan, and taking particular care to choose men who fought coolly,\nunexcitedly, and didn\'t froth at the mouth when in action; men who\nwere slow to charge wildly into the enemy\'s guns--but slower still to\nretreat when the going was hot. El Hassan was prone to neither hero\nnor coward in his personal bodyguard.\n\nThey kept under movement. In Abelessa one day, almost in range of the\nmobile artillery of the Arab Legion; in Timassao the next, checking\nthe wells that meant everything to a desert force; the following day\nas far south as the Tamesna region to rally the less warlike\nIrreguenaten, a half-breed Tuareg people largely held in scorn by\nthose of the Ahaggar.\n\nHomer Crawford was killing time whilst stirring up as much noise and\ndust as his handful of followers could manage. Killing time until\nElmer Allen from the Chaambra country, Bey-ag-Akhamouk from the Teda,\nand Kenny Ballalou from the west could show up with their columns. He\nhad no illusions of how things now stood. At best, he could hold\ntogether a thousand Tuareg fighting men. No more. The economics of\ndesert life prevented him a larger force, unless he had the resources\nof the modern world at hand, and he didn\'t. Besides that, the Tuareg\nconfederation could provide no larger number of fighting men and at\nthe same time continue their desert economy.\n\nHe stood now with Isobel, Cliff and Dave Moroka in one of the western\ntype tents which the Peters brothers had brought with them in their\nhover-lorries, and poured over the half-adequate maps which covered\nthe area.\n\nDave Moroka traced with a finger. ""If we could dominate these wells\nrunning to Djanet, our Arab Union friends would have only their one\nline of supply going through Temassinine to GhademÃ¨s. That\'s a long\nhaul, Homer.""\n\nHomer Crawford scowled thoughtfully. ""That involves only four wells.\nIf Ibrahim\'s legionnaires staked out only three armored vehicles at\neach water hole, they could hold them. Our camelmen could never take\narmor.""\n\nMoroka frowned, too. ""We\'ve got to start _some_ sort of action, or the\nmen will start dribbling away.""\n\nCliff Jackson said, ""Bey and Kenny and Elmer should be coming soon. I\nheard a radio item this morning about a big pro-El Hassan movement\nstarting in the Sudan among the Teda.""\n\nMoroka said, ""We need some sort of quick, spectacular victory. The\nbedouin can lose interest as quickly as they can get steamed up, and\nthus far we haven\'t given them anything but words--promises.""\n\n""You\'re right,"" Homer growled, ""but there\'s nothing we can do right\nnow but mark time. Irritate the Arabs a bit. Keep them from spreading\nout.""\n\nIsobel brought coffee, handing around the small Moroccan cups. She\nsaid, ""Well, one thing is certain. We get supplies soon or start\neating jerked goat and camel milk curds.""\n\nMoroka said in irritation, ""It\'s not funny.""\n\nIsobel raised her eyebrows. ""I didn\'t mean it to be. Have you ever\nbeen on a camel curd diet?""\n\n""Yes, I have,"" Moroka said impatiently. He turned back to Homer\nCrawford. ""How about waylaying an armored car or so, just in the way\nof giving the men something exciting to do?""\n\nCrawford ran a hand back through his short hair. ""Confound it, Dave,\ncan you picture what a Recoilless-Brenn gun would do to a harka of our\ncharging camelmen? We can\'t let these people be butchered.""\n\n""I wasn\'t thinking of wild charges,"" Moroka argued.\n\nThey had both turned away from Isobel, in their discussion. Now she\nlooked at them, strangely. And especially at Homer Crawford. His\nbrusqueness toward her didn\'t seem the old Homer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a bustle from outside and a guardsman stuck his head in the\ntent entrance and reported in Tamaheq that a small camel patrol\napproached.\n\nThe four of them went out. Coming up were a dozen Tuareg and two motor\nvehicles.\n\nCliff said, ""Something new.""\n\nMoroka said, ""We can use the transport.""\n\n""Let\'s see who they are, before we start requisitioning their\nproperty,"" Homer said dryly.\n\nThe two desert trucks had hardly come to a halt before the camouflaged\ntents and hover-lorries of El Hassan\'s small encampment before a\nheavy-set, gray haired Negro, whose energy belied his weight, bounced\ndown from the seat adjacent to the driver\'s in the lead vehicle and\nstomped belligerently to the group before the tent.\n\n""What is the meaning of this?"" he snapped.\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him. ""I\'m sure I don\'t know as yet, Dr.\nSmythe. Neither you nor these followers of mine have informed me as to\nwhat has transpired. Won\'t you enter my quarters here and we\'ll go\ninto it under more comfortable conditions?"" He glanced upward at the\nmidday Saharan sun.\n\nThe other seemed taken aback at Crawford calling him by name. He\nsquinted at the man who was seemingly his captor.\n\n""Crawford!"" he snapped. ""Dr. Homer Crawford! See here, what is the\nmeaning of this?""\n\nHomer said, ""Dr. Warren Harding Smythe, may I present Isobel\nCunningham, Clifford Jackson and David Moroka, of my staff?""\n\n""Huuump. I met Miss Cunningham and, I believe, Mr. Jackson at that\nridiculous meeting in Timbuktu, a short time ago."" The doctor peered\nover his glasses at Moroka.\n\nThe wiry South African nodded his head. ""A pleasure, Doctor."" He held\nopen the tent entrance.\n\nSmythe snorted again and stomped inside to escape the sun\'s glare.\n\nIn the shade of the tent\'s interior, Isobel clucked at him and hurried\nto get a drink of water from a moist water cooler. Homer Crawford\nmotioned the other to a seat, and took one himself. ""Now then, Dr.\nSmythe.""\n\nThe indignant medic blurted, ""Those confounded bandits out there--""\n\n""Irregular camel cavalry,"" Crawford amended gently.\n\n""They\'ve kidnapped me and my staff. I demand that you intercede, if\nyou have any influence with them.""\n\n""What were you doing?"" Crawford was frowning at the other. Actually,\nhe had no idea of the circumstances under which the probably\noverenthusiastic Tuareg troopers had rounded up the American medical\nman.\n\n""Doing? You know perfectly well I represent the American Medical\nRelief. My team has been in the vicinity of Silet, working with the\nnomads. The country is rife with everything from rickets to syphilis!\nEighty per cent of these people suffer from trachoma. My team--""\n\n""Just a moment,"" Moroka said. ""You mean out in those two trucks you\nhave a complete American medical setup? Assistants and all?""\n\nSmythe said stiffly, ""I have two American nurses with me and four\nAlgerians recruited in Oran. This sort of interference with my work is\ninsufferable and--""\n\nThe South African was staring at Homer Crawford.\n\nCliff Jackson cleared his throat. ""It seems as though El Hassan has\njust acquired a Department of Health.""\n\n""El Hassan?"" Smythe stuttered. ""What, what?""\n\nIsobel said softly, ""Dr. Smythe, surely you have heard of El Hassan.""\n\n""Heard of him? I\'ve heard of nothing else for the past month!\nConfounded ignorant barbarian. What this part of the world needs is\n_less_ intertribal, interracial, international fighting, not more. The\nman\'s a raving lunatic and--""\n\nIsobel said gently, ""Doctor ... may I introduce you to El Hassan?""\n\n""What ... what--?"" For the briefest of moments, there was an element\nof timorness in the sputtering doctor\'s voice. Then suddenly he\ncomprehended.\n\nHe pointed at Homer Crawford accusingly. ""You\'re El Hassan!""\n\nHomer nodded, seriously, ""That\'s correct, Doctor.""\n\nThe doctor\'s eyes went around the four of them. ""You\'ve done what you\nwere driving at there at that meeting in Timbuktu. You\'re trying to\nunite these people in spite of themselves and then drag them,\nwilly-nilly, into the twentieth century.""\n\nHomer still nodded.\n\nSmythe shook an indignant finger at him. ""I told you then, Crawford,\nand I tell you now. These natives are not suited for such sudden\nchange. Already they are subject to mass neurosis because they cannot\nadjust to a world that changes too quickly.""\n\n""I wonder if that doesn\'t apply to the rest of us as well,"" Cliff said\nunhappily. ""But the changes go on, if we like them or not. Can you\nthink of any way to turn them off?""\n\nThe doctor snorted.\n\nHomer Crawford said, ""Dr. Smythe, the die is already cast. The\nquestion now becomes, will you join us?""\n\n""Join you! Certainly not!""\n\nCrawford said evenly, ""Then I might suggest that, first, you will not\nbe allowed to operate in my territory."" He considered for a moment,\ngrinning inwardly, but on the surface his expression serene. He added,\n""And second, that you will probably have difficulties procuring an\nexit visa from my domains.""\n\n""Exit visa! Are you jesting? See here, my good man, you realize I am a\ncitizen of the United States of the Americas and--""\n\n""A country,"" Homer yawned, ""with which I have not as yet opened\ndiplomatic relations, and hence has little representation in North\nAfrica.""\n\nThe doctor was bug-eying him. He began sputtering again. ""This isn\'t\nfunny. You\'re an American citizen yourself. And you, Miss Cunningham\nand--""\n\nIsobel said sadly, ""As a matter of fact, the last we heard, the State\nDepartment representative told us our passports were invalid.""\n\nCrawford leaned forward. ""Look here, Doctor. You don\'t see eye to eye\nwith us on matters socio-economic. However, as a medical man, I submit\nthat joining my group ... ah, that is, until you can secure an exit\nvisa from my authorities ... will give you an excellent opportunity to\npractice your science here in the Sahara under the wing of El Hassan.\nI\'ll assign a place for your trucks and tents. Please consider the\nquestion and let me have your answer at your leisure. Meanwhile, we\nwill prepare a desert feast suitable to the high esteem in which we\nhold you.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey looked after the doctor, as he left, and Moroka chuckled.\nHowever, Isobel was watching Homer Crawford quizzically.\n\nShe said finally, ""We rode over him a little in the roughshod manner,\ndidn\'t we?""\n\nHomer Crawford growled uncomfortably, ""Particularly when we finally\nhave our showdown with the Arab Legion, a medic will be priceless.""\n\nIsobel said softly, ""And the end justifies the means--""\n\nHomer shot a quick, impatient look at her. ""The good doctor and his\npeople are in the Sahara to work with the Tuareg and the Teda and the\nrest of the bedouin. Beyond that, he has the same dream we have--of\ndeveloping this continent of our racial background.""\n\n""But he doesn\'t believe in your methods, Homer, and we\'re forcing him\nto follow El Hassan\'s road in spite of his beliefs.""\n\nMoroka had been peering at the two of them narrowly. ""You don\'t make\nomelets without breaking eggs,"" he said, his voice on the overbearing\nside.\n\nShe spun on him. ""But the omelets don\'t turn out so well if some of\nthe eggs you use are rotten.""\n\nThe South African\'s voice turned gentle. ""Miss Cunningham,"" he said,\n""working in the field, like this, can have its rugged side for a young\nand delicate woman--""\n\n""_Delicate!_"" she snapped. ""I\'ll have you know--""\n\n""Hey, everybody, hold it,"" Cliff injected. ""What goes on?""\n\nDave Moroka shrugged. ""It just seems to me that Isobel might do better\nback in Dakar, or in New York with your friend Jake Armstrong.\nSomewhere where her sensibilities wouldn\'t be so bruised, and where\nher assets""--his eyes went up and down her lithe body--""could be put\nto better use.""\n\nIsobel\'s sepia face had gone a shade or more lighter. She said, very\nflatly, ""My assets, Mr. Moroka, are in my head.""\n\nHomer Crawford said disgustedly, ""O.K., O.K., let\'s all knock it off.""\n\nHis eyes flicked back and forth between them, in definite command. ""I\ndon\'t want to hear any more in the way of personalities between you\ntwo.""\n\nMoroka shrugged again. ""Yes, sir,"" he said without inflection.\n\nIsobel turned away and took up some paperwork, without further words.\nShe suppressed her feeling of seething indignation.\n\nHomer Crawford, under his pressures, was changing. Possibly, she had\ntold herself before, it was change for the better. The need was for a\n_strong_ man, perhaps even a ruthless one.\n\nThe Homer Crawford she had first known was an easier going man than\nhe who had snapped an abrupt order to her a moment ago. The Homer she\nhad first known requested things of his teammates and friends. El\nHassan had learned to command.\n\nThe Homer she had first known could never have ridden, roughshod, over\nthe basically gentle Dr. Smythe.\n\nThe Homer she had first known, when the El Hassan scheme was still\naborning, had thought of himself as a member of a team. He was quick\nto ask advice of all, and quick to take it if it had validity. Now\nHomer, as El Hassan, was depending less and less upon the opinions of\nthose surrounding him, more and more upon his own decisions which he\nseemed to sometimes reach purely through intuition.\n\nThe El Hassan dream was still upon her, but, womanlike, she wondered\nif she liked the would-be tyrant of all North Africa as well as she\nhad once liked the easy-going American idealist, Homer Crawford.\n\nJack and Jimmy Peters, the brothers from Trinidad, entered, the former\ncarrying a couple of books.\n\nThey\'d evidently failed to note the raised voices and wore their\ncustomary serious expressions. Jack looked at Homer and said, ""_Cu vi\nscias Esperanton?_""\n\nHomer Crawford\'s eyebrows went up but he said, ""_Jes, mi parolas\nEsperanto tre bona, mi pensas._""\n\n""_Bona_,"" Jack said, ""_Tre bona_.""\n\n""_Jes, estas bele_,"" his brother said.\n\nMoroka was scowling back and forth from one of them to the other. ""I\nthought I had a fairly good working knowledge of the world\'s more\ncommon languages,"" he said, ""but that goes by me. It sounds like a\ncross between Italian and pig-Latin.""\n\nHomer said to the Peters brothers, ""Let\'s drop Esperanto so that Dave,\nIsobel and Cliff can follow us. We can give it a whirl later, if you\'d\nlike, just for the practice.""\n\nIsobel said slowly, ""_Mi parolas Esperanto, malgranda_."" Then in\nEnglish, ""I took it for kicks while I was still in school. Kind of\nrusty now, though.""\n\n""Esperanto?"" Cliff said. ""You mean that gobblydygook so-called\ninternational language?""\n\nJack Peters looked at him, serious faced as always. ""What is wrong\nwith an international language, Mr. Jackson?""\n\nCliff was taken aback. ""Search me. But it doesn\'t seem to have proved\nvery practical. It didn\'t catch on.""\n\n""Well, more than you might think,"" Isobel told him. ""There are\nprobably hundreds of thousands of persons in one part of the world or\nanother who can get along in Esperanto.""\n\nMoroka said impatiently, ""What\'re a few hundred thousands of people in\na world population like ours? Cliff\'s right. It never took hold.""\n\nHomer said, ""All right, Jack and Jimmy. You boys evidently have\nsomething on your minds. Let everybody sit down and listen to it.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven before they got thoroughly settled, Jack Peters was launching\ninto his pitch.\n\n""We need an official language,"" he said. ""The El Hassan movement has\nset as a goal the uniting of all North Africa. We might start here in\nthe Sahara, but it\'s just a start. Ultimately, the idea is to reach\nfrom Morocco to Egypt and from the Mediterranean to ... to where? The\nCongo?""\n\n""Actually, we\'ve never set exact limits,"" Homer said.\n\n""Ultimately _all Africa_,"" Dave Moroka muttered softly. He ignored the\nmanner in which Isobel contemplated him from the side of her eyes.\n\n""All right,"" the West Indian said. ""There are more than seven hundred\nmajor languages, not counting dialects, in Africa. Sooner or later, we\nneed an official language, what is it going to be?""\n\n""Why _one_ official language? Why not several?"" Cliff scowled. ""Say\nArabic, here in this area. Swahili on the East coast. And, say,\nSonghoi along the Niger, and Wolof, the Senegalese lingua franca,\nand--""\n\n""You see,"" Peters interrupted. ""Already you have half a dozen and you\nhaven\'t even got out of this immediate vicinity as yet. Let me develop\nmy point.""\n\nHomer Crawford was becoming interested. ""Go on, Jack,"" he said.\n\nJack Peters pointed a finger at him. ""To be the hero-symbol we have in\nmind, El Hassan is going to have to be able to communicate with _all_\nof his people. He\'s not going to be able to speak Arabic to, say, a\nMasai in Kenya. They hate the Arabs. He\'s not going to be able to\nspeak Swahili to a Moroccan, they\'ve never heard of the language. He\ncan\'t speak Tamaheq to the Imraguen, they\'re scared to death of the\nTuareg.""\n\nHomer said thoughtfully, ""A common language would be fine. It\'d solve\na lot of problems. But it doesn\'t seem to be in the cards. Why not\nadopt as our official language the one in which the _most_ of our\npeople will be able to communicate? Say, Arabic?""\n\nJack was shaking his head seriously. ""And antagonize all the Arab\nhating Bantu in Africa? It\'s no go, Homer.""\n\n""Well, then, say French--or English.""\n\n""English is the most international language in the world,"" Moroka\nsaid. But his face was thoughtful, as those of the others were\nbecoming.\n\nThe West Indian was beginning to make his points now. ""No, any of the\nEuropean languages are out. The white man has been repudiated.\nAdopting English, French, Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch, as our\nofficial language would antagonize whole sections of the continent.""\n\n""Why Esperanto?"" Cliff scowled. ""Why not, say, Nov-Esperanto, or Ido,\nor Interlingua?""\n\nJimmy Peters put in a word now. ""Actually, any one of them would\npossibly do, but we have a head start with Esperanto. Some years ago\nboth Jack and I became avid Esperantists, being naÃ¯ve enough in those\ndays to think an international language would ultimately solve all\nman\'s problems. And both Homer and Isobel seem to have a working\nknowledge of the language.""\n\nHomer said, ""So have the other members of my former Reunited Nations team.\nThat\'s where those books you found came from. Elmer, Bey, Kenny ... and\nAbe ... and I used to play around with it when we were out in the desert,\njust to kill time. We also used it as sort of a secret language when we\nwanted to communicate and didn\'t know if those around us might understand\nsome English.""\n\n""I still don\'t get the picture,"" Cliff argued. ""If we picked the most\ncommon half a dozen languages in the territory we cover, then millions\nof these people wouldn\'t have to study a second language. But if you\nadapt Esperanto as an official language then _everybody_ is going to\nhave to learn something new. And that\'s not going to be easy for our\nninety-five per cent illiterate followers.""\n\nIsobel said thoughtfully, ""Well, it\'s a darn sight easier to learn\nEsperanto than any other language we decided to make official.""\n\n""Why?"" Cliff said argumentatively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJack Peters took over. ""Because it\'s almost unbelievably easy to\nlearn. English, by the way, is extremely difficult. For instance,\nspelling and pronunciation are absolutely phonetic in Esperanto and\nthere are only five vowel sounds where most national languages have\ntwenty or so. And each sound in the alphabet has one sound only and\nany sound is always rendered by the same letter.""\n\nDave Moroka said, ""Actually, I don\'t know anything at all about this\nEsperanto.""\n\nThe West Indian took him in, with a dominating glance. ""Take grammar and\nsyntax which can take up volumes in other languages. Esperanto has exactly\nsixteen short rules. And take vocabularies. For instance, in English we\noften form the feminine of a noun by adding _ess--actor-actress_,\n_tiger-tigress_. But not always. We don\'t say _bull-bulless_ or\n_ghost-ghostess_. In Esperanto you simply add the feminine ending to any\nnoun--there\'s no exception to any rule.""\n\nJack Peters was caught up in his subject. ""Still comparing it to\nEnglish, realize that spelling and pronunciation in English are highly\nirregular and one letter can have several different sounds, and one\nsound may be represented by different letters. And there are even\nsilent letters which are written but not pronounced like the _ugh_ in\n_though_. There are none of these irregularities in Esperanto. And the\nsounds are all sharp with none of such subtle differences as, say,\n_bed/bad/bard/bawd_, that sort of thing.""\n\nJimmy Peters said, ""The big item is that any averagely intelligent\nperson can begin speaking Esperanto within a few hours. Within a week\nof even moderate study, say three or four hours a day, he\'s\nastonishingly fluent.""\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIsobel said thoughtfully, ""There\'d be international advantages. It\'s\nalways been a galling factor in Africans dealing with Europeans that\nthey had to learn the European language involved. You couldn\'t expect\nyour white man to learn kitchen kaffir, or Swahili, or whatever, not\nwhen you got on the diplomatic level.""\n\nCliff Jackson was thinking out loud. ""So far, El Hassan is an unknown.\nRumor has it that he\'s everything from a renegade Egyptian, to an\nescaped Mau-Mau chief, to a Senegalese sergeant formerly in the French\nWest African forces. But when he starts running into the press and\nthey find that Homer and his closest associates all speak English, and\nmost of them with an American accent, there\'s going to be some fat in\nthe fire.""\n\n""And El Hassan will have lost some of his mysterious glamour,"" Homer\nadded thoughtfully.\n\nEven Moroka, the South African, was beginning to accept the idea. ""If\nEl Hassan, himself, refused in the presence of foreigners ever to\nspeak anything but Esperanto, the aura of mystery would continue.""\n\nJimmy Peters, elaborating and obviously pushing an opinion he and his\nbrother had already discussed, said, ""We make it a rule that every\nschool, both locally taught and foreign, must teach Esperanto as a\nrequired subject. All El Hassan governmental affairs would be\nconducted in that language. Anybody at all trying to get anywhere in\nthe new regime would have to learn the official inter-African tongue.""\n\n""Oh, brother,"" Cliff groaned, ""that means me."" He brightened. ""We\nhaven\'t any books or anything, as yet.""\n\nIsobel laughed at him. ""I\'ll take on your studies, Cliff. We have a\nfew books. Those that Homer and his team used to kill time with. And\nas soon as we\'re in a position to make requests for foreign aid of the\ngreat powers, Esperanto grammars, dictionaries and so forth can be\nhigh on the list.""\n\nWith a sharp cry, almost a bark, a figure jumped into the entrance and\nwith a bound into the center of the tent, sub-machinegun in hand.\n""_All right, everybody. On your feet. The place is raided!_""\n\nDave Moroka leaped to his feet, his hand tearing with blurring speed\nfor his holstered hand gun. ""Where\'s that bodyguard?"" he yelled.\n\n\nVII\n\n""Hold it,"" Homer Crawford roared, jumping to his own feet and grabbing\nthe South African in his arms. He glared at the newcomer. ""Kenny, you\nidiot, you\'re lucky you don\'t have a couple of holes in you.""\n\nKenny Ballalou, grinning widely, stared at Dave Moroka. ""Jeepers,"" he\nsaid, ""you got that gun out fast. Don\'t you ever stick \'em up when\nsomebody has the drop on you?""\n\nDave Moroka relaxed, the side arm dropping back into its holster.\nHomer Crawford released him and the South African ran a hand over his\nmouth and shook his head ruefully at Kenny.\n\nIsobel and Cliff crowded up, the one to kiss Kenny happily, the other\nto pound him on the back.\n\nHomer made introductions to Dave Moroka and the Peters brothers.\n\n""I\'ve told you about Kenny,"" he wound it up. ""I sent him over to the\nwest to raise a harka of Nemadi to help in taking Tamanrasset."" He\njoined Cliff Jackson in giving the smaller man an affectionate blow on\nthe shoulder. ""What luck did you have, Kenny?""\n\nKenny Ballalou rubbed himself ruefully. ""If you two will stop beating,\nI\'ll tell you. I didn\'t recruit a single Nemadi.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him.\n\nKenny said to the tent at large. ""Anybody got a drink around here?\nGood grief, have I been covering ground.""\n\nIsobel bustled off to a corner where she\'d amassed most of their\nremaining European type supplies, but she kept her attention on him.\n\nDave Moroka said, his voice unbelieving, ""You mean you haven\'t brought\nany assistance _at all_?""\n\nKenny grinned around at them. ""I didn\'t say that. I said I didn\'t\nrecruit any of the Nemadi. I never even got as far as their\nterritory.""\n\nHomer Crawford sank back onto the small crate he\'d been using as a\nchair before Kenny\'s precipitate entrance. ""O.K.,"" he said, ""stop\ndramatizing and let us know what happened.""\n\nKenny spread his hands in a sweeping gesture. ""The country\'s alive\nfrom here to Bidon Cinq and south to the Niger. Bourem and Gao have\ngone over to El Hassan and a column of followers was descending on\nNiamey. They should be there by now. I never got as far as Nemadi\ncountry. I could have recruited ten thousand fighting men, but I\ndidn\'t know what we\'d do with them in this country. So I weeded\nthrough everybody who volunteered and took only veterans. Men who\'d\nformerly been in the French forces, or British, or whatever. Louis\nWallington and his team were in Bourem when I got there and--""\n\n""Who is Louis Wallington?"" Jack Peters said.\n\nHomer looked over at the Peters brothers and Dave Moroka. ""Head of a\nsix-man Sahara Development Project team like the one I used to head.""\nHis eyes went back to Kenny. ""What about Louis?""\n\n""He\'s come in with us. Didn\'t know how to get in touch, so he was\nworking on his own. And Pierre Dupaine. Remember him, the fellow from\nGuadeloupe in the French West Indies, used to be an operative of the\nAfrican Affairs sector of the French Community? Well, he and a half\ndozen of his colleagues have come in and were leading an expedition on\nTimbuktu. But Timbuktu had already joined up too, before they got\nthere--""\n\n""Wow,"" Homer said. ""It\'s really spreading.""\n\nCliff said, ""Why isn\'t all this on the radio?""\n\nIsobel had brought Kenny a couple of ounces of cognac from their\nmeager supply. He knocked it back thankfully.\n\nKenny said to Cliff, ""Things are moving too fast, and communications\nhave gone to pot."" He looked at Homer. ""Have any of these journalists\nfound you yet?""\n\n""What journalists?""\n\nKenny laughed. ""You\'ll find out. Half the newspapers, magazines,\nnewsreels and TV outfits in the world are sending every man they can\nrelease into this area. They\'re going batty trying to find El Hassan.\nMan, do you realize the extent of the country your followers now\ndominate?""\n\nHomer said blankly, ""I hadn\'t thought of it. Besides, most of what\nyou\'ve been saying is news to us here. We\'ve been keeping on the\nprod.""\n\nKenny grinned widely. ""Well, the nearest I can figure it, El Hassan is\nruler of an area about the size of Mexico. At least it was yesterday.\nBy today, you can probably tack on Texas.""\n\nJimmy Peters, serious faced as usual, said, ""Things are moving so\nfast, we\'re going to have to run to keep ahead of El Hassan\'s\nfollowers. One thing, Homer, we\'re going to have to have a press\nsecretary.""\n\n""Elmer Allen was going to handle that, but he\'s still up north,""\nIsobel said.\n\n""I\'ll do it. Used to be a newspaperman, when I was younger,"" Dave\nMoroka said quickly.\n\nIsobel frowned and began to say something, but Homer said, ""Great, you\nhandle that, Dave."" Then to Kenny, ""Where\'re your men and how well are\nthey armed?""\n\n""Well, that\'s one trouble,"" Kenny said unhappily. ""We requisitioned\nmotor transport from some of the Sahara Afforestation Project oases\ndown around Tessalit. In fact, Ralph Sandell, their chief mucky-muck\nin those parts, has come over to us. But we haven\'t got much in the\nway of shooting irons.""\n\nHomer Crawford closed his eyes wearily. ""What it boils down to, still,\nis that a hundred of those Arab Legionnaires, with their armor, could\nfinish us all off in ten minutes if it came to open battle.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEl Hassan continued moving his headquarters, usually daily, but he\neluded the journalists only another twelve hours. Then they were upon\nthe mobile camp like locusts.\n\nAnd David Moroka took over with a calm efficiency that impressed all.\nIn the first place, he explained, El Hassan was much too busy to\nhandle the press except for one conference a week. In the second\nplace, he spoke only Esperanto to foreigners. Meanwhile, he, Dave\nMoroka, would handle all their questions, make arrangements for\nsuitable photographs, and for the TV and newsreel boys to trundle\ntheir equipment as near the front lines as possible. And, meanwhile,\nJames and John Peters of El Hassan\'s staff had prepared press releases\ncovering the El Hassan movement and its program.\n\nHomer, to the extent possible, was isolated from the new elements\ndescending upon his encampment. Attempting anything else would have\nbeen out of the question. At this point, he was getting approximately\nfour hours of sleep a night.\n\nKenny Ballalou was continually coming and going in a mad attempt to\nhandle the logistics of supplying several thousand men in a desert\narea all but devoid of either water or graze, not to speak of food,\npetroleum products and ammunition.\n\nIsobel and Cliff were thrown into the positions of combination\nsecretaries, ministers of finance, assistant bodyguards, and all else\nthat nobody else seemed to handle, _including_ making coffee.\n\nIt was Isobel who approached a subject which had long worried her, as\nthey drove across country, the only occupants of one of the original\nhover-lorries, during a camp move.\n\nShe said, hesitantly, ""Homer, is it a good idea to give Dave such a\nfree hand with the press? You know, there are some fifty or so of them\naround now and they must be influencing the TV, radio, magazines and\nnewspapers of the world.""\n\n""He seems to know more about it than any of the rest of us,"" Homer\nsaid, his eyes on the all but sand-obliterated way. ""We\'re going to\nhave to move more of the men south. We simply haven\'t got water enough\nfor them. There\'d be enough in Tamanrasset, but not out here. Make a\nnote to cover this with Kenny. I wonder where Bey is, and Elmer.""\n\nIsobel made a note. She said, ""Yes, but the trouble is, he\'s a\ncomparative newcomer. Are you _sure_ he\'s in complete accord with the\noriginal plan, Homer? Does the El Hassan dream mean the same to him as\nit does to you, and ... well, me?""\n\nHe shot her an impatient glance, even as he hit the lift lever to\nraise them over a small dune. ""You and Dave don\'t hit it off very\nwell. He\'s a good man, so far as I can see.""\n\nHer delicate forehead wrinkled and her pixie face showed puzzlement.\n""I don\'t know why. I get along with most people, Homer.""\n\nHe patted her hand. ""You can\'t please everybody, Isobel. Listen,\nsomething\'s got to be done about this king-size mob of camp followers\nwe\'ve got. Did you know Common Europe sent in a delegation this\nmorning?""\n\n""Delegation? Common Europe--?""\n\n""Yeah. Haven\'t had time to discuss it with you. They found us just\nbefore we raised camp. Evidently, the British Commonwealth and\npossibly the Soviet Complex--some Chinese, I think--are also trying to\nlocate us. Half of these people are without their own equipment and\nsupplies, but that\'s not what worries me right now. We used to be able\nto camouflage our headquarters camp. Dig into the desert and avoid the\naircraft. But if a group of bungling Common Market diplomats can\nlocate us, what\'s to keep the Arab Legion from doing it and blessing\nus with a stick of neopalm bombs?""\n\nIsobel said, ""Look, before we leave Dave. Did you know he was\nconfiscating all radio equipment brought into our camp by the newsmen\nand whoever else?""\n\nHomer frowned. ""Well, why?""\n\n""Espionage, Dave says. He\'s afraid some of these characters might be\nin with the Arab Union and inform on us.""\n\n""Well, that makes some sense,"" Homer nodded.\n\n""Does it?"" Isobel grumbled.\n\nHe shot an irritated glance at her again and said impatiently, ""Can\'t\nthe poor guy do anything right?""\n\n""My woman\'s intuition is working,"" Isobel grumbled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDave Moroka came into headquarters tent without introduction. He was\none of the half dozen who had permission for this. He had a sheaf of\npapers in his left hand and was frowning unhappily.\n\n""What\'s the crisis?"" Homer said.\n\n""Scouts coming up say your pal Bey-ag-Akhamouk is on the way.\nEvidently, with a big harka of Teda from the Sudan.""\n\n""Great."" Homer crowed. ""Now we\'ll get going.""\n\n""Ha!"" Dave said. ""From what we hear, a good many are camel mounted.\nHow are we going to feed them? Already some of the Songhai Kenny\nbrought up from the south have drifted away, unhappy about supplies.""\n\n""Bey\'s a top man,"" Homer told him. ""The best. He\'ll have some ideas on\nour tactics. Meanwhile, we can turn over most of his men to one of the\nnew recruits, and head them down to take Fort Lamy. With Fort Lamy and\nLake Chad in our hands we\'ll control a chunk of Africa so big\neverybody else will start wondering why they shouldn\'t jump on the\nbandwagon while the going is good.""\n\nDave said, ""Well, that brings up something else, Homer. These new\nrecruits. In the past couple of days, forty or fifty men who used to\nbe connected with African programs sponsored by everybody from the\nReunited Nations to this gobblydygook outfit Cliff and Isobel once\nworked for, the AFAA, have come over to El Hassan. The number will\nprobably double by tomorrow, and triple the next day.""\n\n""Fine,"" Homer said. ""What\'s wrong with that? These are the people\nthat will really count in the long run.""\n\n""Nothing\'s wrong with it, within reason. But we\'re going to have to\nstart becoming selective, Homer. We\'ve got to watch what jobs we let\nthese people have, how much responsibility we give them.""\n\nHomer Crawford was frowning at him. ""How do you mean?""\n\n""See here,"" the wiry South African said plaintively, ""when El Hassan\nstarted off there were only a half dozen or so who had the dream, as\nyou call it. O.K. You could trust any one of them. Bey, Kenny, Elmer,\nCliff, this Jake Armstrong that you\'ve sent to New York, Rex\nDonaldson, then Jimmy and Jack Peters and myself. We all came in when\nthe going was rough, if not impossible. But now things are different.\n_It looks as though El Hassan might actually win._""\n\n""So?"" Homer didn\'t get it.\n\n""So from now on, you\'re going to have an infiltration of cloak and\ndagger lads from every outfit with an interest in North Africa.\nPotential traitors, potential assassins, subversives and what not.""\n\nHomer was scowling at him. ""Confound it, what do you suggest? That\nthese Johnny-Come-Latelies be second-class citizens?""\n\n""Not exactly that, but this isn\'t funny. We\'ve got to screen them. The\ntrouble with this movement is that it\'s a one-man deal, and has to be.\nThe average African is either a barbarian or an actual savage, one\nethnic degree lower. He wants a hero-symbol to follow. O.K., you\'re\nit. But remember both Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Their socio-economic\nsystems pyramided up to them. The Spanish conquistadores, being old\nhands at sophisticated European-type intrigue, quickly sized up the\nsituation. They kidnaped the hero-symbol, the big cheese, and later\nkilled him. And the Inca and the Aztec cultures collapsed.""\n\nHomer was scowling at him unhappily.\n\nDave summed it up. ""All we need is one fuzzy minded commie from the\nSoviet Complex, or one super-dooper democrat who thinks that El Hassan\nstands in the way of _freedom_, whatever that is, and bingo a couple\nof bullets in your tummy and the El Hassan movement folds its tents\nlike the Arabs and takes a powder, as the old expression goes.""\n\n""You have your point,"" Homer Crawford admitted. ""Follow through, Dave.\nFigure out some screening program.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCliff came in. ""Hey, Homer. Guess what old Jake has done.""\n\n""Jake Armstrong?""\n\n""He\'s swung the Africa for Africans Association in New York over to\nus. They\'ve raised a million bucks. What\'ll we do with it? How can he\nget anything to us?""\n\n""We\'ll have him plow it back into publicity and further fund raising\ncampaigns,"" Homer said. ""That\'s the way it\'s done. You raise some\nmoney for some cause and then spend it all on a bigger campaign to\nraise still more money, and what you get from that one you plow into a\nstill bigger campaign.""\n\nCliff said, ""Don\'t you _ever_ get anything out of it?""\n\nDave and Homer both laughed.\n\nCliff said, ""I\'ve got some still better news.""\n\n""Good news, we can use,"" Homer said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big Californian looked at him in pretended awe. ""A poet no less,""\nhe said.\n\n""Shut up,"" Homer said. ""What\'s the news?""\n\nThe fact of the matter was, he was becoming increasingly impatient of\nthe continual banter expected of him by Cliff and even the others. As\noriginal members of the team, they expected an intimacy that he was\nfinding it increasingly difficult to deliver. Among other things, he\nwished that Cliff, in particular, would mind his attitude when such\nfollowers as GuÃ©mama were present. The El Hassan posture could be\nmaintained only in never to be compromised dignity.\n\nBey had once compared him to Alexander, to Homer\'s amusement at the\ntime. But now he was beginning to sympathize with the position the\nMacedonian leader had found himself in, betwixt the King-God conscious\nPersians, and the rough and ready Companions who formed his bodyguard\nand crack cavalry units. A King-God simply didn\'t banter with his\nsubordinates, not even his blood-kin.\n\nCliff scowled at him now, at the sharpness of Homer\'s words, but he\nmade his report.\n\n""Our old pal, Sven Zetterberg. He\'s gone out on a limb. Because of the\ngreat danger of this so-far localized fight spreading into world-wide\nconflict--says old Sven--the Reunited Nations will not tolerate the\ncombat going into the air. He says that if _either_ El Hassan or the\nArab Legion resort to use of aircraft, the Reunited Nations will send\nin its air fleet.""\n\n""Wow,"" Homer said. ""All the aircraft we\'ve got are a few slow-moving\nheliocopters that Kenny brought up with him.""\n\nDave Moroka snapped his fingers in a gesture of elation. ""That means\nZetterberg is throwing his weight to our side.""\n\nHomer was on his feet. ""Send for Kenny and GuÃ©mama and send a\nheliocopter down to pick up Bey and rush him here. He shouldn\'t be\nmore than a day\'s march away. I wonder what Elmer is up to. No word at\nall from him. At any rate, we want an immediate council of war. With\nArab Legion air cover eliminated, we can move in.""\n\nCliff said sourly, ""It\'s still largely rifles against armored cars,\ntanks, mobile artillery and even flame throwers.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the old hands were present. They stood about a map table, Homer\nand Bey-ag-Akhamouk at one end, the rest clustered about. Isobel sat\nin a chair to the rear, stenographer\'s pad on her knees.\n\nBey was clipping out suggestions.\n\n""We have them now. Already our better trained men are heading up for\nTemassinine to the north and Fort Charlet to the east. We\'ll lose men\nbut we\'ll knock out every water hole between here and Libya. We\'ll cut\nevery road, blow what few bridges there are.""\n\nJack Peters said worriedly, ""But the important thing is Tamanrasset.\nWhat good--""\n\n""We\'re cutting their supply line,"" Bey told him. ""Can\'t you see?\nColonel Ibrahim and his motorized column will be isolated in\nTamanrasset. They won\'t be able to get supplies through without an air\nlift and Sven Zetterberg\'s ultimatum kills that possibility. They\'re\nblocked off.""\n\nJimmy Peters was as confused as his brother. ""So what? to use the\nAmericanism. They have both food and water in abundance. They can hold\nout indefinitely. Meanwhile, our forces are undisciplined irregulars.\nWe gain a thousand recruits a day. They come galloping in on\ncamel-back or in beat-up old vehicles, firing their hunting rifles\ninto the air. But we also lose a thousand a day. They get bored, or\nhungry, and decide to go back to their flocks, or their jobs on the\nnew Sahara projects. At any rate, they drift off again. It looks to me\nthat, if Colonel Ibrahim can hold out another week or so, our forces\nmight melt away--all except the couple of hundred or so European and\nAmerican educated followers. And, cut down to that number, they\'ll\neliminate us in no time flat.""\n\nHomer Crawford was eying him in humor. ""You\'re no fighting man,\nPeters. Tell me, what is the single most fearsome enemy of an\nultra-mechanized soldier with the latest in military equipment and\nsuper-firepower weapons?""\n\nJimmy Peters was blank. ""I suppose a similarly armed opponent.""\n\nHomer smiled at him. ""Rather, a man with a knife.""\n\nThe expressions of the Peters brothers showed resentment. ""We weren\'t\njesting.""\n\n""Neither was I,"" Homer rapped. He looked around at the rest, including\nBey and Kenny. ""What happens to a modern mechanized army when it runs\nout of gasoline? What happens to a water-cooled machine gun when there\nis no water? What use is a howitzer when the target is a single man in\nten acres of cover? Gentlemen, have any of you ever studied the\ntactics of Abd-el-Krim or, more recently still, Tito? Bey, I assume\nyou have.""\n\nHe had their attention.\n\n""During the Second War,"" Homer continued, ""this Yugoslavian Tito tied\nup two Nazi army corps with a handful of partisans--guerrillas. The\nmost modern army in the world, the German Panzers, tried to ferret him\nout for five years, and couldn\'t. There are other examples. The\nChinese operating against the Japs in the same war. Or one of the\nclassic examples is Abd-el-Krim destroying two different Spanish\narmies in the Moroccan Rif in the 1920s. His barefoot men, armed with\nrifles, took on Primo de Rivera\'s modernized Spanish armies and\ntrounced them.""\n\nBey said, ""Homer\'s right. Our only tactics are guerrilla ones.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked at GuÃ©mama, who had been standing in the\nbackground, unfamiliar with the language these others spoke, but\nholding his dignity. Crawford said, diplomatically, ""And what sayest\nthou, O chieftain of the Tuareg?""\n\nGuÃ©mama was gratified at the attention. He said in Tamaheq, ""As all\nmen know, O El Hassan, we now outnumber by thrice the Arab _giaours_\nmay they burn in Gehennum. Therefore, let us rush in and kill them\nall.""\n\nBey shuddered.\n\nHomer Crawford nodded seriously. ""Ai, GuÃ©mama, that would be the\nvalorous way of the Tuareg. But the heart of El Hassan forbids him to\nsacrifice the lives of his people. Consequently, we shall use the\ntactics of the desert jackal. Instruct those of your people who are\nmost cunning, to infiltrate Tamanrasset in the night. Let them not\ncarry arms for they may well be searched by the Arab _meleccha_.""\n\nThe Tuareg chieftain was intrigued. ""And what shall they do in\nTamanrasset, El Hassan? Suddenly seize arms, one night, and rise up in\nwrath against the Arab dogs and kill them all?""\n\nHomer was shaking his head. ""They will address themselves to the\nHaratin serfs and spread to them the message of El Hassan. They will\nbe told that in the world of El Hassan each man shall be free to seek\nhis own destiny to the extent his mind and abilities allow. And no man\nshall be the less because he was born a serf, and no man the more\nbecause he was born to wealth or power in the old days.""\n\n[Illustration]\n\n""Aiii,"" GuÃ©mama all but moaned. ""But such a message--""\n\n""Is the message of El Hassan, as all men know,"" Homer Crawford said\nflatly. He turned to Kenny Ballalou. ""Kenny, take over this angle. We\nwant as many propagandists in that town as possible. It\'s already\nchoked with refugees, most of them not knowing what they\'re fleeing.\nWe might get recruits there, too. But mostly we want to appeal to the\nsedentary natives in town. They\'ve got to get the dreams, too. Promise\nthem schools, land ... I don\'t have to tell you.""\n\n""Right,"" Kenny said.\n\nIsobel said, ""Maybe I ought to get in on this, too. The women might do\na better job than men on this slant. It\'s going to take a lot to get a\nTuareg bedouin to sink to talking to a Haratin on an equal basis.""\n\nBey and Homer had bent back over the maps, but before they could get\nback into the details of guerrilla warfare against Colonel Ibrahim and\nhis legionnaires, they were halted by a controversy from without.\n\n""What now?"" Homer growled. ""This camp is getting to be like a\nthree-ring circus.""\n\nThe entrance flap was pushed aside and three of Bey\'s Sudanese\ntribesmen half escorted, half pushed a newcomer front and center.\n\nIt was Fredric Ostrander, natty as usual, but now in khaki desert\nwear. He was obviously in a rage at the three rifle-carrying nomads\nwho had him in charge.\n\nBey spoke to the Teda warriors in their own tongue. Then to Homer in\nTamaheq, which he assumed the C.I.A. man didn\'t know, ""They picked him\nup in the desert in a hover-jeep. He was evidently looking for our\ncamp."" He dismissed the three bedouin with a gesture.\n\nOstrander was outraged. He snapped at Homer Crawford, ""I demand an\nexplanation of this cavalier attack upon--""\n\nHis face expressionless, Homer held up a hand to quiet the smaller\nman. He looked at Jack Peters and raised his eyebrows. ""_Kion li la\nfremdul diras?_""\n\nJack, serious as ever, replied in Esperanto, then turned to the\nAmerican C.I.A. man and said, ""El Hassan has requested that I\ntranslate for him. He speaks only the official language of North\nAfrica to foreign representatives. Undoubtedly, sir, you have proper\ncredentials?""\n\nHad Fredric Ostrander been of lighter complexion, his color would have\nundoubtedly gone dark red.\n\n""Look here, Crawford,"" he snapped. ""I\'m in no mood for nonsense. The\nState Department has sent me to your headquarters to make another\nattempt to bring some sense home to you. As an American citizen,\nowing alliance--""\n\nHomer Crawford spoke in Esperanto to Jack Peters who nodded seriously\nand said to Ostrander, ""El Hassan informs you he owes alliance only to\nthe people of North Africa whose chosen leader he is.""\n\nOstrander knew they were kidding him, but at the same time the stand\nbeing taken was actuality. He glared at the Americans present whom he\nknew, Bey, Isobel, Cliff and Kenny. He snapped, ""Very well, but I\nrepeat what I told you when last we met. The State Department of the\nUnited States of the Americas will not stand idly by and see this area\ntaken over by elements dominated by red subversives.""\n\n""Holy Mackerel,"" Cliff growled, ""are you still tooting that horn?""\n\nDave Moroka said sarcastically, ""It\'s an old wheeze. The definition of\na red subversive is anybody who doesn\'t see eye to eye with the United\nStates. They\'ve been pulling the gag for decades. Remember Guatemala\nand Cuba? Do anything that interferes with American business abroad\nand the cry goes up, _he\'s an enemy of the free world!_""\n\nOstrander spun on him, his eyes narrowing.\n\nDave laughed. ""The definition of members of the free world, of course,\nbeing anybody who follows the American line. Anybody is free, Spanish\nand Portuguese dictators, absolute monarchs in Arabia, Chinese\nwarlords, if they\'re on the American side.""\n\nOstrander snapped, ""I don\'t believe we\'ve met.""\n\nMoroka made a sweeping bow. ""I\'m afraid we don\'t move in the same\ncircles. I\'ve spent possibly a third of my life in prison--""\n\n""Undoubtedly,"" Ostrander snorted.\n\n""... Put there by people such as yourself--in various\ncountries--because I was fighting for my own version of freedom.""\n\n""Communism, undoubtedly!""\n\nMoroka said softly, ""I\'m a South African, sir. Both my parents were\nkilled in the 1960 riots. It seems that they had dark skins--even as\nyou and I--and weren\'t able to see why that should keep them from\n_freedom_.""\n\nFredric Ostrander spun back to Homer Crawford. ""I\'m not here to\nquibble with self-confessed malcontents. I\'ve been sent to represent\nthe State Department, to report to them, and, above all, to do what I\ncan to prevent your activities from redounding to the further\nadvantage of the Soviet Complex. I assume you can assign me quarters.""\n\nStraight-faced, Jack Peters translated this into Esperanto, and,\nstraight-faced, Homer answered in the same language.\n\nJack turned back to the impatient C.I.A. man. ""El Hassan welcomes the\nrepresentative of the United States of the Americas and hopes this\nwill be the first step toward diplomatic recognition between North\nAfrica and your great country. He has instructed me to find you\nquarters, which, possibly you may have to share with delegations from\nCommon Europe or""--Peters cleared his throat--""the Soviet Complex. He\nfurther suggests that it might be well, if you maintain communications\nwith your superiors, to have sent to you books on Esperanto, the\nofficial language of North Africa.""\n\nDave Moroka put in, ""By the way, we\'ll have to go through your things.\nWe can\'t allow any radio communication from El Hassan\'s camp, except\nthrough official El Hassan channels--for obvious military reasons.""\n\nOstrander snorted, stared indignantly at Homer again, spun on his heel\nand stalked from the tent. Jack Peters followed him but not before\ntipping an uncharacteristic wink at Homer.\n\nWhen they were gone, Homer sighed and looked at Dave Moroka. ""That\nreminds me, how are our other delegations coming?""\n\nThe South African grinned ruefully. ""They\'re playing it cool. Waiting\nto see what way to jump. Give El Hassan some real success, and they\'ll\nprobably jump at the chance to be first to recognize him. Especially\nthese Soviet Complex opportunists. They\'d just love to suck you into\ntheir camp.""\n\nIsobel looked at him. ""After that tearing down you gave poor Ostrander\nabout the United States, now you rip into the Soviet Complex. Just\nwhere do you stand, Dave?""\n\nDave shrugged her question off, as though there were more important\nthings. ""I\'m an El Hassan man,"" he said. ""Let those two overgrown\npowers handle their own troubles.""\n\nJimmy Peters spoke up for the first time since Ostrander entered the\ntent. ""You know,"" he said, seriously, ""I\'m beginning to wonder if the\nworld can afford nationalistic patriotism. Haven\'t we gone too far\nalong the road to think of ourselves any longer as Americans, or\nRussians, or French, or West Indians, or whatever? Hasn\'t the human\nrace grown up beyond that point?""\n\nKenny said mockingly, ""What! Aren\'t you proud of being a West Indian,\nand a loyal subject of Her Majesty?""\n\nPeters ignored his tone. ""Why should I be proud of my country? It was\nan accident of birth with which I had nothing to do, that made me a\nWest Indian, rather than a Canadian, a Chinese, a Norwegian, or\nwhatever. Intelligently, I should be proud only of things that I,\nmyself, have accomplished.""\n\nBey said, ""If we can stop waxing philosophic for a while and get back\nto how most efficiently to clobber these Arabs--""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hindu entered Kirill Menzhinsky\'s small office behind the Indian\nsouvenir shop in the Tangier Zocco Chico and said, ""The operative\nAnton is on the receiver.""\n\nThe agent superior of the _Chrezvychainaya Komissiya_ for North Africa\nlooked up from his desk and grunted acceptance of the message. He came\nto his feet and followed the other into a back room and took his place\nbefore a mouthpiece and screen.\n\nThe man whose party name was Anton nodded a greeting.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky said, ""It\'s about time I heard from you, Anton.""\n\n""Yes. But the situation has been such that it was not easy to report.""\n\n""And now?""\n\n""Briefly, I am at El Hassan\'s headquarters. You were correct. He is in\nactuality Homer Crawford. The others you mentioned are also with him,\nincluding the traitor Isobel Cunningham.""\n\nThe Soviet Complex\'s agent allowed his eyebrows to rise.\n\nAnton said flatly, ""The dame has evidently renounced the party and now\nholds high rank in Crawford\'s inner circle.""\n\n""And you?""\n\n""I am rapidly becoming his right-hand man. I am his press secretary\nand in charge of communications. Early in our acquaintanceship I was\nable to engineer an attempted assassination. I was able to, ah, save\nthe life of El Hassan.""\n\nThe Russian\'s eyes narrowed. ""The assassins? Is there any chance that\nthey might reveal your little trick?""\n\nAnton grimaced. ""I am not a fool, Kirill. Both of them were killed in\nthe assassination attempt. El Hassan was most grateful.""\n\n""I see. And how would you sum up the present situation?""\n\n""This area is swinging rapidly to El Hassan, but any sort of defeat\nand undoubtedly his followers would melt away. The bedouin are too\nvolatile. Before he ever makes any real headway he will have to take\nthe major commercial and industrial cities such as Dakar, Kano,\nLagos, Accra, Freetown, Khartoum, and eventually, of course, Cairo,\nCasablanca, Algiers and so forth.""\n\n""And our friend El Hassan leans not at all in our direction?""\n\nThe man the Party called Anton shook his head. ""He leans in no\ndirection, except that which will unite and modernize North Africa.\nNeither do his immediate followers. They\'re a well-knit group and it\nseems unlikely that I could pry any of them away from him in case it\nbecame desirable.""\n\n""I see,"" Kirill Menzhinsky muttered. ""I understand that a delegation\nfrom Moscow has arrived in El Hassan\'s camp. Have you contacted them?""\n\n""Certainly not. My orders were to rise in the El Hassan hierarchy and\nawait further orders. None of my current, ah, colleagues have any\nsuggestion that I am identified with the Party. Which reminds me, an\nAmerican C.I.A. man, Fredric Ostrander, has shown up. The fool seems\nto be under the impression that El Hassan is a Party tool.""\n\n""I know this Ostrander. Don\'t underestimate him, Anton. He\'s an\nextremely competent operative in the clutch, as the Americans call\nit.""\n\n""Perhaps. But nevertheless, there is no indication that the El Hassan\nmovement leans either to East or West, nor do I see any signs that it\nis apt to in the future.""\n\nThe Russian was scowling. ""I see. Then perhaps it will be necessary\nfor us to do something to topple our El Hassan before he becomes much\nstronger, and to find another to unite North Africa.""\n\nAnton frowned in his turn. ""I don\'t know. This man Crawford--and his\nfollowers, for that matter--are motivated by high ideals. As you have\nsaid, North Africa is not ready for our socio-economic system. Men of\nthe caliber of Homer Crawford could bring it into the modern age\nperhaps more quickly than another.""\n\nMenzhinsky chuckled. ""Don\'t worry about it, Anton. Such matters of\npolicy will be decided by others than you, or even me. Keep in touch\nwith me more often, in the future, Anton.""\n\n""Yes, Comrade."" His face faded from the screen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTamanrasset lies at an altitude of approximately 4,600 feet, about\naverage for the Ahaggar plateau. Around it, such peaks as the Tahat\nreach 9,600 feet above sea level. The country is rugged, jagged, bleak\nbeyond belief. With the possible exception of Southern Afghanistan in\nthe Khyber area, there is no place in the world more suited for\nguerrilla warfare, less suited for the proper utilization of modern\narmor, particularly when the latter is forced to work without air\ncover.\n\nHomer Crawford, equipped with an old-style telescope, was\nspread-eagled on top a rock outcropping, his only companion Isobel\nCunningham. Directly before him, possibly two miles in distance, was\nthe desert city of Tamanrasset, to the right, a kilometer or so, Amsel\nwhere palatable water was to be found at eighteen meters depth.\n\n""Our friend, the colonel, is up to something,"" he grumbled.\n\nShe had a pair of binoculars, of considerably less power than his\nglass.\n\n""It looks as though GuÃ©mama\'s boys are on the run,"" she said.\n\n""As per orders. The primary theory of partisan warfare is not to get\nkilled. The guerrilla never stands and fights. If the regular forces\nhe opposes can bring him to bay, they\'ve got him."" He interrupted\nhimself to clip out, ""Look at that tank, darling! There on the left!""\n\nIsobel tightened, looked at him quickly from the side of her eyes. No.\nHe\'d said it inadvertently, his mind concentrated on the fighting men\nbelow. She had often wondered where she stood with Homer Crawford the\nman, as opposed to El Hassan the idealist. The tip of her tongue\nlicked the side of her mouth, as she surreptitiously took him in. But\nCrawford the man would have to wait, there was no time, no time.\n\nIsobel swung her glasses. ""The one starting to go in a circle? There,\nit stopped.""\n\n""One of the snipers got its commander,"" Homer said. ""You can\'t fight a\ntank without the commander\'s head being up through the hatch. That\'s a\npopular fallacy. You can\'t see well enough to fight your tank unless\nyou\'ve got your head up. And that\'s suicide when you\'re against\nguerrillas. The colonel ought to send his infantry out first.""\n\nIsobel said, ""What did you mean when you said that he\'s up to\nsomething?""\n\nHomer\'s eye was still glued to the eyepiece of his glass. ""He\'s leaving\nhis entrenchments and sending his vehicles out to capture our ... our\nstrong points.""\n\n""You mean our water, don\'t you?""\n\nBey came snaking up to them on his belly. He came abreast of Homer and\nbrought forth his own binoculars. He watched for a moment and then\nmuttered a curse under his breath.\n\n""GuÃ©mama better start pulling back those men more quickly,"" he said.\n\n""He will. He\'s a good man,"" Homer told him. ""What\'s up?""\n\n""Evidently, Colonel Ibrahim has decided to come out of retirement.\nHe\'s sent small motorized elements to Effok, In Fedjeg, Otoul and even\nto Tahifet.""\n\n""And--?""\n\n""And has taken them all, of course. Our men fall back, fighting a\nstubborn rear-guard action, taking as few casualties as possible.""\n\n""I don\'t get it,"" Homer bit out. ""He\'s using up his fuel and\nammunition and losing more men than we are. Certainly he can\'t figure,\nwith the thousand odd troops he has, to be able to take and hold\nenough of the oases and water holes in this vicinity to push us out\ncompletely.""\n\nBey said, ""What worries me is the possibility that he knows something\nwe don\'t. That he\'s figuring on being relieved or has a new source of\nfuel, ammunition and men on tap.""\n\n""The roads are cut. Our men hold every source of water from here to\nLibya and the Reunited Nations has put thumbs down on aircraft which\neliminates an air lift.""\n\n""Yeah,"" Bey said, unhappily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening, following the day\'s last meal, Cliff came into the\nheadquarters tent grinning, broadly. ""Hey, guess what we\'ve\nliberated.""\n\n""A bottle of Scotch?"" Kenny said hopefully.\n\n""A king-size portable radio transmitter. Ralph Sandell knew about it.\nThe Sahara Afforestation Project people were going to use it to\npropagandize the tribesmen into coming in and taking jobs in the new\noases.""\n\nDave Moroka, who\'d been censoring press releases, shook his head.\n""That\'s why we need an El Hassan in this country,"" he complained.\n""They put a couple of million dollars into a radio transmitter, never\nasking themselves how many of the bedouin own radios.""\n\nJack Peters said, ""Wait a moment, you chaps. Didn\'t Bey capture a\ncouple of Arab Legion radio technicians today?""\n\n""They defected to us,"" Homer Crawford said, looking up from an\nimprovised desk where he was poring over some supply papers with\nIsobel. ""What did you have in mind, Jack?""\n\n""There are radios in Tamanrasset. In fact, there\'s probably a radio in\nevery one of those military vehicles of Ibrahim\'s. Why can\'t we\nblanket these Arab Union chaps with El Hassan propaganda? Quite a few\nof them are from Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. In short, they\'re Africans\nand susceptible to El Hassan\'s dream.""\n\n""Good man. Take over the details, Jack,"" Homer said. He went back to\nhis work with Isobel.\n\nJimmy Peters entered with some papers in hand. He said, seriously,\n""The temperature is rising in the Reunited Nations--and everywhere\nelse, for that matter. Damascus and Cairo have been getting\nincreasingly belligerent. Homer, it looks as though the Arab Union is\ngetting ready to go out on a limb. Weeks have passed since Colonel\nIbrahim first took Tamanrasset and the Reunited Nations, the United\nStates, the Soviet Complex and all others interested in North Africa,\nhave failed to do anything. Everybody, evidently, afraid of\nprecipitating something that couldn\'t be ended.""\n\nAll eyes went to Homer Crawford who ran a black hand back over his\nhair in weariness. ""I know,"" he said. ""Something is about to blow.\nDave has sent some of his best men into Tamanrasset to pick up gossip\nin the souks. Morale was dragging bottom among the legionnaires just a\ncouple of days ago. Now they seem to have a new lease.""\n\n""In spite of the sabotage our people have been committing?"" Isobel\nsaid.\n\n""That\'s falling off somewhat,"" Cliff said. ""At first our more\nenthusiastic followers were able to pull everything from heaving\nMolotov Cocktails into tanks, to pouring sugar in hover-jeep gas\ntanks, but the legionnaires have both smartened up and gotten very\ntough.""\n\n""Good,"" Dave Moroka said now.\n\nThey looked at him.\n\n""Atrocities,"" he said. ""In order to guard against sabotage, the\nlegionnaires will be taking measures that will antagonize the people\nin Tamanrasset. They\'ll shoot a couple of teenage kids, or something,\nthen they\'ll have a city-wide mess on their hands.""\n\nIsobel said unhappily, ""It seems a nasty way to win a war.""\n\nDave grunted his contempt of her opinion. ""There is no way of winning\na war other than a nasty one.""\n\nBey came in, yawning hugely. His energy was inconceivable to the\nothers. So far as was known, he hadn\'t slept, other than sitting erect\nin a moving vehicle, for the past four days. He said to Homer, ""Fred\nOstrander has been bending my ear for the past hour or so. Do you want\nto talk to him?""\n\n""About what?"" Homer said.\n\n""I don\'t know. He has a lot of questions. I think he\'s beginning to\nsuspect--just _suspect_, understand--that possibly the whole bunch of\nus aren\'t receiving our daily instructions from either Moscow or\nPeking.""\n\nDave and Cliff both laughed.\n\nHomer sighed and said, ""Show him in. He\'s the only thing we have in\nthe way of a contact with the United States of the Americas and sooner\nor later we\'re going to have to make our peace with both them and the\nSoviet Complex. In fact, what we\'re probably going to have to do is\nplay one against the other, getting grants, loans, economic\nassistance--""\n\n""Technicians, teachers, arms,"" Bey continued the list.\n\nKenny Ballalou looked at him and snorted. ""Arms! If there\'s anything\nthis part of the world doesn\'t need it\'s more arms. In fact, that goes\nfor the rest of the world, too. In the old days when the great nations\nwere first beginning to attempt to line up the neutrals they sent aid\nto such countries by the billions--and most of it in arms. How\nridiculous can you get? Putting arms in the hands of most of the\ngovernments of that time was like handing a loaded pistol to an\nidiot.""\n\nBey hung his head in mock humility. ""I bow before your wisdom,"" he\nsaid. He left the room to get Ostrander.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe C.I.A. man had lost a fraction of his belligerence, but none of\nhis arrogance and natty appearance. Homer wondered vaguely how the\nother managed to remain so spruce in the inadequate desert camp.\n\nJack Peters said, ""What did you wish to ask El Hassan? I will\ntranslate.""\n\n""Never mind that, Jack,"" Homer said. ""We\'ll get tougher about using\nour official language when we\'ve gone a little further in building\nour new government."" He said to Ostrander, ""What can I do for you?\nObviously, my time, is limited.""\n\nFredric Ostrander said, ""I\'ve been gathering material for reports to\nmy superiors. I\'ve been doing a good deal of questioning, and,\nfrankly, even prying around.""\n\nCliff grunted.\n\nOstrander went on. ""I\'ve also read the various press releases,\nmanifestoes and so forth that your assistants have been compiling.""\n\n""We know,"" Homer said. ""We haven\'t put any obstacles in your way. We\nhaven\'t any particular secrets, Mr. Ostrander.""\n\n""You disguise the fact that you are an American,"" the C.I.A. man said\naccusingly.\n\nHomer said slowly, ""Only because El Hassan _is not_ an American, Mr.\nOstrander. He is an African with African solutions to African\nproblems. That is what he must be if he is to accomplish his task.""\n\nOstrander seemed to switch subjects. ""See here, Crawford, the State\nDepartment is not completely opposed to the goal of uniting North\nAfrica. It would solve many problems, both African and international.""\n\nKenny Ballalou laughed softly. ""You mean, you\'re on our side?""\n\nOstrander turned to him, for once not incensed at being needled.\n""Possibly more than you\'d think,"" he rapped. He turned back again to\nHomer Crawford. ""The question becomes, why do you think that _you_ are\nthe man for the job? Who gave _you_ the go-ahead?""\n\nBey, who had settled down into a folding camp chair, now came to his\nfeet, his tired face angry.\n\nBut Homer waved him to silence. ""Hold it,"" he said. Then to Ostrander.\n""It doesn\'t work that way. It\'s not something you decide to do because\nyou\'re thirsty for power, or greedy for money. You\'re pushed into it.\nDo you think Washington, a retired Virginian planter wrapped up in his\nestate and his family, wanted to spend years leading the revolutionary\narmies through the wilderness that was America in those days? He was\nthrust into the job, there was no one else more competent to take it.\nMen make the times, Ostrander, but the times also make the men. Look\nat Lenin and Trotsky. Three months before the October Revolution,\nLenin wrote that he never expected to see in his lifetime the\nBolsheviks come to power. Within those months he was at the head of\ngovernment and Trotsky, a former bookworm who had never fired a gun in\nhis life, was head of the Red Army and being proclaimed a military\ngenius.""\n\nOstrander was scowling at him, but his face was thoughtful.\n\nHomer said quietly, ""It\'s not always an easy thing, to have power thrust\ninto your hands. Not always a desirable thing."" His voice went quieter\nstill. ""Only a short time ago it led me to the necessity of ...\nkilling ... my best friend.""\n\n""And mine,"" Isobel said softly, almost under her breath.\n\nDave Moroka said, ""Abe Baker,"" before he caught himself.\n\nKenny Ballalou looked at him strangely. ""Did you know Abe?""\n\nThe South African recovered. ""I\'ve heard several of you mention him\nfrom time to time. He was a commie, wasn\'t he?""\n\n""Yes,"" Homer said without inflection. ""And a man. He saved my life on\nmore than one occasion. As long as we worked together with only Africa\nin mind, there was no conflict. But Abe had a further, and, to him,\ngreater alliance.""\n\nHe turned his attention back to the C.I.A. man. ""A man does what he\nmust do,"" he finished simply. ""I did not ask to become El Hassan.""\n\nOstrander said, ""Your motivation is possibly beside the point. The\nthing is that the battle for men\'s minds continues and your program,\neventually, must align with the West.""\n\n""And get clobbered in the stampeding around between the two great\npowers,"" Kenny said dryly.\n\n""You\'ve got to take your stand,"" Ostrander said. ""I\'d rather die under\nthe neutron bomb, than spend the rest of my life on my knees under a\nSoviet Complex government. Wouldn\'t you?"" His eyes went from one of\nthem to the other, defiantly.\n\nHomer said slowly. ""No, even though that was the only alternative,\nwhich is unlikely. Not if it meant finishing off the whole human race\nat the same time."" He shook his head. ""If it were only me, it might be\ndifferent. But if it was a matter of nuclear war the whole race might\nwell end. Given such circumstances, I\'d be proud to remain on my\nknees the rest of my life. You see, Ostrander, you make the mistake of\nthinking the Soviet socio-economic system is a permanent thing. It\nisn\'t. It\'s changing daily, even as our own socio-economic system is.\nEven if the Soviet Complex were to dominate the whole world, it would\nbe but a temporary phase in man\'s history. Their regime, in its time,\nright or wrong, will go under in man\'s march to whatever his destiny\nmight be. Some day it will be only a memory, and so will the\nsocio-economic systems of the West. No institutions are less permanent\nthan politico-economic ones.""\n\n""I don\'t agree with you,"" Ostrander snapped.\n\n""Obviously,"" Homer shrugged. ""However, this is another problem. El\nHassan deals with North Africa. The other problems you bring up we\nadmit, but at this stage are not dealing with them. Our dream is in\nAfrica. Perhaps the Africans will be forced to taking other stands, to\ndreaming new dreams, twenty or thirty years from now. When that time\ncomes, I assume the new problems will be faced. By that time there\nwill probably be no need for El Hassan.""\n\nOstrander looked at him and bit his lip in thought.\n\nIt came to him now that he had never won in his contests with Homer\nCrawford, and that he would probably never win. No matter how strong\nhis convictions, in the presence of the other man, something went out\nof him. There was strength in Crawford that must be experienced to be\nunderstood. When he talked, he held you, and your own opinions became\nnothing--stupidities on your lips. He had a dream, and in conversation\nwith him, all other things dropped away and nothing was of importance\nbut that dream. A dream? Possibly _disease_ was the better word. And\nso highly contagious.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhile they talked, an aide had entered and handed a report to\nBey-ag-Akhamouk. He read it and closed his eyes in weariness.\n\n""What\'s up, Bey,"" Homer asked.\n\n""I don\'t know. Colonel Ibrahim has stepped up his attacks in all\ndirections. At least two thirds of his force is on the offensive. It\ndoesn\'t make much sense. But it must make sense to _him_, or he\nwouldn\'t be doing it.""\n\nOstrander said, and to everyone\'s surprise there seemed to be an\nelement of worry in his voice too, ""I know Colonel Midan Ibrahim, met\nhim in Cairo and in Baghdad on various occasions. He\'s considered one\nof the best men in the Arab Legion. He doesn\'t make military\nblunders.""\n\nBey said, ""Come on, Kenny. Let\'s round up GuÃ©mama and take a look at\nthe front."" He led the way from the tent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a guard posted before the tent which doubled as press and\ncommunications center, and the private quarters of David Moroka.\n\nThe figure that approached timidly was garbed in the traditional\nclothing of the young women of the TÃ©gÃ©hÃ© Mellet tribe of the Tuareg\nand bore an _imzad_ in her left hand, while her right held a corner of\nher gandoura over her face.\n\nThe guard, of the Kel Rela tribe, eyed the one-stringed violin with\nits string of hair and sounding box made of half a gourd covered with\na thin membrane of skin, and grinned. A Tuareg maid was accustomed to\nsing and to make the high whining tones of desert music on the _imzad_\nbefore submitting to her lover\'s embrace. _Wallahi!_ but these women\nof the TÃ©gÃ©hÃ© Mellet were shameless.\n\n""Where do you go?"" he said gruffly. ""El Hassan\'s vizier has ordered\nthat he is occupied and none should approach.""\n\n""He awaits me,"" she wavered. There was _kohl_ about her eyes, and\nindigo at the corners of her mouth. ""We met at the _tendi_ last night\nand he bid me come to his tent. It is for me he waits.""\n\n_Wallahi!_ but his leader had taste, the sentry decided.\n\n""Pass,"" he said gruffly. Even a vizier of such importance as this one\nmust need solace at times, he decided philosophically.\n\nShe slipped past silently to the tent entrance where the Tuareg guard\nnoticed she paused for a long moment before entering. He grinned into\nhis teguelmoust. Aiii, the little bird was timid before the hawk.\n\nShe stood for a moment listening, and then slipped inside, dropping\nthe desert musical instrument to the ground. Dave Moroka\'s back was to\nher and even as she entered he flicked off the switch of the\nvideo-radio into which he had been speaking and scowled at it.\n\nWhen he stood and began to turn, she covered him with the small pocket\npistol. She had an ease in handling it which denoted competence.\n\nHis eyebrows went up, but he remained silent, waiting for her gambit.\n\nIsobel said evenly, ""You\'re a Party member, aren\'t you, Dave?""\n\n""Why do you say that?""\n\nShe nodded infinitesimally to the set. ""You were reporting just now. I\nheard enough just as I came in.""\n\nHe took in her disguise. ""My guard isn\'t as efficient as I had\nthought,"" Dave said wryly.\n\nIsobel said, ""You knew Abe Baker, didn\'t you?""\n\nHe looked at her, expressionlessly.\n\nShe said, ""I already knew you belonged to the Party, Dave. No matter\nhow competent an agent, it\'s something difficult to hide from any\nother long-time member. There\'s a terminology you use--such as calling\nit the Soviet Union, rather than Russia. No commie ever says Russia,\nit\'s always _the Soviet Union_. You can tell, just as a Roman Catholic\ncan tell a person raised in the Church, even though the other has\ndropped away, or even as one Jew can tell another. Yes, I\'ve known\nyou were a Party member for some time, Dave.""\n\n""And?"" the South African said.\n\n""Why are you here?""\n\nDave Moroka said, ""For the same reason you are, to further the El\nHassan dream, the uniting and modernization of the continent of my\nracial heritage.""\n\n""But you are still a Party member and still report to your superiors.""\n\nDave Moroka looked at the tiny gun she held in her hand.\n\n""Don\'t try it,"" she said. ""I have seen you in action, Dave. I have\nnever seen a man move so ruthlessly fast ... but don\'t try it.""\n\n""No reason to,"" he bit out. ""Come on, let\'s go see Homer.""\n\nShe was slightly taken aback, but not enough to release her control\nfor even a split second. ""Lead the way,"" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven at this time of evening, the headquarters tent was brightly lit\nand most of the immediate El Hassan staff still at work. Homer\nCrawford looked up as they entered.\n\nCliff Jackson saw the gun first and said, ""Holy Mackerel, Isobel.""\n\nFredric Ostrander was sitting to one side in discussion with the sober\nfaced Jack Peters. He took in the gun and slowly came to his feet,\nobviously expecting climax.\n\nIsobel said, ""Dave\'s taking over control of communications had method.\nI just found him reporting to what must have been a superior ... in\nthe Party.""\n\nHomer Crawford looked from the South African to Isobel, then back to\nDave again, without speaking. His eyes were questioning.\n\nDave said, his voice sharp. ""I haven\'t time for details now. Isobel\'s\nright. I was a Party member.""\n\n""Was?"" Ostrander chuckled. ""That\'s the understatement of the year. I\nhadn\'t got around to revealing the fact as yet, but our friend Dave is\nthe notorious Anton, one of the Soviet Complex\'s most competent\nhatchetmen.""\n\nDave looked at him only briefly. ""Was,"" he reiterated. He turned his\nattention to Homer and to Bey, who was staring tired dismay at this\nnew addition to the load.\n\nHomer still held his peace, waiting for the other to go on.\n\n""I found out tonight why Colonel Ibrahim is attacking, instead of\npulling in his horns as reason would dictate."" Dave paused for\nemphasis. ""The Soviet Complex has thrown its weight, in this matter at\nleast, on the side of the Arab Union. They have insisted that Sven\nZetterberg be dismissed as head of the Sahara Division of the African\nDevelopment Project and that his threat to use Reunited Nations\naircraft if the local fighting spreads to the air, be repudiated.""\n\nKenny blurted, ""Good grief ... that means--""\n\nDave looked around at them, one by one. ""It means,"" he said, ""that the\nArab Legion is going to be reinforced tomorrow morning by a full\nregiment of paratroopers.""\n\n""Holy Mackerel,"" Cliff groaned. ""We\'ve had it. Another regiment of\ncrack troops in Tamanrasset and we\'ll _never_ take the town.""\n\nDave shook his head. ""That\'s not the big thing. The paratroopers\naren\'t going to drop in Tamanrasset. They\'re going to hit every oasis,\nevery water hole, in a circumference of two hundred miles.""\n\nThere was an empty silence.\n\nHomer Crawford said finally, evenly, ""In the expectation that every\nfollower of El Hassan in the Sahara will either surrender or die of\nthirst, eh?"" He didn\'t seem sufficiently impressed by the threatening\ndisaster. He looked at Dave questioningly. ""Why do you bother to tell\nus, Dave, if you\'re on the other side?""\n\nDave grunted sour amusement. ""Because I\'ve just become a full member\nof the team. I resigned from the Party tonight.""\n\n""Brother,"" Bey said, ""you sure pick a helluva time to join up."" He\nobviously was expressing the opinions of the majority.\n\nHomer Crawford came to his feet and looked around at them. ""All\nright,"" he said. ""A new complication. Let\'s face up to it. There\'s\nalways an answer. We\'re in the clutch, let\'s fight our way out.""\n\nLargely, they stared at him, but he ignored their dismay. He looked\nfrom one to the other. ""We need some ideas. Let\'s kick it around.\nIsobel, Cliff, Jack, Kenny--?"" His eyes went from one to the other.\nObviously his own mind was churning.\n\nThey shook their heads dumbly.\n\nKenny said, ""Ideas! We\'ve had it, Homer!""\n\nHomer Crawford spun on him and now the force they all knew was\nemanating from him. He laughed his scorn. ""A month ago we were half a\ndozen fugitives. Now we\'re an army besieging a city. And you say we\'ve\nhad it? Listen, Kenny, if we have to we\'ll go back to being half a\ndozen fugitives again--those of us that are left. But the dream goes\non! However, we\'re not going to have to. We\'re too near victory in\nthis stage of the operation to sit down on the job because of a\nthreatened reverse. Now then, let\'s kick it around. Jimmy! Dave!\nKenny! Ostrander!""\n\nFredric Ostrander raised his eyebrows only slightly at being included\nin their number.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey, for once, was seemingly too exhausted to be brought to new\nenthusiasm. He tossed a detail map of Tamanrasset to the table. ""And\nI\'d just worked out a bang-up scheme for infiltrating into town,\njoining up with our adherents there, and seizing it while most of\nIbrahim\'s men were out in the desert, trying to capture our nearer\nwater holes.""\n\nHomer snapped, ""It sounds like it still might have possibilities.""\n\nOstrander looked down at the map, his face very tight. ""How long would\nit take?""\n\nBey scowled at him, defeat dulling his mind. ""What?""\n\n""How long do you figure it would take to infiltrate Tamanrasset and\ncapture it? Behind Ibrahim\'s back, so to speak.""\n\nBey grunted. ""A couple of hours in the early morning. I had a\nbeautiful picture of the colonel\'s armor out in the desert, cut off\nfrom its petroleum supplies and ammunition dump while we held the\ntown. Some of our men, the former veterans of the French West African\nforces, could have even operated the antitank guns he has mounted at\nFort Laperrine.""\n\nThe C.I.A. man\'s mouth worked.\n\nHomer Crawford\'s eyes pierced him.\n\nOstrander walked over to the radio before which Kenny Ballalou sat.\n""See if you can raise Colonel Ibrahim for me.""\n\nKenny scowled at him. ""Why?""\n\n""Do it.""\n\nKenny looked at Homer Crawford.\n\nHomer said, ""O.K. Do it.""\n\nKenny shrugged and turned to the set. While the others watched,\nCrawford\'s face alert, his eyes narrowed, the rest of them dull in\napathy, the face of Colonel Ibrahim finally faded in on the screen.\n\nFredric Ostrander took his place at the instrument. He nodded,\nformally. ""Greetings, Colonel, it seems a long time since last we met\nin Amman.""\n\nThe Arab Legion officer smiled politely. ""I had heard that you\nrepresented the State Department in this area, Mr. Ostrander, and have\nbeen somewhat surprised that you failed to make Tamanrasset your\nheadquarters. It would have been pleasant to have renewed old\nfriendship.""\n\nOstrander cleared his throat. ""I am afraid that would have been\ndifficult, Colonel, particularly in view of the stand of my government\nat this time.""\n\nOn the screen, the other\'s eyebrows went up.\n\nOstrander said evenly, ""Colonel, we have just been informed that a\nregiment of paratroopers has been put at your disposal and that they\nplan to land at various points in the Sahara in the morning.""\n\nThe colonel said stiffly, ""This is military information which I am not\nfree to discuss, Mr. Ostrander.""\n\nFrederic Ostrander went on, his voice still even. ""We have further\nbeen informed that the Reunited Nations has withdrawn its ban on\naircraft, which would seem to free your paratroop carrying planes.""\n\nThe colonel remained silent, waiting for the bombshell. It was obvious\nthat he expected a bombshell.\n\nOstrander said, ""As representative of the State Department I warn you\nthat if these paratroop carrying planes take off tomorrow morning, the\nSeventh Airfleet of the United States of the Americas will enter the\nconflict on the side of El Hassan. Good evening, Colonel.""\n\nThe C.I.A. man reached out and flicked the switch that killed the set.\nThen he took the snowy white handkerchief from the breast pocket of\nhis jacket and wiped his mouth.\n\nIsobel said, ""Heavens to Betsy.""\n\nKenny said indignantly, ""Good grief, you fool, it won\'t take more than\nhours for your superiors to repudiate you. Then what happens?""\n\n""By then, I assume, the battle will be over and Tamanrasset in El\nHassan\'s hands. The Arab Union will then think twice before committing\ntheir paratroopers, particularly with captured armor in El Hassan\'s\nhands.""\n\n""And your name will be mud,"" Kenny blurted.\n\nOstrander looked at Homer Crawford. ""Gentlemen, you must remember that\nI, too, am an African. I had thought that perhaps there would be a\nposition for me on El Hassan\'s staff.""\n\nCrawford reached for the Tommy-Noiseless that leaned up against the\nimprovised desk at which he worked. He said, ""Let\'s get moving, Bey.\nWe haven\'t much time. We\'re going to have to be able to announce its\ncapture _from_ Tamanrasset in a couple of hours.""\n\n""Not you,"" Bey said, grabbing up his own weapon and motioning with his\nhead for Kenny and Cliff to come along. ""You\'re El Hassan and can\'t be\nrisked.""\n\n""I\'m coming,"" Homer said flatly. ""It\'s about time El Hassan began\ntaking some of the same risks his followers seem to be willing to\nface. Besides, the men will fight better with me out in front. Got a\ngun, Fred?""\n\nOstrander said, ""No. Where am I issued one?""\n\n""I\'ll show you,"" Homer said, stuffing extra clips in his bush jacket\npockets. ""Come on, Dave.""\n\nThe whole group began heading for the open air, Bey already yelling\norders.\n\nFredric Ostrander looked at Dave Moroka. ""Strange bedfellows,"" he\nsaid.\n\nMoroka grinned wryly. ""My long view hasn\'t changed,"" he said. ""It\'s\njust that this African matter takes precedence right now.""\n\n""Nor mine, of course,"" Ostrander said. He cleared his throat.\n""However, I hope you last out the night. El Hassan needs strong men.""\n\n""Same to you,"" Moroka said gruffly. ""Let\'s get going, or the fight\nwill be over while we hand each other flowers.""\n\n\n_Epilogue_\n\nEl Hassan stood in the smoking, war-wasted ruin of Fort Laperine, his\nmind empty. The body of Jack Peters was ten feet to his left, burned\nbeyond recognition and crumpled over a flame thrower which he\'d\neliminated in the last few moments of the fighting. Had he let his\neyes go out the gun port before which he stood, it might have been\npossible for El Hassan to have picked out the bodies of David Moroka\nand Fredric Ostrander amidst those of the several hundred Haratin\nserfs who had swarmed out of the souk area at the crucial moment and\nstormed the half manned fort--unarmed save for knives and farm\nimplements.\n\nTo his right, Dr. Warren Harding Smythe supervised two Tuareg who were\ncarrying off the broken body of Kenny Ballalou; there was still faint\nlife in it.\n\nThe doctor looked at him. ""You are satisfied, I assume?""\n\nEl Hassan failed to hear him.\n\nSmythe turned and stomped off, following his impressed nurses.\n\nIn the distance, Bey-ag-Akhamouk called hoarse orders from an\nover-strained throat, placing guns for a counterattack that would\nnever come. The Arab Legion was broken and Colonel Ibrahim a prisoner.\nLarge numbers of the survivors were defecting to the banner of El\nHassan.\n\nHe threw his empty Tommy-Noiseless to the side. All he wanted now was\nsleep, the surcease of a few hours of oblivion.\n\nIsobel, her face wan from the horror of the agony of the combat whose\nresult was everywhere visible, was picking her way through the\nwreckage with Cliff Jackson.\n\nEl Hassan looked at her absently. Whatever message she bore held\nlittle interest to him.\n\nCliff said, ""India has recognized El Hassan as legal head of state of\nall North Africa. It is expected that Australia will follow before the\nweek is out.""\n\nEl Hassan nodded. For the time, not caring.\n\nIsobel said, ""We have other word. It came by messenger."" She closed\nher eyes in pain and handed him a small box.\n\nHe opened it and recognized the ring on the enclosed finger. He looked\nup at them.\n\nCliff Jackson growled low in his throat. ""Elmer Allen. He\'s been\ncaptured by a leader of the Ouled Touameur clan of the Ouled Allouch\ntribe. You know this Abd-el-Kader?""\n\nEl Hassan was staring down at the finger, his mind slowly clearing of\nits fatigue. ""He belongs to the Berazga division of the Chaambra\nconfederation. I had a run-in with him a few months ago and had him\njailed. He\'s nothing but a desert bandit on the make.""\n\nCliff said, ""He\'s escaped, has thrown his weight behind the Arab\nUnion, proclaimed himself the Mahdi and is uniting Algeria and parts\nof Morocco and Tunisia like a wildfire. The marabouts and Shorfa are\nbacking him.""\n\n""Proclaimed himself the Mahdi?"" Isobel said in question.\n\nEl Hassan turned to the girl and took a deep breath. ""The original\nMahdi was the holiest prophet since Mohammed and according to the more\nsuperstitious Moslems, he\'s still alive. According to Islamic\ntradition, he periodically shows up again in the desert and makes\nvarious predictions. When he does, it almost always winds up with a\njihad, a holy war. Don\'t you remember in history the anti-British\nMahdi at Khartoum, the killing of Chinese Gordon and so forth? That\nMahdi was the son of a Dongola carpenter and he managed to conquer two\nmillion square miles in two years.""\n\n""But, what has this got to do with this Abd-el-Kader?""\n\n""He\'s evidently proclaimed himself sort of a reincarnation of the\noriginal Mahdi. He\'s out to do the same thing we are--to unite North\nAfrica. But in his case he doesn\'t exactly have the same dream and\nhe\'s working under the green ensign of the Pan-Islamic Arab Union.""\n\n""And has Elmer Allen captive.""\n\n""Yes, he has Elmer."" El Hassan\'s tone of voice turned sharp. ""Cliff,\ngo get Bey. Tell him we\'re forming a flying column and heading north.""\n\nCliff was gone. El Hassan turned back to the girl. ""You know, Isobel,""\nhe said softly, slowly, ""in history there is no happy ending, ever.\nThere is no ending at all. It goes from one crisis to another, but\nthere is no ending.""\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Border, Breed Nor Birth, by Dallas McCord Reynolds\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BORDER, BREED NOR BIRTH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30639-8.txt or 30639-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/6/3/30639/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'}","{'text': 'Who is captured by Dr. Crawfords group and then forced to join them?', 'tokens': array(['Who', 'is', 'captured', 'by', 'Dr.', 'Crawfords', 'group', 'and',

THE END', 'summary': {'text': ' In Cleveland, 1972, Russell Stevens Jr. is the son of a drug addicted, alcoholic man. His father tells his son never to be like him. Stevens then witnesses his father getting killed while robbing a liquor store. He swears that he will never end up the way he has.\nTwenty years later, in Cincinnati, 1991, Stevens is now a police officer. Officer Stevens is recruited by DEA Special Agent Gerald Carver to go undercover on a major sting operation in Los Angeles, claiming that his criminal-like character traits will be more of a benefit undercover than they would serve him as a uniformed policeman. Stevens poses as drug dealer ""John Hull"" in order to infiltrate and work his way up the network of the west coast\'s largest drug importer, Anton Gallegos and his uncle Hector Gúzman, a South American politician. Stevens relocates to a cheap hotel in LA and begins dealing cocaine.\nOne day Stevens is arrested by the devoutly religious L.A.P.D. Narcotics Detective Taft and his corrupt partner Hernández, when he buys a kilogram in a set-up by Gallegos\' low-level street supplier Eddie Dudley. At his arraignment, Stevens discovers that he was sold ""baby laxative"" (mannitol) instead of cocaine and his case is dismissed. Stevens\' self-appointed attorney David Jason, who is also a drug trafficker in Gallegos\' network, rewards Stevens\' silence with more cocaine and introduces Stevens to Felix Barbossa, the underboss to Gallegos. Felix realized that Eddie was working with the LAPD, which results in Felix killing him and enlisting Stevens as Eddie\'s replacement.\nStevens develops a romance with Betty McCutcheon, the manager of an art dealership which serves as a front to launder Jason\'s drug money profits. When one of Stevens\' dealers is murdered by a rival dealer named Ivy, Stevens kills him and is awarded a partnership in Jason\'s new business venture; distribution of a synthetic chemical variant of cocaine. It turns out that Felix is working with Detective Hernández who pressures him into giving him more arrests. Felix immediately gives up Stevens, Jason, and Betty, since he views them as expendable and wants to kill Jason because of his business venture. Carver knows about the upcoming bust, but refuses to interfere forcing Stevens to violate orders and stop it himself. At the deal, Stevens exposes Felix as a police informant, which results in a vengeful Jason killing him.\nGallegos comes to personally meet with Jason and Stevens and informs them that they have inherited Felix\'s $1.8 million debt. Later that same day, Stevens meets with Carver to tell him about his meeting with Gallegos. Instead Carver pulls a gun on Stevens and orders him to surrender his weapon and get in his car. Angrily Stevens disarms Carver and forces him to reveal what\'s happening behind the scenes. Carver admits that the State Department is leaving Gallegos and Guzman alone because Guzman may someday be useful as a political asset to them. Stevens\' disillusionment reaches its conclusion and he abandons his undercover status vowing to take down Gallegos and Guzman alone.\nStevens and Jason learn that Gallegos is going to kill them anyway, so instead of paying Gallegos, Jason and Stevens cleverly kill him and steal a van storing over a $100 million of Gallegos\' cash. Jason and Stevens invite Guzman to a shipyard and offer to return 80% of Gallegos\' money if he agrees to invest the remaining 20% in their synthetic cocaine distribution operation. Detective Taft, who has been tailing Stevens, interrupts the deal but is unable to arrest Guzman because of his diplomatic status. Guzman flees the scene before Taft\'s backup arrives. Taft orders Stevens to surrender, but is shot and wounded by Jason. Stevens reveals to Jason that he is a police officer but Jason ignores this information and cajoles him into joining Jason and abandoning the dying Taft. Jason kills Taft, despite Stevens\' pleas to let him go. Stevens then reaffirms himself as a police officer and attempts to arrest Jason, but is forced to kill him when Jason draws his gun.\nAfterwards, Carver leverages Stevens by threatening to charge Betty with several bank fraud violations. In exchange for his favorable testimony of Carver, the DEA, and their sting operation, Stevens can prevent Betty\'s prosecution. Stevens agrees, but during his testimony to the House Judiciary Subcommittee, he produces a video tape of the incriminating conversation with Guzman at the shipyard, thus potentially ruining Guzman\'s and Carver´s career. Later he contemplates what to do with the $11 million of Gallegos\' money that he secretly kept.', 'tokens': array(['In', 'Cleveland', ',', '1972', ',', 'Russell', 'Stevens', 'Jr.',

The sound \n               reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. \n               Tears run from Elias\'s eyes, blood from his mouth, but he \n               doesn\'t move.\n\n<b>                                     GOPHER\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         Three.\n\n<b>                                     A VOICE\n</b>                         Felix!

Through a one-\n               way window they see:\n\n<b>               BETTY\n</b>\n               alone in the cell, unaware she\'s being watched.\n\n<b>                                     CARVER\n</b>                         Go back to work, she walks out of \n                         here.

Carver shrugs apologetically.\n\n<b>               INT. ANOTHER ROOM\n</b>\n               Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. \n               The only deviation is Hull in prison blues.\n\n               The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She \n               sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they\'re being \n               watched.\n\n<b>                                     MCCUTCHEON\n</b>                         They want me to testify against you. \n                         I said I wouldn\'t.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                         You have to. It\'s all set up. That\'s \n                         how you\'re getting off.\n\n               She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult \n               it is to get back to an honorable life.\n\n               He takes her hand.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing; with \n                              difficulty)\n                         My father didn\'t have a heart attack.\n\n               She looks at him.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         He was shot robbing a liquor store. \n                         Trying to rob it.

Hull extracts \n               himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of \n               tissue in the iris, blocking our view.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Taft\'s wife and children (from the wallet photo) \n               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.\n\n               When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his \n               pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father \n               gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that \n               already cover the plot.\n\n               He\'s silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who\'s \n               standing with Hull\'s children. The kids each take his hand, \n               they walk together.\n\n<b>                                     CARVER\n</b>                         Betty walked out of court free this \n                         morning.

He likes a good joke. Hull \n               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         The nigger\'s the one who\'d even think \n                         about doing what you tell him.\n\n               He walks away.

This book follows Anne from the age of 16 to 18, during the two years that she teaches at Avonlea school. It includes many of the characters from Anne of Green Gables, as well as new ones like Mr. Harrison, Miss Lavendar Lewis, Paul Irving, and the twins Dora and Davy.Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School. The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbor, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora. They are the children of Marilla's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country. Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Davy is Dora's exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly, of course) to know the twins will remain with them.\nOther characters introduced are some of Anne's new pupils, such as Paul Irving, an American boy living with his grandmother in Avonlea while his widower father works in the States. He delights Anne with his imagination and whimsical ways, which are reminiscent of Anne's in her childhood. Later in the book, Anne and her friends meet Miss Lavendar Lewis, a sweet but lonely lady in her 40s who had been engaged to Paul's father 25 years before, but parted from him after a disagreement. At the end of the book, Mr. Irving returns and he and Miss Lavendar marry.\nAnne discovers the delights and troubles of being a teacher, takes part in the raising of Davy and Dora, and organizes the A.V.I.S. (Avonlea Village Improvement Society) together with Gilbert, Diana, and Fred Wright, though their efforts to improve the town are not always successful. The Society takes up a subscription to repaint an old town hall, only to have the painter provide the wrong color of paint, turning the hall into a bright blue eyesore.\nTowards the end of the book, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's husband dies and Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla at Green Gables, allowing Anne to go to college at last. She and Gilbert make plans to attend Redmond College in the fall.\nThis book sees Anne maturing slightly, even though she still cannot avoid getting into a number of her familiar scrapes, as only Anne canâ\x80\x94some of which include selling her neighbor's cow (having mistaken it for her own), or getting stuck in a broken duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window."", 'tokens': array(['Following', 'Anne', 'of', 'Green', 'Gables', '(', '1908', ')',

A. Harrison\'s house\nlike a great white mountain, was far away in a delicious world where a\ncertain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work, shaping the destinies\nof future statesmen, and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high\nand lofty ambitions.\n\nTo be sure, if you came down to harsh facts . . . which, it must be\nconfessed, Anne seldom did until she had to . . . it did not seem likely\nthat there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea\nschool; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used\nher influence for good. Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a\nteacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it; and\nshe was in the midst of a delightful scene, forty years hence, with a\nfamous personage . . . just exactly what he was to be famous for was left\nin convenient haziness, but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have\nhim a college president or a Canadian premier . . . bowing low over her\nwrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his\nambition, and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she\nhad instilled so long ago in Avonlea school. This pleasant vision was\nshattered by a most unpleasant interruption.\n\nA demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds\nlater Mr. Harrison arrived . . . if ""arrived"" be not too mild a term to\ndescribe the manner of his irruption into the yard.\n\nHe bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate, and angrily\nconfronted astonished Anne, who had risen to her feet and stood looking\nat him in some bewilderment. Mr. Harrison was their new righthand\nneighbor and she had never met him before, although she had seen him\nonce or twice.\n\nIn early April, before Anne had come home from Queen\'s, Mr. Robert Bell,\nwhose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west, had sold out and\nmoved to Charlottetown. His farm had been bought by a certain Mr. J. A.\nHarrison, whose name, and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man, were\nall that was known about him. But before he had been a month in Avonlea\nhe had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . ""a crank,"" Mrs.\nRachel Lynde said. Mrs. Rachel was an outspoken lady, as those of you\nwho may have already made her acquaintance will remember. Mr. Harrison\nwas certainly different from other people . . . and that is the essential\ncharacteristic of a crank, as everybody knows.\n\nIn the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated\nthat he wanted no fools of women around his diggings. Feminine\nAvonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his\nhouse-keeping and cooking. He had hired little John Henry Carter of\nWhite Sands and John Henry started the stories. For one thing, there\nwas never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment. Mr.\nHarrison ""got a bite"" when he felt hungry, and if John Henry were around\nat the time, he came in for a share, but if he were not, he had to wait\nuntil Mr. Harrison\'s next hungry spell. John Henry mournfully averred\nthat he would have starved to death if it wasn\'t that he got home on\nSundays and got a good filling up, and that his mother always gave him a\nbasket of ""grub"" to take back with him on Monday mornings.\n\nAs for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it\nunless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at\nonce in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.\n\nAgain, Mr. Harrison was ""close."" When he was asked to subscribe to the\nRev. Mr. Allan\'s salary he said he\'d wait and see how many dollars\'\nworth of good he got out of his preaching first . . . he didn\'t believe\nin buying a pig in a poke. And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a\ncontribution to missions . . . and incidentally to see the inside of\nthe house . . . he told her there were more heathens among the old woman\ngossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of, and he\'d cheerfully\ncontribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she\'d undertake it.\nMrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert\nBell was safe in her grave, for it would have broken her heart to see\nthe state of her house in which she used to take so much pride.\n\n""Why, she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day,"" Mrs. Lynde told\nMarilla Cuthbert indignantly, ""and if you could see it now! I had to\nhold up my skirts as I walked across it.""\n\nFinally, Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger. Nobody in Avonlea had\never kept a parrot before; consequently that proceeding was considered\nbarely respectable. And such a parrot! If you took John Henry Carter\'s\nword for it, never was such an unholy bird. It swore terribly. Mrs.\nCarter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure\nshe could get another place for him. Besides, Ginger had bitten a piece\nright out of the back of John Henry\'s neck one day when he had stooped\ndown too near the cage. Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the\nluckless John Henry went home on Sundays.\n\nAll these things flashed through Anne\'s mind as Mr. Harrison stood,\nquite speechless with wrath apparently, before her. In his most amiable\nmood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was\nshort and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage\nand his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne\nthought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.\n\nAll at once Mr. Harrison found his voice.\n\n""I\'m not going to put up with this,"" he spluttered, ""not a day longer,\ndo you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss . . .  the\nthird time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss. I warned your aunt\nthe last time not to let it occur again . . .  and she\'s let it . . . she\'s\ndone it . . . what does she mean by it, that is what I want to know. That\nis what I\'m here about, miss.""\n\n""Will you explain what the trouble is?"" asked Anne, in her most\ndignified manner. She had been practicing it considerably of late to\nhave it in good working order when school began; but it had no apparent\neffect on the irate J. A. Harrison.\n\n""Trouble, is it? Bless my soul, trouble enough, I should think. The\ntrouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt\'s in my oats\nagain, not half an hour ago. The third time, mark you. I found her in\nlast Tuesday and I found her in yesterday. I came here and told your\naunt not to let it occur again. She has let it occur again. Where\'s your\naunt, miss? I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of\nmy mind . . . a piece of J. A. Harrison\'s mind, miss.""\n\n""If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert, she is not my aunt, and she has gone\ndown to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill,""\nsaid Anne, with due increase of dignity at every word. ""I am very sorry\nthat my cow should have broken into your oats . . .  she is my cow and not\nMiss Cuthbert\'s . . . Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was\na little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell.""\n\n""Sorry, miss! Sorry isn\'t going to help matters any. You\'d better go and\nlook at the havoc that animal has made in my oats . . . trampled them from\ncenter to circumference, miss.""\n\n""I am very sorry,"" repeated Anne firmly, ""but perhaps if you kept your\nfences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part\nof the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I\nnoticed the other day that it was not in very good condition.""\n\n""My fence is all right,"" snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever at this\ncarrying of the war into the enemy\'s country. ""The jail fence couldn\'t\nkeep a demon of a cow like that out. And I can tell you, you redheaded\nsnippet, that if the cow is yours, as you say, you\'d be better employed\nin watching her out of other people\'s grain than in sitting round\nreading yellow-covered novels,"" . . . with a scathing glance at the\ninnocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne\'s feet.\n\nSomething at that moment was red besides Anne\'s hair . . . which had\nalways been a tender point with her.\n\n""I\'d rather have red hair than none at all, except a little fringe round\nmy ears,"" she flashed.\n\nThe shot told, for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald\nhead. His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly\nat Anne, who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage.\n\n""I can make allowance for you, Mr. Harrison, because I have an\nimagination. I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a\ncow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you\nfor the things you\'ve said. I promise you that Dolly shall never break\ninto your oats again. I give you my word of honor on THAT point.""\n\n""Well, mind you she doesn\'t,"" muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat\nsubdued tone; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him\ngrowling to himself until he was out of earshot.\n\nGrievously disturbed in mind, Anne marched across the yard and shut the\nnaughty Jersey up in the milking pen.\n\n""She can\'t possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down,""\nshe reflected. ""She looks pretty quiet now. I daresay she has sickened\nherself on those oats. I wish I\'d sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted\nher last week, but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had\nthe auction of the stock and let them all go together. I believe it is\ntrue about Mr. Harrison being a crank. Certainly there\'s nothing of the\nkindred spirit about HIM.""\n\nAnne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits.\n\nMarilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the\nhouse, and the latter flew to get tea ready. They discussed the matter\nat the tea table.\n\n""I\'ll be glad when the auction is over,"" said Marilla. ""It is too much\nresponsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that\nunreliable Martin to look after them. He has never come back yet and he\npromised that he would certainly be back last night if I\'d give him the\nday off to go to his aunt\'s funeral. I don\'t know how many aunts he has\ngot, I am sure. That\'s the fourth that\'s died since he hired here a year\nago. I\'ll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes\nover the farm. We\'ll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin\ncomes, for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have\nto be fixed. I declare, it is a world of trouble, as Rachel says. Here\'s\npoor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of\nhers is more than I know. She has a brother in British Columbia and she\nhas written to him about them, but she hasn\'t heard from him yet.""\n\n""What are the children like? How old are they?""\n\n""Six past . . . they\'re twins.""\n\n""Oh, I\'ve always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs.\nHammond had so many,"" said Anne eagerly. ""Are they pretty?""\n\n""Goodness, you couldn\'t tell . . . they were too dirty. Davy had been\nout making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in. Davy pushed her\nheadfirst into the biggest pie and then, because she cried, he got into\nit himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about.\nMary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of\nmischief. He has never had any bringing up you might say. His father\ndied when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since.""\n\n""I\'m always sorry for children that have no bringing up,"" said Anne\nsoberly. ""You know _I_ hadn\'t any till you took me in hand. I hope their\nuncle will look after them. Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you?""\n\n""Mary? None in the world. It was her husband . . . he was our third\ncousin. There\'s Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard. I thought she\'d be\nup to hear about Mary.""\n\n""Don\'t tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow,"" implored Anne.\n\nMarilla promised; but the promise was quite unnecessary, for Mrs. Lynde\nwas no sooner fairly seated than she said,\n\n""I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was\ncoming home from Carmody. I thought he looked pretty mad. Did he make\nmuch of a rumpus?""\n\nAnne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles. Few things in\nAvonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde. It was only that morning Anne had said,\n\n""If you went to your own room at midnight, locked the door, pulled down\nthe blind, and SNEEZED, Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your\ncold was!""\n\n""I believe he did,"" admitted Marilla. ""I was away. He gave Anne a piece\nof his mind.""\n\n""I think he is a very disagreeable man,"" said Anne, with a resentful\ntoss of her ruddy head.\n\n""You never said a truer word,"" said Mrs. Rachel solemnly. ""I knew\nthere\'d be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick\nman, that\'s what. I don\'t know what Avonlea is coming to, with so many\nstrange people rushing into it. It\'ll soon not be safe to go to sleep in\nour beds.""\n\n""Why, what other strangers are coming in?"" asked Marilla.\n\n""Haven\'t you heard? Well, there\'s a family of Donnells, for one thing.\nThey\'ve rented Peter Sloane\'s old house. Peter has hired the man to run\nhis mill. They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them.\nThen that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from\nWhite Sands and they\'ll simply be a burden on the public. He is\nin consumption . . . when he isn\'t stealing . . .  and his wife is a\nslack-twisted creature that can\'t turn her hand to a thing. She washes\nher dishes SITTING DOWN. Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband\'s orphan\nnephew, Anthony Pye. He\'ll be going to school to you, Anne, so you may\nexpect trouble, that\'s what. And you\'ll have another strange pupil, too.\nPaul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother.\nYou remember his father, Marilla . . . Stephen Irving, him that jilted\nLavendar Lewis over at Grafton?""\n\n""I don\'t think he jilted her. There was a quarrel . . . I suppose there\nwas blame on both sides.""\n\n""Well, anyway, he didn\'t marry her, and she\'s been as queer as possible\never since, they say . . . living all by herself in that little stone\nhouse she calls Echo Lodge. Stephen went off to the States and went\ninto business with his uncle and married a Yankee. He\'s never been home\nsince, though his mother has been up to see him once or twice. His wife\ndied two years ago and he\'s sending the boy home to his mother for a\nspell. He\'s ten years old and I don\'t know if he\'ll be a very desirable\npupil. You can never tell about those Yankees.""\n\nMrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born\nor brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided\ncan-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air. They MIGHT be good people,\nof course; but you were on the safe side in doubting it. She had a\nspecial prejudice against ""Yankees."" Her husband had been cheated out\nof ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and\nneither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs.\nRachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it.\n\n""Avonlea school won\'t be the worse for a little new blood,"" said Marilla\ndrily, ""and if this boy is anything like his father he\'ll be all right.\nSteve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts,\nthough some people did call him proud. I should think Mrs. Irving would\nbe very glad to have the child. She has been very lonesome since her\nhusband died.""\n\n""Oh, the boy may be well enough, but he\'ll be different from Avonlea\nchildren,"" said Mrs. Rachel, as if that clinched the matter. Mrs.\nRachel\'s opinions concerning any person, place, or thing, were always\nwarranted to wear. ""What\'s this I hear about your going to start up a\nVillage Improvement Society, Anne?""\n\n""I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last\nDebating Club,"" said Anne, flushing. ""They thought it would be rather\nnice . . . and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan. Lots of villages have them now.""\n\n""Well, you\'ll get into no end of hot water if you do. Better leave it\nalone, Anne, that\'s what. People don\'t like being improved.""\n\n""Oh, we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE. It is Avonlea\nitself. There are lots of things which might be done to make it\nprettier. For instance, if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull\ndown that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldn\'t that be an\nimprovement?""\n\n""It certainly would,"" admitted Mrs. Rachel. ""That old ruin has been an\neyesore to the settlement for years. But if you Improvers can coax\nLevi Boulter to do anything for the public that he isn\'t to be paid for\ndoing, may I be there to see and hear the process, that\'s what. I don\'t\nwant to discourage you, Anne, for there may be something in your idea,\nthough I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine;\nbut you\'ll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a\nfriend not to bother with your improvements, that\'s what. But there,\nI know you\'ll go ahead with it if you\'ve set your mind on it. You were\nalways one to carry a thing through somehow.""\n\nSomething about the firm outlines of Anne\'s lips told that Mrs. Rachel\nwas not far astray in this estimate. Anne\'s heart was bent on forming\nthe Improvement Society. Gilbert Blythe, who was to teach in White\nSands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning, was\nenthusiastic about it; and most of the other folks were willing to go in\nfor anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some ""fun.""\nAs for what the ""improvements"" were to be, nobody had any very clear\nidea except Anne and Gilbert. They had talked them over and planned them\nout until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds, if nowhere else.\n\nMrs. Rachel had still another item of news.\n\n""They\'ve given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant. Didn\'t you go to\nQueen\'s with a girl of that name, Anne?""\n\n""Yes, indeed. Priscilla to teach at Carmody! How perfectly lovely!""\nexclaimed Anne, her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening\nstars, causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it\nsettled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty\ngirl or not.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nSelling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure\n\n\nAnne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon\nand took Diana Barry with her. Diana was, of course, a pledged member of\nthe Improvement Society, and the two girls talked about little else all\nthe way to Carmody and back.\n\n""The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that\nhall painted,"" said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall, a rather\nshabby building set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees hooding\nit about on all sides. ""It\'s a disgraceful looking place and we must\nattend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his\nhouse down. Father says we\'ll never succeed in DOING that. Levi Boulter\nis too mean to spend the time it would take.""\n\n""Perhaps he\'ll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul\nthe boards and split them up for him for kindling wood,"" said Anne\nhopefully. ""We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first.\nWe can\'t expect to improve everything all at once. We\'ll have to educate\npublic sentiment first, of course.""\n\nDiana wasn\'t exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant; but it\nsounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a\nsociety with such an aim in view.\n\n""I thought of something last night that we could do, Anne. You know\nthat three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and\nNewbridge and White Sands meet? It\'s all grown over with young spruce;\nbut wouldn\'t it be nice to have them all cleared out, and just leave the\ntwo or three birch trees that are on it?""\n\n""Splendid,"" agreed Anne gaily. ""And have a rustic seat put under the\nbirches. And when spring comes we\'ll have a flower-bed made in the\nmiddle of it and plant geraniums.""\n\n""Yes; only we\'ll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram\nSloane to keep her cow off the road, or she\'ll eat our geraniums\nup,"" laughed Diana. ""I begin to see what you mean by educating public\nsentiment, Anne. There\'s the old Boulter house now. Did you ever see\nsuch a rookery? And perched right close to the road too. An old house\nwith its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its\neyes picked out.""\n\n""I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight,"" said Anne\ndreamily. ""It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and\nmourning for its old-time joys. Marilla says that a large family was\nraised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real pretty place,\nwith a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it. It was full of\nlittle children and laughter and songs; and now it is empty, and nothing\never wanders through it but the wind. How lonely and sorrowful it must\nfeel! Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights . . . the ghosts of the\nlittle children of long ago and the roses and the songs . . . and for a\nlittle while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again.""\n\nDiana shook her head.\n\n""I never imagine things like that about places now, Anne. Don\'t you\nremember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into\nthe Haunted Wood? To this day I can\'t go through that bush comfortably\nafter dark; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter\nhouse I\'d be frightened to pass it too. Besides, those children aren\'t\ndead. They\'re all grown up and doing well . . . and one of them is a\nbutcher. And flowers and songs couldn\'t have ghosts anyhow.""\n\nAnne smothered a little sigh. She loved Diana dearly and they had always\nbeen good comrades. But she had long ago learned that when she wandered\ninto the realm of fancy she must go alone. The way to it was by an\nenchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her.\n\nA thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody; it did\nnot last long, however, and the drive home, through lanes where the\nraindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the\ndrenched ferns gave out spicy odors, was delightful. But just as they\nturned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty\nof the landscape for her.\n\nBefore them on the right extended Mr. Harrison\'s broad, gray-green field\nof late oats, wet and luxuriant; and there, standing squarely in the\nmiddle of it, up to her sleek sides in the lush growth, and blinking at\nthem calmly over the intervening tassels, was a Jersey cow!\n\nAnne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that\nboded no good to the predatory quadruped. Not a word said she, but she\nclimbed nimbly down over the wheels, and whisked across the fence before\nDiana understood what had happened.\n\n""Anne, come back,"" shrieked the latter, as soon as she found her voice.\n""You\'ll ruin your dress in that wet grain . . . ruin it. She doesn\'t hear\nme! Well, she\'ll never get that cow out by herself. I must go and help\nher, of course.""\n\nAnne was charging through the grain like a mad thing. Diana hopped\nbriskly down, tied the horse securely to a post, turned the skirt of her\npretty gingham dress over her shoulders, mounted the fence, and started\nin pursuit of her frantic friend. She could run faster than Anne, who\nwas hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt, and soon overtook her.\nBehind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison\'s heart when\nhe should see it.\n\n""Anne, for mercy\'s sake, stop,"" panted poor Diana. ""I\'m right out of\nbreath and you are wet to the skin.""\n\n""I must . . . get . . . that cow . . . out . . . before . . . Mr.\nHarrison . . . sees her,"" gasped Anne. ""I don\'t . . . care . . . if I\'m\n. . . drowned . . . if we . . . can . . . only . . . do that.""\n\nBut the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out\nof her luscious browsing ground. No sooner had the two breathless girls\ngot near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner\nof the field.\n\n""Head her off,"" screamed Anne. ""Run, Diana, run.""\n\nDiana did run. Anne tried to, and the wicked Jersey went around the\nfield as if she were possessed. Privately, Diana thought she was. It was\nfully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the\ncorner gap into the Cuthbert lane.\n\nThere is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper\nat that precise moment. Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a\nbuggy halted just outside the lane, wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody\nand his son, both of whom wore a broad smile.\n\n""I guess you\'d better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her\nlast week, Anne,"" chuckled Mr. Shearer.\n\n""I\'ll sell her to you now, if you want her,"" said her flushed and\ndisheveled owner. ""You may have her this very minute.""\n\n""Done. I\'ll give you twenty for her as I offered before, and Jim here\ncan drive her right over to Carmody. She\'ll go to town with the rest of\nthe shipment this evening. Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow.""\n\nFive minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the\nroad, and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with\nher twenty dollars.\n\n""What will Marilla say?"" asked Diana.\n\n""Oh, she won\'t care. Dolly was my own cow and it isn\'t likely she\'d\nbring more than twenty dollars at the auction. But oh dear, if Mr.\nHarrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again, and after\nmy giving him my word of honor that I\'d never let it happen! Well, it\nhas taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows. A cow\nthat could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence couldn\'t be\ntrusted anywhere.""\n\nMarilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde\'s, and when she returned knew all\nabout Dolly\'s sale and transfer, for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the\ntransaction from her window and guessed the rest.\n\n""I suppose it\'s just as well she\'s gone, though you DO do things in a\ndreadful headlong fashion, Anne. I don\'t see how she got out of the pen,\nthough. She must have broken some of the boards off.""\n\n""I didn\'t think of looking,"" said Anne, ""but I\'ll go and see now. Martin\nhas never come back yet. Perhaps some more of his aunts have died. I\nthink it\'s something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians. The\nother evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr.\nSloane, \'I see here that another octogenarian has just died. What is an\noctogenarian, Peter?\' And Mr. Sloane said he didn\'t know, but they must\nbe very sickly creatures, for you never heard tell of them but they were\ndying. That\'s the way with Martin\'s aunts.""\n\n""Martin\'s just like all the rest of those French,"" said Marilla in\ndisgust. ""You can\'t depend on them for a day."" Marilla was looking over\nAnne\'s Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard.\nA minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen, wringing her hands.\n\n""Anne Shirley, what\'s the matter now?""\n\n""Oh, Marilla, whatever shall I do? This is terrible. And it\'s all my\nfault. Oh, will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing\nreckless things? Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful\nsome day, and now I\'ve done it!""\n\n""Anne, you are the most exasperating girl! WHAT is it you\'ve done?""\n\n""Sold Mr. Harrison\'s Jersey cow . . . the one he bought from Mr. Bell\n. . . to Mr. Shearer! Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute.""\n\n""Anne Shirley, are you dreaming?""\n\n""I only wish I were. There\'s no dream about it, though it\'s very like a\nnightmare. And Mr. Harrison\'s cow is in Charlottetown by this time. Oh,\nMarilla, I thought I\'d finished getting into scrapes, and here I am in\nthe very worst one I ever was in in my life. What can I do?""\n\n""Do? There\'s nothing to do, child, except go and see Mr. Harrison about\nit. We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he doesn\'t want to take\nthe money. She is just as good as his.""\n\n""I\'m sure he\'ll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it, though,""\nmoaned Anne.\n\n""I daresay he will. He seems to be an irritable sort of a man. I\'ll go\nand explain to him if you like.""\n\n""No, indeed, I\'m not as mean as that,"" exclaimed Anne. ""This is all my\nfault and I\'m certainly not going to let you take my punishment. I\'ll go\nmyself and I\'ll go at once. The sooner it\'s over the better, for it will\nbe terribly humiliating.""\n\nPoor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when\nshe happened to glance through the open pantry door. On the table\nreposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning . . . a particularly\ntoothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts. Anne\nhad intended it for Friday evening, when the youth of Avonlea were to\nmeet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society. But what were\nthey compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison? Anne thought that\ncake ought to soften the heart of any man, especially one who had to do\nhis own cooking, and she promptly popped it into a box. She would take\nit to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering.\n\n""That is, if he gives me a chance to say anything at all,"" she thought\nruefully, as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut\nacross the fields, golden in the light of the dreamy August evening. ""I\nknow now just how people feel who are being led to execution.""\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nMr. Harrison at Home\n\n\nMr. Harrison\'s house was an old-fashioned, low-eaved, whitewashed\nstructure, set against a thick spruce grove.\n\nMr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda, in his shirt\nsleeves, enjoying his evening pipe. When he realized who was coming up\nthe path he sprang suddenly to his feet, bolted into the house, and\nshut the door. This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise,\nmingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day\nbefore. But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne\'s\nheart.\n\n""If he\'s so cross now what will he be when he hears what I\'ve done,"" she\nreflected miserably, as she rapped at the door.\n\nBut Mr. Harrison opened it, smiling sheepishly, and invited her to enter\nin a tone quite mild and friendly, if somewhat nervous. He had laid\naside his pipe and donned his coat; he offered Anne a very dusty chair\nvery politely, and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough\nif it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through\nthe bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes. No sooner had Anne seated\nherself than Ginger exclaimed,\n\n""Bless my soul, what\'s that redheaded snippet coming here for?""\n\nIt would be hard to say whose face was the redder, Mr. Harrison\'s or\nAnne\'s.\n\n""Don\'t you mind that parrot,"" said Mr. Harrison, casting a furious\nglance at Ginger. ""He\'s . . . he\'s always talking nonsense. I got him\nfrom my brother who was a sailor. Sailors don\'t always use the choicest\nlanguage, and parrots are very imitative birds.""\n\n""So I should think,"" said poor Anne, the remembrance of her errand\nquelling her resentment. She couldn\'t afford to snub Mr. Harrison under\nthe circumstances, that was certain. When you had just sold a man\'s\nJersey cow offhand, without his knowledge or consent you must not\nmind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things. Nevertheless, the\n""redheaded snippet"" was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have\nbeen.\n\n""I\'ve come to confess something to you, Mr. Harrison,"" she said\nresolutely. ""It\'s . . . it\'s about . . . that Jersey cow.""\n\n""Bless my soul,"" exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously, ""has she gone and\nbroken into my oats again? Well, never mind . . . never mind if she has.\nIt\'s no difference . . . none at all, I . . . I was too hasty yesterday,\nthat\'s a fact. Never mind if she has.""\n\n""Oh, if it were only that,"" sighed Anne. ""But it\'s ten times worse. I\ndon\'t . . .""\n\n""Bless my soul, do you mean to say she\'s got into my wheat?""\n\n""No . . . no . . . not the wheat. But . . .""\n\n""Then it\'s the cabbages! She\'s broken into my cabbages that I was\nraising for Exhibition, hey?""\n\n""It\'s NOT the cabbages, Mr. Harrison. I\'ll tell you everything . . .\nthat is what I came for--but please don\'t interrupt me. It makes me so\nnervous. Just let me tell my story and don\'t say anything till I get\nthrough--and then no doubt you\'ll say plenty,"" Anne concluded, but in\nthought only.\n\n""I won\'t say another word,"" said Mr. Harrison, and he didn\'t. But\nGinger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating,\n""Redheaded snippet"" at intervals until Anne felt quite wild.\n\n""I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday. This morning I went to\nCarmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats. Diana and\nI chased her out and you can\'t imagine what a hard time we had. I was\nso dreadfully wet and tired and vexed--and Mr. Shearer came by that very\nminute and offered to buy the cow. I sold her to him on the spot for\ntwenty dollars. It was wrong of me. I should have waited and consulted\nMarilla, of course. But I\'m dreadfully given to doing things without\nthinking--everybody who knows me will tell you that. Mr. Shearer took\nthe cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train.""\n\n""Redheaded snippet,"" quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt.\n\nAt this point Mr. Harrison arose and, with an expression that would have\nstruck terror into any bird but a parrot, carried Ginger\'s cage into an\nadjoining room and shut the door. Ginger shrieked, swore, and otherwise\nconducted himself in keeping with his reputation, but finding himself\nleft alone, relapsed into sulky silence.\n\n""Excuse me and go on,"" said Mr. Harrison, sitting down again. ""My\nbrother the sailor never taught that bird any manners.""\n\n""I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen. Mr.\nHarrison,"" . . . Anne leaned forward, clasping her hands with her old\nchildish gesture, while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr.\nHarrison\'s embarrassed face . . . ""I found my cow still shut up in the\npen. It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer.""\n\n""Bless my soul,"" exclaimed Mr. Harrison, in blank amazement at this\nunlooked-for conclusion. ""What a VERY extraordinary thing!""\n\n""Oh, it isn\'t in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself\nand other people into scrapes,"" said Anne mournfully. ""I\'m noted for\nthat. You might suppose I\'d have grown out of it by this time . . . I\'ll\nbe seventeen next March . . . but it seems that I haven\'t. Mr. Harrison,\nis it too much to hope that you\'ll forgive me? I\'m afraid it\'s too late\nto get your cow back, but here is the money for her . . . or you can have\nmine in exchange if you\'d rather. She\'s a very good cow. And I can\'t\nexpress how sorry I am for it all.""\n\n""Tut, tut,"" said Mr. Harrison briskly, ""don\'t say another word about it,\nmiss. It\'s of no consequence . . . no consequence whatever. Accidents will\nhappen. I\'m too hasty myself sometimes, miss . . .  far too hasty. But I\ncan\'t help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they\nfind me. If that cow had been in my cabbages now . . . but never mind, she\nwasn\'t, so it\'s all right. I think I\'d rather have your cow in exchange,\nsince you want to be rid of her.""\n\n""Oh, thank you, Mr. Harrison. I\'m so glad you are not vexed. I was\nafraid you would be.""\n\n""And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me, after\nthe fuss I made yesterday, hey? But you mustn\'t mind me, I\'m a terrible\noutspoken old fellow, that\'s all . . . awful apt to tell the truth, no\nmatter if it is a bit plain.""\n\n""So is Mrs. Lynde,"" said Anne, before she could prevent herself.\n\n""Who? Mrs. Lynde? Don\'t you tell me I\'m like that old gossip,"" said Mr.\nHarrison irritably. ""I\'m not . . . not a bit. What have you got in that\nbox?""\n\n""A cake,"" said Anne archly. In her relief at Mr. Harrison\'s unexpected\namiability her spirits soared upward feather-light. ""I brought it over\nfor you . . . I thought perhaps you didn\'t have cake very often.""\n\n""I don\'t, that\'s a fact, and I\'m mighty fond of it, too. I\'m much\nobliged to you. It looks good on top. I hope it\'s good all the way\nthrough.""\n\n""It is,"" said Anne, gaily confident. ""I have made cakes in my time that\nwere NOT, as Mrs. Allan could tell you, but this one is all right. I\nmade it for the Improvement Society, but I can make another for them.""\n\n""Well, I\'ll tell you what, miss, you must help me eat it. I\'ll put the\nkettle on and we\'ll have a cup of tea. How will that do?""\n\n""Will you let me make the tea?"" said Anne dubiously.\n\nMr. Harrison chuckled.\n\n""I see you haven\'t much confidence in my ability to make tea. You\'re\nwrong . . . I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank. But go\nahead yourself. Fortunately it rained last Sunday, so there\'s plenty of\nclean dishes.""\n\nAnne hopped briskly up and went to work. She washed the teapot in\nseveral waters before she put the tea to steep. Then she swept the stove\nand set the table, bringing the dishes out of the pantry. The state of\nthat pantry horrified Anne, but she wisely said nothing. Mr. Harrison\ntold her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches. Anne\nadorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to\nthe stains on the tablecloth. Soon the tea was ready and Anne found\nherself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table, pouring his tea\nfor him, and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and\nplans. She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses.\n\nMr. Harrison had brought Ginger back, averring that the poor bird would\nbe lonesome; and Anne, feeling that she could forgive everybody and\neverything, offered him a walnut. But Ginger\'s feelings had been\ngrievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship. He sat\nmoodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a\nmere ball of green and gold.\n\n""Why do you call him Ginger?"" asked Anne, who liked appropriate names\nand thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage.\n\n""My brother the sailor named him. Maybe it had some reference to his\ntemper. I think a lot of that bird though . . . you\'d be surprised if you\nknew how much. He has his faults of course. That bird has cost me a good\ndeal one way and another. Some people object to his swearing habits but\nhe can\'t be broken of them. I\'ve tried . . . other people have tried.\nSome folks have prejudices against parrots. Silly, ain\'t it? I like them\nmyself. Ginger\'s a lot of company to me. Nothing would induce me to give\nthat bird up . . . nothing in the world, miss.""\n\nMr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he\nsuspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up.\nAnne, however, was beginning to like the queer, fussy, fidgety little\nman, and before the meal was over they were quite good friends. Mr.\nHarrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to\napprove of it.\n\n""That\'s right. Go ahead. There\'s lots of room for improvement in this\nsettlement . . . and in the people too.""\n\n""Oh, I don\'t know,"" flashed Anne. To herself, or to her particular\ncronies, she might admit that there were some small imperfections,\neasily removable, in Avonlea and its inhabitants. But to hear a\npractical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different\nthing. ""I think Avonlea is a lovely place; and the people in it are very\nnice, too.""\n\n""I guess you\'ve got a spice of temper,"" commented Mr. Harrison,\nsurveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him. ""It goes\nwith hair like yours, I reckon. Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I\nwouldn\'t have located here; but I suppose even you will admit that it\nhas SOME faults?""\n\n""I like it all the better for them,"" said loyal Anne. ""I don\'t like\nplaces or people either that haven\'t any faults. I think a truly perfect\nperson would be very uninteresting. Mrs. Milton White says she never met\na perfect person, but she\'s heard enough about one  . . . her husband\'s\nfirst wife. Don\'t you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married\nto a man whose first wife was perfect?""\n\n""It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife,""\ndeclared Mr. Harrison, with a sudden and inexplicable warmth.\n\nWhen tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes, although Mr.\nHarrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks\nyet. She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also, but no broom\nwas visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there\nwasn\'t one at all.\n\n""You might run across and talk to me once in a while,"" suggested Mr.\nHarrison when she was leaving. ""\'Tisn\'t far and folks ought to be\nneighborly. I\'m kind of interested in that society of yours. Seems to me\nthere\'ll be some fun in it. Who are you going to tackle first?""\n\n""We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE . . . it is only PLACES we mean to\nimprove,"" said Anne, in a dignified tone. She rather suspected that Mr.\nHarrison was making fun of the project.\n\nWhen she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window . . . a lithe,\ngirlish shape, tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset\nafterglow.\n\n""I\'m a crusty, lonesome, crabbed old chap,"" he said aloud, ""but there\'s\nsomething about that little girl makes me feel young again . . . and it\'s\nsuch a pleasant sensation I\'d like to have it repeated once in a while.""\n\n""Redheaded snippet,"" croaked Ginger mockingly.\n\nMr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot.\n\n""You ornery bird,"" he muttered, ""I almost wish I\'d wrung your neck when\nmy brother the sailor brought you home. Will you never be done getting\nme into trouble?""\n\nAnne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla, who had\nbeen not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of\nstarting out to look for her.\n\n""It\'s a pretty good world, after all, isn\'t it, Marilla?"" concluded Anne\nhappily. ""Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it wasn\'t much\nof a world. She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant\nyou were sure to be more or less disappointed  . . . perhaps that is true.\nBut there is a good side to it too. The bad things don\'t always come\nup to your expectations either  . . . they nearly always turn out ever so\nmuch better than you think. I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant\nexperience when I went over to Mr. Harrison\'s tonight; and instead he\nwas quite kind and I had almost a nice time. I think we\'re going to be\nreal good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other, and\neverything has turned out for the best. But all the same, Marilla, I\nshall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she\nbelongs. And I do NOT like parrots!""\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nDifferent Opinions\n\n\nOne evening at sunset, Jane Andrews, Gilbert Blythe, and Anne Shirley\nwere lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs,\nwhere a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road. Jane had\nbeen up to spend the afternoon with Anne, who walked part of the way\nhome with her; at the fence they met Gilbert, and all three were now\ntalking about the fateful morrow; for that morrow was the first of\nSeptember and the schools would open. Jane would go to Newbridge and\nGilbert to White Sands.\n\n""You both have the advantage of me,"" sighed Anne. ""You\'re going to teach\nchildren who don\'t know you, but I have to teach my own old schoolmates,\nand Mrs. Lynde says she\'s afraid they won\'t respect me as they would\na stranger unless I\'m very cross from the first. But I don\'t believe a\nteacher should be cross. Oh, it seems to me such a responsibility!""\n\n""I guess we\'ll get on all right,"" said Jane comfortably. Jane was not\ntroubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good. She meant to\nearn her salary fairly, please the trustees, and get her name on the\nSchool Inspector\'s roll of honor. Further ambitions Jane had none. ""The\nmain thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross\nto do that. If my pupils won\'t do as I tell them I shall punish them.""\n\n""How?""\n\n""Give them a good whipping, of course.""\n\n""Oh, Jane, you wouldn\'t,"" cried Anne, shocked. ""Jane, you COULDN\'T!""\n\n""Indeed, I could and would, if they deserved it,"" said Jane decidedly.\n\n""I could NEVER whip a child,"" said Anne with equal decision. ""I don\'t\nbelieve in it AT ALL. Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had\nperfect order; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order\nat all. No, if I can\'t get along without whipping I shall not try to\nteach school. There are better ways of managing. I shall try to win my\npupils\' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them.""\n\n""But suppose they don\'t?"" said practical Jane.\n\n""I wouldn\'t whip them anyhow. I\'m sure it wouldn\'t do any good. Oh,\ndon\'t whip your pupils, Jane dear, no matter what they do.""\n\n""What do you think about it, Gilbert?"" demanded Jane. ""Don\'t you think\nthere are some children who really need a whipping now and then?""\n\n""Don\'t you think it\'s a cruel, barbarous thing to whip a child . . .  ANY\nchild?"" exclaimed Anne, her face flushing with earnestness.\n\n""Well,"" said Gilbert slowly, torn between his real convictions and his\nwish to measure up to Anne\'s ideal, ""there\'s something to be said on\nboth sides. I don\'t believe in whipping children MUCH. I think, as you\nsay, Anne, that there are better ways of managing as a rule, and that\ncorporal punishment should be a last resort. But on the other hand,\nas Jane says, I believe there is an occasional child who can\'t be\ninfluenced in any other way and who, in short, needs a whipping and\nwould be improved by it. Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be\nmy rule.""\n\nGilbert, having tried to please both sides, succeeded, as is usual and\neminently right, in pleasing neither. Jane tossed her head.\n\n""I\'ll whip my pupils when they\'re naughty. It\'s the shortest and easiest\nway of convincing them.""\n\nAnne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance.\n\n""I shall never whip a child,"" she repeated firmly. ""I feel sure it isn\'t\neither right or necessary.""\n\n""Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?"" said\nJane.\n\n""I\'d keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him,"" said\nAnne. ""There is some good in every person if you can find it. It is\na teacher\'s duty to find and develop it. That is what our School\nManagement professor at Queen\'s told us, you know. Do you suppose you\ncould find any good in a child by whipping him? It\'s far more important\nto influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three\nR\'s, Professor Rennie says.""\n\n""But the Inspector examines them in the three R\'s, mind you, and he\nwon\'t give you a good report if they don\'t come up to his standard,""\nprotested Jane.\n\n""I\'d rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as\na real helper than be on the roll of honor,"" asserted Anne decidedly.\n\n""Wouldn\'t you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?"" asked\nGilbert.\n\n""Oh, yes, I suppose I shall have to, although I know I\'ll hate to do it.\nBut you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give\nthem lines to write.""\n\n""I suppose you won\'t punish the girls by making them sit with the boys?""\nsaid Jane slyly.\n\nGilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly. Once\nupon a time, Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and\nsad and bitter had been the consequences thereof.\n\n""Well, time will tell which is the best way,"" said Jane philosophically\nas they parted.\n\nAnne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path, shadowy, rustling,\nfern-scented, through Violet Vale and past Willowmere, where dark and\nlight kissed each other under the firs, and down through Lover\'s Lane\n. . . spots she and Diana had so named long ago. She walked slowly,\nenjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight,\nand thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the\nmorrow. When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde\'s loud,\ndecided tones floated out through the open kitchen window.\n\n""Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow,"" thought\nAnne with a grimace, ""but I don\'t believe I\'ll go in. Her advice is\nmuch like pepper, I think . . . excellent in small quantities but rather\nscorching in her doses. I\'ll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison\ninstead.""\n\nThis was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr.\nHarrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow. She had been\nthere several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends,\nalthough there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness\non which he prided himself rather trying. Ginger still continued to\nregard her with suspicion, and never failed to greet her sarcastically\nas ""redheaded snippet."" Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him\nof the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and\nexclaiming,\n\n""Bless my soul, here\'s that pretty little girl again,"" or something\nequally flattering. But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it.\nAnne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind\nher back. He certainly never paid her any to her face.\n\n""Well, I suppose you\'ve been back in the woods laying in a supply of\nswitches for tomorrow?"" was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda\nsteps.\n\n""No, indeed,"" said Anne indignantly. She was an excellent target for\nteasing because she always took things so seriously. ""I shall never have\na switch in my school, Mr. Harrison. Of course, I shall have to have a\npointer, but I shall use it for pointing ONLY.""\n\n""So you mean to strap them instead? Well, I don\'t know but you\'re right.\nA switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer, that\'s a\nfact.""\n\n""I shall not use anything of the sort. I\'m not going to whip my pupils.""\n\n""Bless my soul,"" exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment, ""how do\nyou lay out to keep order then?""\n\n""I shall govern by affection, Mr. Harrison.""\n\n""It won\'t do,"" said Mr. Harrison, ""won\'t do at all, Anne. \'Spare the\nrod and spoil the child.\' When I went to school the master whipped me\nregular every day because he said if I wasn\'t in mischief just then I\nwas plotting it.""\n\n""Methods have changed since your schooldays, Mr. Harrison.""\n\n""But human nature hasn\'t. Mark my words, you\'ll never manage the young\nfry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them. The thing is impossible.""\n\n""Well, I\'m going to try my way first,"" said Anne, who had a fairly\nstrong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her\ntheories.\n\n""You\'re pretty stubborn, I reckon,"" was Mr. Harrison\'s way of putting\nit. ""Well, well, we\'ll see. Someday when you get riled up . . . and people\nwith hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled . . . you\'ll forget\nall your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling. You\'re\ntoo young to be teaching anyhow  . . . far too young and childish.""\n\nAltogether, Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood.\nShe slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning\nthat Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of\nscorching ginger tea. Anne sipped it patiently, although she could not\nimagine what good ginger tea would do. Had it been some magic brew,\npotent to confer age and experience, Anne would have swallowed a quart\nof it without flinching.\n\n""Marilla, what if I fail!""\n\n""You\'ll hardly fail completely in one day and there\'s plenty more days\ncoming,"" said Marilla. ""The trouble with you, Anne, is that you\'ll\nexpect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults\nright off, and if you can\'t you\'ll think you\'ve failed.""\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nA Full-fledged Schoolma\'am\n\n\nWhen Anne reached the school that morning . . . for the first time in her\nlife she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties . . .\nall was quiet and still. The preceding teacher had trained the\nchildren to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the\nschoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of ""shining morning faces""\nand bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils,\nhoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and\nthat they would not perceive how she was trembling.\n\nShe had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a\nspeech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had\nrevised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off\nby heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it,\nespecially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The\nonly trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it.\n\nAfter what seemed to her a year . . . about ten seconds in reality . . .\nshe said faintly, ""Take your Testaments, please,"" and sank breathlessly\ninto her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that\nfollowed. While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky\nwits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the\nGrownup Land.\n\nMost of them were, of course, quite well known to her. Her own\nclassmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all\ngone to school with her, excepting the primer class and ten newcomers\nto Avonlea. Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those\nwhose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her. To be\nsure, they might be just as commonplace as the rest; but on the other\nhand there MIGHT be a genius among them. It was a thrilling idea.\n\nSitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye. He had a dark,\nsullen little face, and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in\nhis black eyes. Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that\nboy\'s affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly.\n\nIn the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane. . .\na jolly looking little chap, with a snub nose, freckled face, and big,\nlight blue eyes, fringed with whitish lashes . . .  probably the DonNELL\nboy; and if resemblance went for anything, his sister was sitting across\nthe aisle with Mary Bell. Anne wondered what sort of mother the child\nhad, to send her to school dressed as she was. She wore a faded pink\nsilk dress, trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace, soiled white\nkid slippers, and silk stockings. Her sandy hair was tortured into\ninnumerable kinky and unnatural curls, surmounted by a flamboyant bow\nof pink ribbon bigger than her head. Judging from her expression she was\nvery well satisfied with herself.\n\nA pale little thing, with smooth ripples of fine, silky, fawn-colored\nhair flowing over her shoulders, must, Anne thought, be Annetta Bell,\nwhose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district, but,\nby reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were\nnow in Avonlea. Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were\ncertainly Cottons; and there was no doubt that the small beauty with\nthe long brown curls and hazel eyes, who was casting coquettish looks at\nJack Gills over the edge of her Testament, was Prillie Rogerson, whose\nfather had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from\nher grandmother\'s in Grafton. A tall, awkward girl in a back seat, who\nseemed to have too many feet and hands, Anne could not place at all, but\nlater on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come\nto live with an Avonlea aunt. She was also to find that if Barbara ever\nmanaged to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody\nelse\'s feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch\nwall to commemorate it.\n\nBut when Anne\'s eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing\nher own, a queer little thrill went over her, as if she had found her\ngenius. She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde\nhad been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the\nAvonlea children. More than that, Anne realized that he was unlike other\nchildren anywhere, and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own\ngazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so\nintently.\n\nShe knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight. He had the most\nbeautiful little face she had ever seen in a child . . .  features of\nexquisite delicacy and refinement, framed in a halo of chestnut curls.\nHis mouth was delicious, being full without pouting, the crimson lips\njust softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners\nthat narrowly escaped being dimpled. He had a sober, grave, meditative\nexpression, as if his spirit was much older than his body; but when\nAnne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile, which\nseemed an illumination of his whole being, as if some lamp had suddenly\nkindled into flame inside of him, irradiating him from top to toe. Best\nof all, it was involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but\nsimply the outflashing of a hidden personality, rare and fine and sweet.\nWith a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends\nforever before a word had passed between them.\n\nThe day went by like a dream. Anne could never clearly recall it\nafterwards. It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching\nbut somebody else. She heard classes and worked sums and set copies\nmechanically. The children behaved quite well; only two cases of\ndiscipline occurred. Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained\ncrickets in the aisle. Anne stood Morley on the platform for an\nhour and . . . which Morley felt much more keenly . . .  confiscated his\ncrickets. She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free\nin Violet Vale; but Morley believed, then and ever afterwards, that she\ntook them home and kept them for her own amusement.\n\nThe other culprit was Anthony Pye, who poured the last drops of water\nfrom his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay\'s neck. Anne kept\nAnthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of\ngentlemen, admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies\'\nnecks. She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen, she said. Her little\nlecture was quite kind and touching; but unfortunately Anthony remained\nabsolutely untouched. He listened to her in silence, with the same\nsullen expression, and whistled scornfully as he went out. Anne\nsighed; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye\'s\naffections, like the building of Rome, wasn\'t the work of a day. In\nfact, it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to\nwin; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony, who looked as if he might\nbe a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness.\n\nWhen school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily\ninto her chair. Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged. There\nwas no real reason for discouragement, since nothing very dreadful had\noccurred; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would\nnever learn to like teaching. And how terrible it would be to be doing\nsomething you didn\'t like every day for . . . well, say forty years. Anne\nwas of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there, or wait\ntill she was safely in her own white room at home. Before she could\ndecide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor,\nand Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her\nrecall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison\'s on an overdressed female he\nhad seen in a Charlottetown store. ""She looked like a head-on collision\nbetween a fashion plate and a nightmare.""\n\nThe newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk, puffed,\nfrilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or shirring could possibly\nbe placed. Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat, bedecked\nwith three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers. A veil of pink\nchiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots, hung like a flounce\nfrom the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers\nbehind her. She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small\nwoman, and a very strong odor of perfume attended her.\n\n""I am Mrs. DonNELL . . . Mrs. H. B. DonNELL,"" announced this vision, ""and\nI have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when\nshe came home to dinner today. It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY.""\n\n""I\'m sorry,"" faltered Anne, vainly trying to recollect any incident of\nthe morning connected with the Donnell children.\n\n""Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell. Now, Miss\nShirley, the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL . . .  accent on\nthe last syllable. I hope you\'ll remember this in future.""\n\n""I\'ll try to,"" gasped Anne, choking back a wild desire to laugh. ""I know\nby experience that it\'s very unpleasant to have one\'s name SPELLED wrong\nand I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong.""\n\n""Certainly it is. And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my\nson Jacob.""\n\n""He told me his name was Jacob,"" protested Anne.\n\n""I might well have expected that,"" said Mrs. H. B. Donnell, in a tone\nwhich implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in\nthis degenerate age. ""That boy has such plebeian tastes, Miss Shirley.\nWhen he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair  . . . it sounds SO\naristocratic, doesn\'t it? But his father insisted he should be called\nJacob after his uncle. I yielded, because Uncle Jacob was a rich old\nbachelor. And what do you think, Miss Shirley? When our innocent boy was\nfive years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has\nthree boys of his own. Did you ever hear of such ingratitude? The moment\nthe invitation to the wedding . . . for he had the impertinence to send\nus an invitation, Miss Shirley . . . came to the house I said, \'No more\nJacobs for me, thank you.\' From that day I called my son St. Clair and\nSt. Clair I am determined he shall be called. His father obstinately\ncontinues to call him Jacob, and the boy himself has a perfectly\nunaccountable preference for the vulgar name. But St. Clair he is and\nSt. Clair he shall remain. You will kindly remember this, Miss Shirley,\nwill you not? THANK you. I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was\nonly a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right. Donnell. . .\naccent on the last syllable . . . and St. Clair . . . on no account\nJacob. You\'ll remember? THANK you.""\n\nWhen Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and\nwent home. At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch\nPath. He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids\nwhich Avonlea children called ""rice lillies.""\n\n""Please, teacher, I found these in Mr. Wright\'s field,"" he said shyly,\n""and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the\nkind of lady that would like them, and because . . ."" he lifted his big\nbeautiful eyes . . . ""I like you, teacher.""\n\n""You darling,"" said Anne, taking the fragrant spikes. As if Paul\'s words\nhad been a spell of magic, discouragement and weariness passed from her\nspirit, and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain. She went\nthrough the Birch Path light-footedly, attended by the sweetness of her\norchids as by a benediction.\n\n""Well, how did you get along?"" Marilla wanted to know.\n\n""Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you. I can\'t now\n. . . I don\'t know myself . . . I\'m too near it. My thoughts feel as if\nthey had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy. The only\nthing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught\nCliffie Wright that A is A. He never knew it before. Isn\'t it something\nto have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and\nParadise Lost?""\n\nMrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement. That good lady had\nwaylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they\nliked their new teacher.\n\n""And every one of them said they liked you splendid, Anne, except\nAnthony Pye. I must admit he didn\'t. He said you \'weren\'t any good,\njust like all girl teachers.\' There\'s the Pye leaven for you. But never\nmind.""\n\n""I\'m not going to mind,"" said Anne quietly, ""and I\'m going to make\nAnthony Pye like me yet. Patience and kindness will surely win him.""\n\n""Well, you can never tell about a Pye,"" said Mrs. Rachel cautiously.\n""They go by contraries, like dreams, often as not. As for that DonNELL\nwoman, she\'ll get no DonNELLing from me, I can assure you. The name is\nDONnell and always has been. The woman is crazy, that\'s what. She has a\npug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with\nthe family, eating off a china plate. I\'d be afraid of a judgment if I\nwas her. Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible, hard-working man,\nbut he hadn\'t much gumption when he picked out a wife, that\'s what.""\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAll Sorts and Conditions of Men . . . and women\n\n\nA September day on Prince Edward Island hills; a crisp wind blowing\nup over the sand dunes from the sea; a long red road, winding through\nfields and woods, now looping itself about a corner of thick set\nspruces, now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery\nsheets of ferns beneath them, now dipping down into a hollow where a\nbrook flashed out of the woods and into them again, now basking in\nopen sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters;\nair athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets, those glad little\npensioners of the summer hills; a plump brown pony ambling along the\nroad; two girls behind him, full to the lips with the simple, priceless\njoy of youth and life.\n\n""Oh, this is a day left over from Eden, isn\'t it, Diana?"" . . . and Anne\nsighed for sheer happiness. ""The air has magic in it. Look at the purple\nin the cup of the harvest valley, Diana. And oh, do smell the dying fir!\nIt\'s coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has\nbeen cutting fence poles. Bliss is it on such a day to be alive; but\nto smell dying fir is very heaven. That\'s two thirds Wordsworth and one\nthird Anne Shirley. It doesn\'t seem possible that there should be dying\nfir in heaven, does it? And yet it doesn\'t seem to me that heaven would\nbe quite perfect if you couldn\'t get a whiff of dead fir as you went\nthrough its woods. Perhaps we\'ll have the odor there without the death.\nYes, I think that will be the way. That delicious aroma must be the\nsouls of the firs . . . and of course it will be just souls in heaven.""\n\n""Trees haven\'t souls,"" said practical Diana, ""but the smell of dead fir\nis certainly lovely. I\'m going to make a cushion and fill it with fir\nneedles. You\'d better make one too, Anne.""\n\n""I think I shall . . . and use it for my naps. I\'d be certain to dream I\nwas a dryad or a woodnymph then. But just this minute I\'m well content\nto be Anne Shirley, Avonlea schoolma\'am, driving over a road like this\non such a sweet, friendly day.""\n\n""It\'s a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us,""\nsighed Diana. ""Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road, Anne?\nAlmost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it, and we\'ll probably be\ntreated as if we were begging for ourselves. It\'s the very worst road of\nall.""\n\n""That is why I chose it. Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken\nthis road if we had asked them. But you see, Diana, I feel myself\nresponsible for the A.V.I.S., since I was the first to suggest it, and\nit seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things. I\'m\nsorry on your account; but you needn\'t say a word at the cranky places.\nI\'ll do all the talking . . .  Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to.\nMrs. Lynde doesn\'t know whether to approve of our enterprise or not. She\ninclines to, when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of\nit; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in\nthe States is a count against it. So she is halting between two opinions\nand only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde\'s eyes. Priscilla is\ngoing to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting, and I expect it\nwill be good, for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs\nin the family. I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found\nout that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla\'s aunt. It seemed so\nwonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote \'Edgewood\nDays\' and \'The Rosebud Garden.\'""\n\n""Where does Mrs. Morgan live?""\n\n""In Toronto. And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit\nnext summer, and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have\nus meet her. That seems almost too good to be true--but it\'s something\npleasant to imagine after you go to bed.""\n\nThe Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact.\nGilbert Blythe was president, Fred Wright vice-president, Anne Shirley\nsecretary, and Diana Barry treasurer. The ""Improvers,"" as they were\npromptly christened, were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of\nthe members. It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many\nimprovements so late in the season; but they meant to plan the next\nsummer\'s campaign, collect and discuss ideas, write and read papers,\nand, as Anne said, educate the public sentiment generally.\n\nThere was some disapproval, of course, and . . . which the Improvers felt\nmuch more keenly . . . a good deal of ridicule. Mr. Elisha Wright was\nreported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization\nwould be Courting Club. Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the\nImprovers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with\ngeraniums. Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers\nwould insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after\nplans approved by the society. Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he\nwished they would kindly shovel down the church hill. Eben Wright told\nAnne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to\nkeep his whiskers trimmed. Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash\nhis barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace\ncurtains in the cowstable windows. Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton\nSloane, an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory,\nif it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand\nhand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it.\n\nIn spite of . . . or perhaps, human nature being what it is, because of\n. . . this, the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they\ncould hope to bring about that fall. At the second meeting, in the Barry\nparlor, Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle\nand paint the hall; Julia Bell seconded it, with an uneasy feeling that\nshe was doing something not exactly ladylike. Gilbert put the motion,\nit was carried unanimously, and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes.\nThe next thing was to appoint a committee, and Gertie Pye, determined\nnot to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels, boldly moved that Miss\nJane Andrews be chairman of said committee. This motion being also duly\nseconded and carried, Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie\non the committee, along with Gilbert, Anne, Diana, and Fred Wright. The\ncommittee chose their routes in private conclave. Anne and Diana were\ntold off for the Newbridge road, Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands\nroad, and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road.\n\n""Because,"" explained Gilbert to Anne, as they walked home together\nthrough the Haunted Wood, ""the Pyes all live along that road and they\nwon\'t give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them.""\n\nThe next Saturday Anne and Diana started out. They drove to the end of\nthe road and canvassed homeward, calling first on the ""Andrew girls.""\n\n""If Catherine is alone we may get something,"" said Diana, ""but if Eliza\nis there we won\'t.""\n\nEliza was there . . . very much so . . . and looked even grimmer than\nusual. Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression\nthat life is indeed a vale of tears, and that a smile, never to speak of\na laugh, is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible. The Andrew\ngirls had been ""girls"" for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain\ngirls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage. Catherine, it was said,\nhad not entirely given up hope, but Eliza, who was born a pessimist, had\nnever had any. They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny\ncorner scooped out of Mark Andrew\'s beech woods. Eliza complained that\nit was terrible hot in summer, but Catherine was wont to say it was\nlovely and warm in winter.\n\nEliza was sewing patchwork, not because it was needed but simply as\na protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting. Eliza\nlistened with a frown and Catherine with a smile, as the girls explained\ntheir errand. To be sure, whenever Catherine caught Eliza\'s eye she\ndiscarded the smile in guilty confusion; but it crept back the next\nmoment.\n\n""If I had money to waste,"" said Eliza grimly, ""I\'d burn it up and have\nthe fun of seeing a blaze maybe; but I wouldn\'t give it to that hall,\nnot a cent. It\'s no benefit to the settlement . . . just a place for young\nfolks to meet and carry on when they\'s better be home in their beds.""\n\n""Oh, Eliza, young folks must have some amusement,"" protested Catherine.\n\n""I don\'t see the necessity. We didn\'t gad about to halls and places when\nwe were young, Catherine Andrews. This world is getting worse every day.""\n\n""I think it\'s getting better,"" said Catherine firmly.\n\n""YOU think!"" Miss Eliza\'s voice expressed the utmost contempt. ""It\ndoesn\'t signify what you THINK, Catherine Andrews. Facts is facts.""\n\n""Well, I always like to look on the bright side, Eliza.""\n\n""There isn\'t any bright side.""\n\n""Oh, indeed there is,"" cried Anne, who couldn\'t endure such heresy in\nsilence. ""Why, there are ever so many bright sides, Miss Andrews. It\'s\nreally a beautiful world.""\n\n""You won\'t have such a high opinion of it when you\'ve lived as long\nin it as I have,"" retorted Miss Eliza sourly, ""and you won\'t be so\nenthusiastic about improving it either. How is your mother, Diana? Dear\nme, but she has failed of late. She looks terrible run down. And how\nlong is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind, Anne?""\n\n""The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very\ncareful,"" faltered Anne.\n\nEliza shook her head.\n\n""Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up. I\nwouldn\'t have much hope if I was her. It\'s best to be prepared for the\nworst.""\n\n""But oughtn\'t we be prepared for the best too?"" pleaded Anne. ""It\'s just\nas likely to happen as the worst.""\n\n""Not in my experience, and I\'ve fifty-seven years to set against your\nsixteen,"" retorted Eliza. ""Going, are you? Well, I hope this new society\nof yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill\nbut I haven\'t much hope of it.""\n\nAnne and Diana got themselves thankfully out, and drove away as fast as\nthe fat pony could go. As they rounded the curve below the beech wood\na plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews\' pasture, waving to them\nexcitedly. It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that\nshe could hardly speak, but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne\'s\nhand.\n\n""That\'s my contribution to painting the hall,"" she gasped. ""I\'d like to\ngive you a dollar but I don\'t dare take more from my egg money for Eliza\nwould find it out if I did. I\'m real interested in your society and I\nbelieve you\'re going to do a lot of good. I\'m an optimist. I HAVE to be,\nliving with Eliza. I must hurry back before she misses me . . . she thinks\nI\'m feeding the hens. I hope you\'ll have good luck canvassing, and don\'t\nbe cast down over what Eliza said. The world IS getting better . . . it\ncertainly is.""\n\nThe next house was Daniel Blair\'s.\n\n""Now, it all depends on whether his wife is home or not,"" said Diana,\nas they jolted along a deep-rutted lane. ""If she is we won\'t get a cent.\nEverybody says Dan Blair doesn\'t dare have his hair cut without\nasking her permission; and it\'s certain she\'s very close, to state it\nmoderately. She says she has to be just before she\'s generous. But Mrs.\nLynde says she\'s so much \'before\' that generosity never catches up with\nher at all.""\n\nAnne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that\nevening.\n\n""We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door. Nobody came but\nthe door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry, going on\ndreadfully. We couldn\'t make out the words but Diana says she knows they\nwere swearing by the sound of them. I can\'t believe that of Mr.\nBlair, for he is always so quiet and meek; but at least he had great\nprovocation, for Marilla, when that poor man came to the door, red as\na beet, with perspiration streaming down his face, he had on one of his\nwife\'s big gingham aprons. \'I can\'t get this durned thing off,\' he said,\n\'for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I can\'t bust \'em, so you\'ll\nhave to excuse me, ladies.\' We begged him not to mention it and went in\nand sat down. Mr. Blair sat down too; he twisted the apron around to\nhis back and rolled it up, but he did look so ashamed and worried that\nI felt sorry for him, and Diana said she feared we had called at an\ninconvenient time. \'Oh, not at all,\' said Mr. Blair, trying to smile\n. . . you know he is always very polite . . . \'I\'m a little busy . . .\ngetting ready to bake a cake as it were. My wife got a telegram today\nthat her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she\'s gone to the\ntrain to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea. She\nwrit out the recipe and told me what to do but I\'ve clean forgot half\nthe directions already. And it says, \'flavor according to taste.\' What\ndoes that mean? How can you tell? And what if my taste doesn\'t happen to\nbe other people\'s taste? Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a\nsmall layer cake?""\n\n""I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man. He didn\'t seem to be in his\nproper sphere at all. I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt\nthat I saw one. It was on my lips to say, \'Mr. Blair, if you\'ll give\nus a subscription for the hall I\'ll mix up your cake for you.\' But I\nsuddenly thought it wouldn\'t be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain\nwith a fellow creature in distress. So I offered to mix the cake for him\nwithout any conditions at all. He just jumped at my offer. He said he\'d\nbeen used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared\ncake was beyond him, and yet he hated to disappoint his wife. He got me\nanother apron, and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake. Mr. Blair\nran about and got us the materials. He had forgotten all about his apron\nand when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought\nshe would die to see it. He said he could bake the cake all right . . . he\nwas used to that . . . and then he asked for our list and he put down four\ndollars. So you see we were rewarded. But even if he hadn\'t given a cent\nI\'d always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him.""\n\nTheodore White\'s was the next stopping place. Neither Anne nor Diana\nhad ever been there before, and they had only a very slight acquaintance\nwith Mrs. Theodore, who was not given to hospitality. Should they go to\nthe back or front door? While they held a whispered consultation Mrs.\nTheodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers.\nDeliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the\nporch steps, and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified\ncallers.\n\n""Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on\nthese papers?"" she said anxiously. ""I\'ve just swept the house all over\nand I can\'t have any more dust tracked in. The path\'s been real muddy\nsince the rain yesterday.""\n\n""Don\'t you dare laugh,"" warned Anne in a whisper, as they marched along\nthe newspapers. ""And I implore you, Diana, not to look at me, no matter\nwhat she says, or I shall not be able to keep a sober face.""\n\nThe papers extended across the hall and into a prim, fleckless parlor.\nAnne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained\ntheir errand. Mrs. White heard them politely, interrupting only twice,\nonce to chase out an adventurous fly, and once to pick up a tiny wisp\nof grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne\'s dress. Anne felt\nwretchedly guilty; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the\nmoney down . . . ""to prevent us from having to go back for it,"" Diana said\nwhen they got away. Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before\nthey had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw\nher busily wielding a broom in the hall.\n\n""I\'ve always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman\nalive and I\'ll believe it after this,"" said Diana, giving way to her\nsuppressed laughter as soon as it was safe.\n\n""I am glad she has no children,"" said Anne solemnly. ""It would be\ndreadful beyond words for them if she had.""\n\nAt the Spencers\' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying\nsomething ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea. Mr. Thomas Boulter\nrefused to give anything because the hall, when it had been built,\ntwenty years before, hadn\'t been built on the site he recommended. Mrs.\nEsther Bell, who was the picture of health, took half an hour to detail\nall her aches and pains, and sadly put down fifty cents because she\nwouldn\'t be there that time next year to do it . . . no, she would be in\nher grave.\n\nTheir worst reception, however, was at Simon Fletcher\'s. When they\ndrove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch\nwindow. But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently\nnobody came to the door. Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove\naway from Simon Fletcher\'s. Even Anne admitted that she was beginning\nto feel discouraged. But the tide turned after that. Several Sloane\nhomesteads came next, where they got liberal subscriptions, and from\nthat to the end they fared well, with only an occasional snub. Their\nlast place of call was at Robert Dickson\'s by the pond bridge. They\nstayed to tea here, although they were nearly home, rather than risk\noffending Mrs. Dickson, who had the reputation of being a very ""touchy""\nwoman.\n\nWhile they were there old Mrs. James White called in.\n\n""I\'ve just been down to Lorenzo\'s,"" she announced. ""He\'s the proudest\nman in Avonlea this minute. What do you think? There\'s a brand new boy\nthere . . . and after seven girls that\'s quite an event, I can tell you.""\nAnne pricked up her ears, and when they drove away she said.\n\n""I\'m going straight to Lorenzo White\'s.""\n\n""But he lives on the White Sands road and it\'s quite a distance out of\nour way,"" protested Diana. ""Gilbert and Fred will canvass him.""\n\n""They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late\nby then,"" said Anne firmly. ""The novelty will be worn off. Lorenzo\nWhite is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now. We\nmustn\'t let such a golden opportunity slip, Diana."" The result justified\nAnne\'s foresight. Mr. White met them in the yard, beaming like the\nsun upon an Easter day. When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed\nenthusiastically.\n\n""Certain, certain. Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest\nsubscription you\'ve got.""\n\n""That will be five dollars . . . Mr. Daniel Blair put down four,"" said\nAnne, half afraid. But Lorenzo did not flinch.\n\n""Five it is . . . and here\'s the money on the spot. Now, I want you\nto come into the house. There\'s something in there worth seeing . . .\nsomething very few people have seen as yet. Just come in and pass YOUR\nopinion.""\n\n""What will we say if the baby isn\'t pretty?"" whispered Diana in\ntrepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house.\n\n""Oh, there will certainly be something else nice to say about it,"" said\nAnne easily. ""There always is about a baby.""\n\nThe baby WAS pretty, however, and Mr. White felt that he got his five\ndollars\' worth of the girls\' honest delight over the plump little\nnewcomer. But that was the first, last, and only time that Lorenzo White\never subscribed to anything.\n\nAnne, tired as she was, made one more effort for the public weal that\nnight, slipping over the fields to interview Mr. Harrison, who was as\nusual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him. Strickly\nspeaking he was on the Carmody road; but Jane and Gertie, who were not\nacquainted with him save by doubtful report, had nervously begged Anne\nto canvass him.\n\nMr. Harrison, however, flatly refused to subscribe a cent, and all\nAnne\'s wiles were in vain.\n\n""But I thought you approved of our society, Mr. Harrison,"" she mourned.\n\n""So I do . . . so I do . . . but my approval doesn\'t go as deep as my\npocket, Anne.""\n\n""A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much\nof a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews,"" Anne told her reflection in the\neast gable mirror at bedtime.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThe Pointing of Duty\n\n\nAnne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed. She\nwas sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises, but the\nclosely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection\nwith studies or school work.\n\n""What is the matter?"" asked Gilbert, who had arrived at the open kitchen\ndoor just in time to hear the sigh.\n\nAnne colored, and thrust her writing out of sight under some school\ncompositions.\n\n""Nothing very dreadful. I was just trying to write out some of my\nthoughts, as Professor Hamilton advised me, but I couldn\'t get them to\nplease me. They seem so still and foolish directly they\'re written down\non white paper with black ink. Fancies are like shadows . . .  you can\'t\ncage them, they\'re such wayward, dancing things. But perhaps I\'ll learn\nthe secret some day if I keep on trying. I haven\'t a great many spare\nmoments, you know. By the time I finish correcting school exercises and\ncompositions, I don\'t always feel like writing any of my own.""\n\n""You are getting on splendidly in school, Anne. All the children like\nyou,"" said Gilbert, sitting down on the stone step.\n\n""No, not all. Anthony Pye doesn\'t and WON\'T like me. What is worse, he\ndoesn\'t respect me . . . no, he doesn\'t. He simply holds me in contempt\nand I don\'t mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably. It\nisn\'t that he is so very bad . . . he is only rather mischievous, but no\nworse than some of the others. He seldom disobeys me; but he obeys with\na scornful air of toleration as if it wasn\'t worthwhile disputing the\npoint or he would . . . and it has a bad effect on the others. I\'ve tried\nevery way to win him but I\'m beginning to fear I never shall. I want to,\nfor he\'s rather a cute little lad, if he IS a Pye, and I could like him\nif he\'d let me.""\n\n""Probably it\'s merely the effect of what he hears at home.""\n\n""Not altogether. Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his\nown mind about things. He has always gone to men before and he says girl\nteachers are no good. Well, we\'ll see what patience and kindness\nwill do. I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very\ninteresting work. Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the\nothers. That child is a perfect darling, Gilbert, and a genius into the\nbargain. I\'m persuaded the world will hear of him some day,"" concluded\nAnne in a tone of conviction.\n\n""I like teaching, too,"" said Gilbert. ""It\'s good training, for one\nthing. Why, Anne, I\'ve learned more in the weeks I\'ve been teaching the\nyoung ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to\nschool myself. We all seem to be getting on pretty well. The Newbridge\npeople like Jane, I hear; and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied\nwith your humble servant . . . all except Mr. Andrew Spencer. I met Mrs.\nPeter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it\nher duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer didn\'t approve of my methods.""\n\n""Have you ever noticed,"" asked Anne reflectively, ""that when people\nsay it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for\nsomething disagreeable? Why is it that they never seem to think it a\nduty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you? Mrs. H. B.\nDonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought\nit HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew didn\'t approve of\nmy reading fairy tales to the children, and that Mr. Rogerson thought\nPrillie wasn\'t coming on fast enough in arithmetic. If Prillie would\nspend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do\nbetter. I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her,\nthough I\'ve never been able to catch him red-handed.""\n\n""Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL\'s hopeful son to his\nsaintly name?""\n\n""Yes,"" laughed Anne, ""but it was really a difficult task. At first, when\nI called him \'St. Clair\' he would not take the least notice until I\'d\nspoken two or three times; and then, when the other boys nudged him, he\nwould look up with such an aggrieved air, as if I\'d called him John or\nCharlie and he couldn\'t be expected to know I meant him. So I kept\nhim in after school one night and talked kindly to him. I told him his\nmother wished me to call him St. Clair and I couldn\'t go against her\nwishes. He saw it when it was all explained out . . . he\'s really a very\nreasonable little fellow . . . and he said _I_ could call him St. Clair\nbut that he\'d \'lick the stuffing\' out of any of the boys that tried it.\nOf course, I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language.\nSince then _I_ call him St. Clair and the boys call him Jake and all\ngoes smoothly. He informs me that he means to be a carpenter, but Mrs.\nDonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him.""\n\nThe mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert\'s thoughts, and\nthey talked for a time of their plans and wishes . . . gravely, earnestly,\nhopefully, as youth loves to talk, while the future is yet an untrodden\npath full of wonderful possibilities.\n\nGilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor.\n\n""It\'s a splendid profession,"" he said enthusiastically. ""A fellow has to\nfight something all through life . . . didn\'t somebody once define man\nas a fighting animal? . . . and I want to fight disease and pain and\nignorance . . . which are all members one of another. I want to do my\nshare of honest, real work in the world, Anne . . .  add a little to the\nsum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating\nsince it began. The folks who lived before me have done so much for me\nthat I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who\nwill live after me. It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get\nsquare with his obligations to the race.""\n\n""I\'d like to add some beauty to life,"" said Anne dreamily. ""I don\'t\nexactly want to make people KNOW more . . . though I know that IS the\nnoblest ambition . . . but I\'d love to make them have a pleasanter time\nbecause of me . . . to have some little joy or happy thought that would\nnever have existed if I hadn\'t been born.""\n\n""I think you\'re fulfilling that ambition every day,"" said Gilbert\nadmiringly.\n\nAnd he was right. Anne was one of the children of light by birthright.\nAfter she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across\nit like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it, for the time\nbeing at least, as hopeful and lovely and of good report.\n\nFinally Gilbert rose regretfully.\n\n""Well, I must run up to MacPhersons\'. Moody Spurgeon came home from\nQueen\'s today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor\nBoyd is lending me.""\n\n""And I must get Marilla\'s tea. She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening\nand she will soon be back.""\n\nAnne had tea ready when Marilla came home; the fire was crackling\ncheerily, a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves\nadorned the table, and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the\nair. But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh.\n\n""Are your eyes troubling you? Does your head ache?"" queried Anne\nanxiously.\n\n""No. I\'m only tired . . . and worried. It\'s about Mary and those children\n . . . Mary is worse . . . she can\'t last much longer. And as for the\ntwins, _I_ don\'t know what is to become of them.""\n\n""Hasn\'t their uncle been heard from?""\n\n""Yes, Mary had a letter from him. He\'s working in a lumber camp and\n\'shacking it,\' whatever that means. Anyway, he says he can\'t possibly\ntake the children till the spring. He expects to be married then and\nwill have a home to take them to; but he says she must get some of the\nneighbors to keep them for the winter. She says she can\'t bear to ask\nany of them. Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people\nand that\'s a fact. And the long and short of it is, Anne, that I\'m\nsure Mary wants me to take those children . . . she didn\'t say so but she\nLOOKED it.""\n\n""Oh!"" Anne clasped her hands, all athrill with excitement. ""And of\ncourse you will, Marilla, won\'t you?""\n\n""I haven\'t made up my mind,"" said Marilla rather tartly. ""I don\'t rush\ninto things in your headlong way, Anne. Third cousinship is a pretty\nslim claim. And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children\nof six years to look after . . . twins, at that.""\n\nMarilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single\nchildren.\n\n""Twins are very interesting . . . at least one pair of them,"" said Anne.\n""It\'s only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous.\nAnd I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you\nwhen I\'m away in school.""\n\n""I don\'t reckon there\'d be much amusement in it . . . more worry and\nbother than anything else, I should say. It wouldn\'t be so risky if they\nwere even as old as you were when I took you. I wouldn\'t mind Dora so\nmuch . . . she seems good and quiet. But that Davy is a limb.""\n\nAnne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins.\nThe remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with\nher still. She knew that Marilla\'s only vulnerable point was her stern\ndevotion to what she believed to be her duty, and Anne skillfully\nmarshalled her arguments along this line.\n\n""If Davy is naughty it\'s all the more reason why he should have good\ntraining, isn\'t it, Marilla? If we don\'t take them we don\'t know who\nwill, nor what kind of influences may surround them. Suppose Mrs.\nKeith\'s next door neighbors, the Sprotts, were to take them. Mrs. Lynde\nsays Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you can\'t\nbelieve a word his children say. Wouldn\'t it be dreadful to have the\ntwins learn anything like that? Or suppose they went to the Wiggins\'.\nMrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can\nbe sold and brings his family up on skim milk. You wouldn\'t like your\nrelations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would\nyou? It seems to me, Marilla, that it is our duty to take them.""\n\n""I suppose it is,"" assented Marilla gloomily. ""I daresay I\'ll tell Mary\nI\'ll take them. You needn\'t look so delighted, Anne. It will mean a good\ndeal of extra work for you. I can\'t sew a stitch on account of my eyes,\nso you\'ll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes. And\nyou don\'t like sewing.""\n\n""I hate it,"" said Anne calmly, ""but if you are willing to take those\nchildren from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense\nof duty. It does people good to have to do things they don\'t like . . . in\nmoderation.""\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMarilla Adopts Twins\n\n\nMrs. Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window, knitting a quilt,\njust as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when\nMatthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs. Rachel\ncalled ""his imported orphan."" But that had been in springtime; and this\nwas late autumn, and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and\nbrown. The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden\npomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a\ncomfortable brown nag came down the hill. Mrs. Rachel peered at it\neagerly.\n\n""There\'s Marilla getting home from the funeral,"" she said to her\nhusband, who was lying on the kitchen lounge. Thomas Lynde lay more on\nthe lounge nowadays than he had been used to do, but Mrs. Rachel, who\nwas so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household, had not as\nyet noticed this. ""And she\'s got the twins with her, . . . yes, there\'s\nDavy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony\'s tail and Marilla\njerking him back. Dora\'s sitting up on the seat as prim as you please.\nShe always looks as if she\'d just been starched and ironed. Well, poor\nMarilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake.\nStill, I don\'t see that she could do anything less than take them, under\nthe circumstances, and she\'ll have Anne to help her. Anne\'s tickled\nto death over the whole business, and she has a real knacky way with\nchildren, I must say. Dear me, it doesn\'t seem a day since poor Matthew\nbrought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla\nbringing up a child. And now she has adopted twins. You\'re never safe\nfrom being surprised till you\'re dead.""\n\nThe fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde\'s Hollow and along the\nGreen Gables lane. Marilla\'s face was rather grim. It was ten miles from\nEast Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for\nperpetual motion. It was beyond Marilla\'s power to make him sit still\nand she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back\nof the wagon and break his neck, or tumble over the dashboard under the\npony\'s heels. In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when\nshe got him home. Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap, regardless of\nthe reins, flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like\nhug.\n\n""I don\'t believe you mean it,"" he said, smacking her wrinkled cheek\naffectionately. ""You don\'t LOOK like a lady who\'d whip a little boy just\n\'cause he couldn\'t keep still. Didn\'t you find it awful hard to keep\nstill when you was only \'s old as me?""\n\n""No, I always kept still when I was told,"" said Marilla, trying to speak\nsternly, albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy\'s\nimpulsive caresses.\n\n""Well, I s\'pose that was \'cause you was a girl,"" said Davy, squirming\nback to his place after another hug. ""You WAS a girl once, I s\'pose,\nthough it\'s awful funny to think of it. Dora can sit still . . . but there\nain\'t much fun in it _I_ don\'t think. Seems to me it must be slow to be\na girl. Here, Dora, let me liven you up a bit.""\n\nDavy\'s method of ""livening up"" was to grasp Dora\'s curls in his fingers\nand give them a tug. Dora shrieked and then cried.\n\n""How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her\ngrave this very day?"" demanded Marilla despairingly.\n\n""But she was glad to die,"" said Davy confidentially. ""I know, \'cause\nshe told me so. She was awful tired of being sick. We\'d a long talk the\nnight before she died. She told me you was going to take me and Dora for\nthe winter and I was to be a good boy. I\'m going to be good, but can\'t\nyou be good running round just as well as sitting still? And she said I\nwas always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her, and I\'m going to.""\n\n""Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her?""\n\n""Well, I ain\'t going to let anybody else pull it,"" said Davy, doubling\nup his fists and frowning. ""They\'d just better try it. I didn\'t hurt her\nmuch . . . she just cried \'cause she\'s a girl. I\'m glad I\'m a boy but I\'m\nsorry I\'m a twin. When Jimmy Sprott\'s sister conterdicks him he just\nsays, \'I\'m oldern you, so of course I know better,\' and that settles\nHER. But I can\'t tell Dora that, and she just goes on thinking diffrunt\nfrom me. You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell, since I\'m a\nman.""\n\nAltogether, Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own\nyard, where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown\nleaves. Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out. Dora\nsubmitted calmly to be kissed, but Davy responded to Anne\'s welcome\nwith one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement, ""I\'m Mr. Davy\nKeith.""\n\nAt the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady, but Davy\'s manners\nleft much to be desired.\n\n""I\'m so hungry I ain\'t got time to eat p\'litely,"" he said when Marilla\nreproved him. ""Dora ain\'t half as hungry as I am. Look at all the\nex\'cise I took on the road here. That cake\'s awful nice and plummy. We\nhaven\'t had any cake at home for ever\'n ever so long, \'cause mother was\ntoo sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do\nto bake our bread for us. And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER\ncakes. Catch her! Can I have another piece?""\n\nMarilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice.\nHowever, she reminded Davy that he ought to say ""Thank you"" for it. Davy\nmerely grinned at her and took a huge bite. When he had finished the\nslice he said,\n\n""If you\'ll give me ANOTHER piece I\'ll say thank you for IT.""\n\n""No, you have had plenty of cake,"" said Marilla in a tone which Anne\nknew and Davy was to learn to be final.\n\nDavy winked at Anne, and then, leaning over the table, snatched Dora\'s\nfirst piece of cake, from which she had just taken one dainty little\nbite, out of her very fingers and, opening his mouth to the fullest\nextent, crammed the whole slice in. Dora\'s lip trembled and Marilla\nwas speechless with horror. Anne promptly exclaimed, with her best\n""schoolma\'am"" air,\n\n""Oh, Davy, gentlemen don\'t do things like that.""\n\n""I know they don\'t,"" said Davy, as soon as he could speak, ""but I ain\'t\na gemplum.""\n\n""But don\'t you want to be?"" said shocked Anne.\n\n""Course I do. But you can\'t be a gemplum till you grow up.""\n\n""Oh, indeed you can,"" Anne hastened to say, thinking she saw a chance to\nsow good seed betimes. ""You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a\nlittle boy. And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies . . .  or forget\nto say thank you . . . or pull anybody\'s hair.""\n\n""They don\'t have much fun, that\'s a fact,"" said Davy frankly. ""I guess\nI\'ll wait till I\'m grown up to be one.""\n\nMarilla, with a resigned air, had cut another piece of cake for Dora.\nShe did not feel able to cope with Davy just then. It had been a hard\nday for her, what with the funeral and the long drive. At that moment\nshe looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done\ncredit to Eliza Andrews herself.\n\nThe twins were not noticeably alike, although both were fair. Dora had\nlong sleek curls that never got out of order. Davy had a crop of fuzzy\nlittle yellow ringlets all over his round head. Dora\'s hazel eyes were\ngentle and mild; Davy\'s were as roguish and dancing as an elf\'s. Dora\'s\nnose was straight, Davy\'s a positive snub; Dora had a ""prunes and\nprisms"" mouth, Davy\'s was all smiles; and besides, he had a dimple\nin one cheek and none in the other, which gave him a dear, comical,\nlopsided look when he laughed. Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner\nof his little face.\n\n""They\'d better go to bed,"" said Marilla, who thought it was the easiest\nway to dispose of them. ""Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in\nthe west gable. You\'re not afraid to sleep alone, are you, Davy?""\n\n""No; but I ain\'t going to bed for ever so long yet,"" said Davy\ncomfortably.\n\n""Oh, yes, you are."" That was all the much-tried Marilla said, but\nsomething in her tone squelched even Davy. He trotted obediently\nupstairs with Anne.\n\n""When I\'m grown up the very first thing I\'m going to do is stay up ALL\nnight just to see what it would be like,"" he told her confidentially.\n\nIn after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins\'\nsojourn at Green Gables without a shiver. Not that it really was so much\nworse than the weeks that followed it; but it seemed so by reason of its\nnovelty. There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not\nin mischief or devising it; but his first notable exploit occurred two\ndays after his arrival, on Sunday morning . . . a fine, warm day, as\nhazy and mild as September. Anne dressed him for church while Marilla\nattended to Dora. Davy at first objected strongly to having his face\nwashed.\n\n""Marilla washed it yesterday . . . and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard\nsoap the day of the funeral. That\'s enough for one week. I don\'t see the\ngood of being so awful clean. It\'s lots more comfable being dirty.""\n\n""Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord,"" said Anne\nastutely.\n\nDavy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight\nhours; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving, whom he had\nheard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival. If Paul\nIrving washed his face every day, that settled it. He, Davy Keith,\nwould do it too, if it killed him. The same consideration induced him\nto submit meekly to the other details of his toilet, and he was really\na handsome little lad when all was done. Anne felt an almost maternal\npride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew.\n\nDavy behaved quite well at first, being occupied in casting covert\nglances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was\nPaul Irving. The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off\nuneventfully. Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came.\n\nLauretta White was sitting in front of Davy, her head slightly bent\nand her fair hair hanging in two long braids, between which a tempting\nexpanse of white neck showed, encased in a loose lace frill. Lauretta\nwas a fat, placid-looking child of eight, who had conducted herself\nirreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her\nthere, an infant of six months.\n\nDavy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced . . . a caterpillar, a\nfurry, squirming caterpillar. Marilla saw and clutched at him but she\nwas too late. Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta\'s neck.\n\nRight into the middle of Mr. Allan\'s prayer burst a series of piercing\nshrieks. The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes. Every head\nin the congregation flew up. Lauretta White was dancing up and down in\nher pew, clutching frantically at the back of her dress.\n\n""Ow . . . mommer . . . mommer . . . ow . . . take it off . . . ow . . .\nget it out . . . ow . . . that bad boy put it down my neck . . . ow . . .\nmommer . . . it\'s going further down . . . ow . . . ow . . . ow. . . .""\n\nMrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical, writhing\nLauretta out of church. Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr.\nAllan proceeded with the service. But everybody felt that it was a\nfailure that day. For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice\nof the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification.\n\nWhen they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for\nthe rest of the day. She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a\nplain tea of bread and milk. Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully\nby him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish. But Anne\'s mournful\neyes troubled him.\n\n""I s\'pose,"" he said reflectively, ""that Paul Irving wouldn\'t have\ndropped a caterpillar down a girl\'s neck in church, would he?""\n\n""Indeed he wouldn\'t,"" said Anne sadly.\n\n""Well, I\'m kind of sorry I did it, then,"" conceded Davy. ""But it was\nsuch a jolly big caterpillar . . . I picked him up on the church steps\njust as we went in. It seemed a pity to waste him. And say, wasn\'t it\nfun to hear that girl yell?""\n\nTuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables. Anne hurried home\nfrom school, for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she\ncould give. Dora, neat and proper, in her nicely starched white dress\nand black sash, was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor,\nspeaking demurely when spoken to, keeping silence when not, and in every\nway comporting herself as a model child. Davy, blissfully dirty, was\nmaking mud pies in the barnyard.\n\n""I told him he might,"" said Marilla wearily. ""I thought it would keep\nhim out of worse mischief. He can only get dirty at that. We\'ll have our\nteas over before we call him to his. Dora can have hers with us, but\nI would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids\nhere.""\n\nWhen Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in\nthe parlor. Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and\ncalled her out. A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted\nin a decision to let both children have their teas together later on.\n\nTea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure.\nMarilla and Anne stared in dismay, the Aids in amazement. Could that be\nDora . . . that sobbing nondescript in a drenched, dripping dress and hair\nfrom which the water was streaming on Marilla\'s new coin-spot rug?\n\n""Dora, what has happened to you?"" cried Anne, with a guilty glance at\nMrs. Jasper Bell, whose family was said to be the only one in the world\nin which accidents never occurred.\n\n""Davy made me walk the pigpen fence,"" wailed Dora. ""I didn\'t want to but\nhe called me a fraid-cat. And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress\ngot all dirty and the pig runned right over me. My dress was just awful\nbut Davy said if I\'d stand under the pump he\'d wash it clean, and I did\nand he pumped water all over me but my dress ain\'t a bit cleaner and my\npretty sash and shoes is all spoiled.""\n\nAnne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while\nMarilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes. Davy was\ncaught and sent to bed without any supper. Anne went to his room at\ntwilight and talked to him seriously . . . a method in which she had great\nfaith, not altogether unjustified by results. She told him she felt very\nbadly over his conduct.\n\n""I feel sorry now myself,"" admitted Davy, ""but the trouble is I never\nfeel sorry for doing things till after I\'ve did them. Dora wouldn\'t help\nme make pies, cause she was afraid of messing her clo\'es and that made\nme hopping mad. I s\'pose Paul Irving wouldn\'t have made HIS sister walk\na pigpen fence if he knew she\'d fall in?""\n\n""No, he would never dream of such a thing. Paul is a perfect little\ngentleman.""\n\nDavy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a\ntime. Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne\'s neck, snuggling\nhis flushed little face down on her shoulder.\n\n""Anne, don\'t you like me a little bit, even if I ain\'t a good boy like\nPaul?""\n\n""Indeed I do,"" said Anne sincerely. Somehow, it was impossible to help\nliking Davy. ""But I\'d like you better still if you weren\'t so naughty.""\n\n""I . . . did something else today,"" went on Davy in a muffled voice. ""I\'m\nsorry now but I\'m awful scared to tell you. You won\'t be very cross,\nwill you? And you won\'t tell Marilla, will you?""\n\n""I don\'t know, Davy. Perhaps I ought to tell her. But I think I can\npromise you I won\'t if you promise me that you will never do it again,\nwhatever it is.""\n\n""No, I never will. Anyhow, it\'s not likely I\'d find any more of them\nthis year. I found this one on the cellar steps.""\n\n""Davy, what is it you\'ve done?""\n\n""I put a toad in Marilla\'s bed. You can go and take it out if you like.\nBut say, Anne, wouldn\'t it be fun to leave it there?""\n\n""Davy Keith!"" Anne sprang from Davy\'s clinging arms and flew across the\nhall to Marilla\'s room. The bed was slightly rumpled. She threw back the\nblankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad, blinking\nat her from under a pillow.\n\n""How can I carry that awful thing out?"" moaned Anne with a shudder. The\nfire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while\nMarilla was busy in the pantry. Anne had her own troubles carrying that\ntoad downstairs, for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she\nthought she had lost it in the hall. When she finally deposited it in\nthe cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief.\n\n""If Marilla knew she\'d never feel safe getting into bed again in her\nlife. I\'m so glad that little sinner repented in time. There\'s Diana\nsignaling to me from her window. I\'m glad . . . I really feel the need of\nsome diversion, for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at\nhome my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day.""\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nA Question of Color\n\n\n""That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today, pestering me\nfor a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room,"" said\nMr. Harrison wrathfully. ""I detest that woman more than anybody I know.\nShe can put a whole sermon, text, comment, and application, into six\nwords, and throw it at you like a brick.""\n\nAnne, who was perched on the edge of the veranda, enjoying the charm\nof a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray\nNovember twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted\nfirs below the garden, turned her dreamy face over her shoulder.\n\n""The trouble is, you and Mrs. Lynde don\'t understand one another,"" she\nexplained. ""That is always what is wrong when people don\'t like each\nother. I didn\'t like Mrs. Lynde at first either; but as soon as I came\nto understand her I learned to.""\n\n""Mrs. Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks; but I didn\'t keep\non eating bananas because I was told I\'d learn to like them if I did,""\ngrowled Mr. Harrison. ""And as for understanding her, I understand that\nshe is a confirmed busybody and I told her so.""\n\n""Oh, that must have hurt her feelings very much,"" said Anne\nreproachfully. ""How could you say such a thing? I said some dreadful\nthings to Mrs. Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper. I\ncouldn\'t say them DELIBERATELY.""\n\n""It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody.""\n\n""But you don\'t tell the whole truth,"" objected Anne. ""You only tell the\ndisagreeable part of the truth. Now, you\'ve told me a dozen times that\nmy hair was red, but you\'ve never once told me that I had a nice nose.""\n\n""I daresay you know it without any telling,"" chuckled Mr. Harrison.\n\n""I know I have red hair too . . . although it\'s MUCH darker than it used\nto be . . . so there\'s no need of telling me that either.""\n\n""Well, well, I\'ll try and not mention it again since you\'re so\nsensitive. You must excuse me, Anne. I\'ve got a habit of being outspoken\nand folks mustn\'t mind it.""\n\n""But they can\'t help minding it. And I don\'t think it\'s any help\nthat it\'s your habit. What would you think of a person who went about\nsticking pins and needles into people and saying, \'Excuse me, you\nmustn\'t mind it . . . it\'s just a habit I\'ve got.\' You\'d think he was\ncrazy, wouldn\'t you? And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody, perhaps she\nis. But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the\npoor, and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter\nout of her dairy and told his wife he\'d bought it from her? Mrs. Cotton\ncast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and\nMrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly.""\n\n""I suppose she has some good qualities,"" conceded Mr. Harrison\ngrudgingly. ""Most folks have. I have some myself, though you might never\nsuspect it. But anyhow I ain\'t going to give anything to that carpet.\nFolks are everlasting begging for money here, it seems to me. How\'s your\nproject of painting the hall coming on?""\n\n""Splendidly. We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and\nfound that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and\nshingle the roof too. MOST people gave very liberally, Mr. Harrison.""\n\nAnne was a sweet-souled lass, but she could instill some venom into\ninnocent italics when occasion required.\n\n""What color are you going to have it?""\n\n""We have decided on a very pretty green. The roof will be dark red, of\ncourse. Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today.""\n\n""Who\'s got the job?""\n\n""Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody. He has nearly finished the shingling. We had\nto give him the contract, for every one of the Pyes . . .  and there are\nfour families, you know . . . said they wouldn\'t give a cent unless Joshua\ngot it. They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought\nthat was too much to lose, although some people think we shouldn\'t have\ngiven in to the Pyes. Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything.""\n\n""The main question is will this Joshua do his work well. If he does I\ndon\'t see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding.""\n\n""He has the reputation of being a good workman, though they say he\'s a\nvery peculiar man. He hardly ever talks.""\n\n""He\'s peculiar enough all right then,"" said Mr. Harrison drily. ""Or at\nleast, folks here will call him so. I never was much of a talker till\nI came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde\nwould have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught\nsign language. You\'re not going yet, Anne?""\n\n""I must. I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening. Besides, Davy\nis probably breaking Marilla\'s heart with some new mischief by this\ntime. This morning the first thing he said was, \'Where does the dark go,\nAnne? I want to know.\' I told him it went around to the other side of\nthe world but after breakfast he declared it didn\'t . . . that it went\ndown the well. Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box\nfour times today, trying to reach down to the dark.""\n\n""He\'s a limb,"" declared Mr. Harrison. ""He came over here yesterday and\npulled six feathers out of Ginger\'s tail before I could get in from the\nbarn. The poor bird has been moping ever since. Those children must be a\nsight of trouble to you folks.""\n\n""Everything that\'s worth having is some trouble,"" said Anne, secretly\nresolving to forgive Davy\'s next offence, whatever it might be, since he\nhad avenged her on Ginger.\n\nMr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye,\na surly, taciturn man, began painting the next day. He was not disturbed\nin his task. The hall was situated on what was called ""the lower road.""\nIn late autumn this road was always muddy and wet, and people going to\nCarmody traveled by the longer ""upper"" road. The hall was so closely\nsurrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it.\nMr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were\nso dear to his unsociable heart.\n\nFriday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody. Soon\nafter his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by, having braved the mud of\nthe lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its\nnew coat of paint. When she rounded the spruce curve she saw.\n\nThe sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly. She dropped the reins, held up her\nhands, and said ""Gracious Providence!"" She stared as if she could not\nbelieve her eyes. Then she laughed almost hysterically.\n\n""There must be some mistake . . . there must. I knew those Pyes would make\na mess of things.""\n\nMrs. Lynde drove home, meeting several people on the road and stopping\nto tell them about the hall. The news flew like wildfire. Gilbert\nBlythe, poring over a text book at home, heard it from his father\'s\nhired boy at sunset, and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables, joined on\nthe way by Fred Wright. They found Diana Barry, Jane Andrews, and Anne\nShirley, despair personified, at the yard gate of Green Gables, under\nthe big leafless willows.\n\n""It isn\'t true surely, Anne?"" exclaimed Gilbert.\n\n""It is true,"" answered Anne, looking like the muse of tragedy. ""Mrs.\nLynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me. Oh, it is simply\ndreadful! What is the use of trying to improve anything?""\n\n""What is dreadful?"" asked Oliver Sloane, arriving at this moment with a\nbandbox he had brought from town for Marilla.\n\n""Haven\'t you heard?"" said Jane wrathfully. ""Well, its simply this. . .\nJoshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green. . .\na deep, brilliant blue, the shade they use for painting carts and\nwheelbarrows. And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a\nbuilding, especially when combined with a red roof, that she ever saw\nor imagined. You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I\nheard it. It\'s heartbreaking, after all the trouble we\'ve had.""\n\n""How on earth could such a mistake have happened?"" wailed Diana.\n\nThe blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to\nthe Pyes. The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and\nthe Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card.\nA purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying\nnumber. Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye\nsent word to the Improvers by his son, John Andrew, that he was going to\ntown and would get their paint for them, the Improvers told John Andrew\nto tell his father to get 147. John Andrew always averred that he did\nso, but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him\n157; and there the matter stands to this day.\n\nThat night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an\nImprover lived. The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it\nquenched even Davy. Anne wept and would not be comforted.\n\n""I must cry, even if I am almost seventeen, Marilla,"" she sobbed. ""It\nis so mortifying. And it sounds the death knell of our society. We\'ll\nsimply be laughed out of existence.""\n\nIn life, as in dreams, however, things often go by contraries. The\nAvonlea people did not laugh; they were too angry. Their money had\ngone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly\naggrieved by the mistake. Public indignation centered on the Pyes. Roger\nPye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them; and as for\nJoshua Pye, he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something\nwrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint. Joshua\nPye, when thus animadverted upon, retorted that the Avonlea taste in\ncolors was no business of his, whatever his private opinion might be; he\nhad been hired to paint the hall, not to talk about it; and he meant to\nhave his money for it.\n\nThe Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit, after\nconsulting Mr. Peter Sloane, who was a magistrate.\n\n""You\'ll have to pay it,"" Peter told him. ""You can\'t hold him responsible\nfor the mistake, since he claims he was never told what the color was\nsupposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead. But it\'s a\nburning shame and that hall certainly does look awful.""\n\nThe luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced\nthan ever against them; but instead, public sympathy veered around in\ntheir favor. People thought the eager, enthusiastic little band who had\nworked so hard for their object had been badly used. Mrs. Lynde told\nthem to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the\nworld who could do things without making a muddle of them. Mr. Major\nSpencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the\nroad front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense;\nand Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne\nmysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the ""Sassiety""\nwanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they\nneedn\'t be afraid of her cow, for she would see that the marauding\nanimal was kept within safe bounds. Even Mr. Harrison chuckled, if he\nchuckled at all, in private, and was all sympathy outwardly.\n\n""Never mind, Anne. Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is\nas ugly as it can be to begin with, so it\'s bound to fade prettier. And\nthe roof is shingled and painted all right. Folks will be able to sit in\nthe hall after this without being leaked on. You\'ve accomplished so much\nanyhow.""\n\n""But Avonlea\'s blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring\nsettlements from this time out,"" said Anne bitterly.\n\nAnd it must be confessed that it was.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nDavy in Search of a Sensation\n\n\nAnne, walking home from school through the Birch Path one November\nafternoon, felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing.\nThe day had been a good day; all had gone well in her little kingdom.\nSt. Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question\nof his name; Prillie Rogerson\'s face had been so puffed up from the\neffects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the\nboys in her vicinity. Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident . . .\nspilling a dipper of water over the floor . . . and Anthony Pye had not\nbeen in school at all.\n\n""What a nice month this November has been!"" said Anne, who had never\nquite got over her childish habit of talking to herself. ""November is\nusually such a disagreeable month . . . as if the year had suddenly found\nout that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over\nit. This year is growing old gracefully . . . just like a stately old lady\nwho knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles. We\'ve\nhad lovely days and delicious twilights. This last fortnight has been so\npeaceful, and even Davy has been almost well-behaved. I really think\nhe is improving a great deal. How quiet the woods are today . . .  not\na murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops! It sounds like\nsurf on a faraway shore. How dear the woods are! You beautiful trees! I\nlove every one of you as a friend.""\n\nAnne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its\ncream-white trunk. Diana, rounding a curve in the path, saw her and\nlaughed.\n\n""Anne Shirley, you\'re only pretending to be grown up. I believe when\nyou\'re alone you\'re as much a little girl as you ever were.""\n\n""Well, one can\'t get over the habit of being a little girl all at once,""\nsaid Anne gaily. ""You see, I was little for fourteen years and I\'ve only\nbeen grown-uppish for scarcely three. I\'m sure I shall always feel like\na child in the woods. These walks home from school are almost the only\ntime I have for dreaming . . .  except the half-hour or so before I go to\nsleep. I\'m so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with\nthe twins that I haven\'t another moment for imagining things. You don\'t\nknow what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to\nbed in the east gable every night. I always imagine I\'m something very\nbrilliant and triumphant and splendid . . .  a great prima donna or a Red\nCross nurse or a queen. Last night I was a queen. It\'s really splendid\nto imagine you are a queen. You have all the fun of it without any of\nthe inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to,\nwhich you couldn\'t in real life. But here in the woods I like best to\nimagine quite different things . . . I\'m a dryad living in an old pine, or\na little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf. That white birch\nyou caught me kissing is a sister of mine. The only difference is, she\'s\na tree and I\'m a girl, but that\'s no real difference. Where are you\ngoing, Diana?""\n\n""Down to the Dicksons. I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress.\nCan\'t you walk down in the evening, Anne, and come home with me?""\n\n""I might . . . since Fred Wright is away in town,"" said Anne with a rather\ntoo innocent face.\n\nDiana blushed, tossed her head, and walked on. She did not look\noffended, however.\n\nAnne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons\' that evening, but she\ndid not. When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs\nwhich banished every other thought from her mind. Marilla met her in the\nyard . . . a wild-eyed Marilla.\n\n""Anne, Dora is lost!""\n\n""Dora! Lost!"" Anne looked at Davy, who was swinging on the yard gate,\nand detected merriment in his eyes. ""Davy, do you know where she is?""\n\n""No, I don\'t,"" said Davy stoutly. ""I haven\'t seen her since dinner time,\ncross my heart.""\n\n""I\'ve been away ever since one o\'clock,"" said Marilla. ""Thomas Lynde\ntook sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once. When\nI left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was\nmaking mud pies behind the barn. I only got home half an hour ago . . .\nand no Dora to be seen. Davy declares he never saw her since I left.""\n\n""Neither I did,"" avowed Davy solemnly.\n\n""She must be somewhere around,"" said Anne. ""She would never wander far\naway alone . . . you know how timid she is. Perhaps she has fallen asleep\nin one of the rooms.""\n\nMarilla shook her head.\n\n""I\'ve hunted the whole house through. But she may be in some of the\nbuildings.""\n\nA thorough search followed. Every corner of house, yard, and\noutbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people. Anne roved\nthe orchards and the Haunted Wood, calling Dora\'s name. Marilla took a\ncandle and explored the cellar. Davy accompanied each of them in turn,\nand was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be.\nFinally they met again in the yard.\n\n""It\'s a most mysterious thing,"" groaned Marilla.\n\n""Where can she be?"" said Anne miserably\n\n""Maybe she\'s tumbled into the well,"" suggested Davy cheerfully.\n\nAnne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other\'s eyes. The thought\nhad been with them both through their entire search but neither had\ndared to put it into words.\n\n""She . . . she might have,"" whispered Marilla.\n\nAnne, feeling faint and sick, went to the wellbox and peered over. The\nbucket sat on the shelf inside. Far down below was a tiny glimmer of\nstill water. The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea. If Dora. . .\nbut Anne could not face the idea. She shuddered and turned away.\n\n""Run across for Mr. Harrison,"" said Marilla, wringing her hands.\n\n""Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away . . . they went to town today.\nI\'ll go for Mr. Barry.""\n\nMr. Barry came back with Anne, carrying a coil of rope to which was\nattached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a\ngrubbing fork. Marilla and Anne stood by, cold and shaken with horror\nand dread, while Mr. Barry dragged the well, and Davy, astride the gate,\nwatched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment.\n\nFinally Mr. Barry shook his head, with a relieved air.\n\n""She can\'t be down there. It\'s a mighty curious thing where she could\nhave got to, though. Look here, young man, are you sure you\'ve no idea\nwhere your sister is?""\n\n""I\'ve told you a dozen times that I haven\'t,"" said Davy, with an injured\nair. ""Maybe a tramp come and stole her.""\n\n""Nonsense,"" said Marilla sharply, relieved from her horrible fear of\nthe well. ""Anne, do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr.\nHarrison\'s? She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that\ntime you took her over.""\n\n""I can\'t believe Dora would venture so far alone but I\'ll go over and\nsee,"" said Anne.\n\nNobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a\nvery decided change came over his face. He quietly slipped off the gate\nand ran, as fast as his fat legs could carry him, to the barn.\n\nAnne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no\nvery hopeful frame of mind. The house was locked, the window shades\nwere down, and there was no sign of anything living about the place. She\nstood on the veranda and called Dora loudly.\n\nGinger, in the kitchen behind her, shrieked and swore with sudden\nfierceness; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry\nfrom the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a\ntoolhouse. Anne flew to the door, unhasped it, and caught up a small\nmortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned\nnail keg.\n\n""Oh, Dora, Dora, what a fright you have given us! How came you to be\nhere?""\n\n""Davy and I came over to see Ginger,"" sobbed Dora, ""but we couldn\'t see\nhim after all, only Davy made him swear by kicking the door. And then\nDavy brought me here and run out and shut the door; and I couldn\'t get\nout. I cried and cried, I was frightened, and oh, I\'m so hungry and\ncold; and I thought you\'d never come, Anne.""\n\n""Davy?"" But Anne could say no more. She carried Dora home with a heavy\nheart. Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in\nthe pain caused by Davy\'s behavior. The freak of shutting Dora up might\neasily have been pardoned. But Davy had told falsehoods . . . downright\ncoldblooded falsehoods about it. That was the ugly fact and Anne could\nnot shut her eyes to it. She could have sat down and cried with sheer\ndisappointment. She had grown to love Davy dearly . . . how dearly she had\nnot known until this minute . . . and it hurt her unbearably to discover\nthat he was guilty of deliberate falsehood.\n\nMarilla listened to Anne\'s tale in a silence that boded no good\nDavy-ward; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt\nwith. When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing,\nshivering Dora, got her her supper and put her to bed. Then she returned\nto the kitchen, just as Marilla came grimly in, leading, or rather\npulling, the reluctant, cobwebby Davy, whom she had just found hidden\naway in the darkest corner of the stable.\n\nShe jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and\nsat down by the east window. Anne was sitting limply by the west window.\nBetween them stood the culprit. His back was toward Marilla and it was\na meek, subdued, frightened back; but his face was toward Anne and\nalthough it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship\nin Davy\'s eyes, as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be\npunished for it, but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later\non.\n\nBut no half hidden smile answered him in Anne\'s gray eyes, as there\nmight have done had it been only a question of mischief. There was\nsomething else . . . something ugly and repulsive.\n\n""How could you behave so, Davy?"" she asked sorrowfully.\n\nDavy squirmed uncomfortably.\n\n""I just did it for fun. Things have been so awful quiet here for so long\nthat I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare. It was,\ntoo.""\n\nIn spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the\nrecollection.\n\n""But you told a falsehood about it, Davy,"" said Anne, more sorrowfully\nthan ever.\n\nDavy looked puzzled.\n\n""What\'s a falsehood? Do you mean a whopper?""\n\n""I mean a story that was not true.""\n\n""Course I did,"" said Davy frankly. ""If I hadn\'t you wouldn\'t have been\nscared. I HAD to tell it.""\n\nAnne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions. Davy\'s\nimpenitent attitude gave the finishing touch. Two big tears brimmed up\nin her eyes.\n\n""Oh, Davy, how could you?"" she said, with a quiver in her voice. ""Don\'t\nyou know how wrong it was?""\n\nDavy was aghast. Anne crying . . . he had made Anne cry! A flood of real\nremorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it.\nHe rushed to Anne, hurled himself into her lap, flung his arms around\nher neck, and burst into tears.\n\n""I didn\'t know it was wrong to tell whoppers,"" he sobbed. ""How did you\nexpect me to know it was wrong? All Mr. Sprott\'s children told them\nREGULAR every day, and cross their hearts too. I s\'pose Paul Irving\nnever tells whoppers and here I\'ve been trying awful hard to be as good\nas him, but now I s\'pose you\'ll never love me again. But I think you\nmight have told me it was wrong. I\'m awful sorry I\'ve made you cry,\nAnne, and I\'ll never tell a whopper again.""\n\nDavy buried his face in Anne\'s shoulder and cried stormily. Anne, in a\nsudden glad flash of understanding, held him tight and looked over his\ncurly thatch at Marilla.\n\n""He didn\'t know it was wrong to tell falsehoods, Marilla. I think we\nmust forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never\nto say what isn\'t true again.""\n\n""I never will, now that I know it\'s bad,"" asseverated Davy between sobs.\n""If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can . . ."" Davy groped\nmentally for a suitable penance . . . ""you can skin me alive, Anne.""\n\n""Don\'t say \'whopper,\' Davy . . . say \'falsehood,\'"" said the schoolma\'am.\n\n""Why?"" queried Davy, settling comfortably down and looking up with\na tearstained, investigating face. ""Why ain\'t whopper as good as\nfalsehood? I want to know. It\'s just as big a word.""\n\n""It\'s slang; and it\'s wrong for little boys to use slang.""\n\n""There\'s an awful lot of things it\'s wrong to do,"" said Davy with a\nsigh. ""I never s\'posed there was so many. I\'m sorry it\'s wrong to tell\nwhop . . .  falsehoods, \'cause it\'s awful handy, but since it is I\'m never\ngoing to tell any more. What are you going to do to me for telling them\nthis time? I want to know."" Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla.\n\n""I don\'t want to be too hard on the child,"" said Marilla. ""I daresay\nnobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies, and those Sprott\nchildren were no fit companions for him. Poor Mary was too sick to train\nhim properly and I presume you couldn\'t expect a six-year-old child to\nknow things like that by instinct. I suppose we\'ll just have to assume\nhe doesn\'t know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning. But he\'ll\nhave to be punished for shutting Dora up, and I can\'t think of any way\nexcept to send him to bed without his supper and we\'ve done that so\noften. Can\'t you suggest something else, Anne? I should think you ought\nto be able to, with that imagination you\'re always talking of.""\n\n""But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant\nthings,"" said Anne, cuddling Davy. ""There are so many unpleasant things\nin the world already that there is no use in imagining any more.""\n\nIn the end Davy was sent to bed, as usual, there to remain until noon\nnext day. He evidently did some thinking, for when Anne went up to her\nroom a little later she heard him calling her name softly. Going in, she\nfound him sitting up in bed, with his elbows on his knees and his chin\npropped on his hands.\n\n""Anne,"" he said solemnly, ""is it wrong for everybody to tell whop . . .\nfalsehoods? I want to know?""\n\n""Yes, indeed.""\n\n""Is it wrong for a grown-up person?""\n\n""Yes.""\n\n""Then,"" said Davy decidedly, ""Marilla is bad, for SHE tells them. And\nshe\'s worse\'n me, for I didn\'t know it was wrong but she does.""\n\n""Davy Keith, Marilla never told a story in her life,"" said Anne\nindignantly.\n\n""She did so. She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD\nhappen to me if I didn\'t say my prayers every night. And I haven\'t said\nthem for over a week, just to see what would happen . . .  and nothing\nhas,"" concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone.\n\nAnne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would\nbe fatal, and then earnestly set about saving Marilla\'s reputation.\n\n""Why, Davy Keith,"" she said solemnly, ""something dreadful HAS happened\nto you this very day.""\n\nDavy looked sceptical.\n\n""I s\'pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper,"" he said\nscornfully, ""but THAT isn\'t dreadful. Course, I don\'t like it, but I\'ve\nbeen sent to bed so much since I come here that I\'m getting used to it.\nAnd you don\'t save anything by making me go without supper either, for I\nalways eat twice as much for breakfast.""\n\n""I don\'t mean your being sent to bed. I mean the fact that you told a\nfalsehood today. And, Davy,"" . . . Anne leaned over the footboard of the\nbed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit . . . ""for a boy to\ntell what isn\'t true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him\n. . . almost the very worst. So you see Marilla told you the truth.""\n\n""But I thought the something bad would be exciting,"" protested Davy in\nan injured tone.\n\n""Marilla isn\'t to blame for what you thought. Bad things aren\'t always\nexciting. They\'re very often just nasty and stupid.""\n\n""It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well,\nthough,"" said Davy, hugging his knees.\n\nAnne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed\non the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached.\n\n""I wish you\'d tell me the joke,"" said Marilla, a little grimly. ""I\nhaven\'t seen much to laugh at today.""\n\n""You\'ll laugh when you hear this,"" assured Anne. And Marilla did laugh,\nwhich showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of\nAnne. But she sighed immediately afterwards.\n\n""I suppose I shouldn\'t have told him that, although I heard a minister\nsay it to a child once. But he did aggravate me so. It was that night\nyou were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed. He said\nhe didn\'t see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some\nimportance to God. Anne, I do not know what we are going to do with that\nchild. I never saw his beat. I\'m feeling clean discouraged.""\n\n""Oh, don\'t say that, Marilla. Remember how bad I was when I came here.""\n\n""Anne, you never were bad . . . NEVER. I see that now, when I\'ve learned\nwhat real badness is. You were always getting into terrible scrapes,\nI\'ll admit, but your motive was always good. Davy is just bad from sheer\nlove of it.""\n\n""Oh, no, I don\'t think it is real badness with him either,"" pleaded\nAnne. ""It\'s just mischief. And it is rather quiet for him here, you\nknow. He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have\nsomething to occupy it. Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for\na boy\'s playmate. I really think it would be better to let them go to\nschool, Marilla.""\n\n""No,"" said Marilla resolutely, ""my father always said that no child\nshould be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven\nyears old, and Mr. Allan says the same thing. The twins can have a few\nlessons at home but go to school they shan\'t till they\'re seven.""\n\n""Well, we must try to reform Davy at home then,"" said Anne cheerfully.\n""With all his faults he\'s really a dear little chap. I can\'t help loving\nhim. Marilla, it may be a dreadful thing to say, but honestly, I like\nDavy better than Dora, for all she\'s so good.""\n\n""I don\'t know but that I do, myself,"" confessed Marilla, ""and it isn\'t\nfair, for Dora isn\'t a bit of trouble. There couldn\'t be a better child\nand you\'d hardly know she was in the house.""\n\n""Dora is too good,"" said Anne. ""She\'d behave just as well if there\nwasn\'t a soul to tell her what to do. She was born already brought up,\nso she doesn\'t need us; and I think,"" concluded Anne, hitting on a very\nvital truth, ""that we always love best the people who need us. Davy\nneeds us badly.""\n\n""He certainly needs something,"" agreed Marilla. ""Rachel Lynde would say\nit was a good spanking.""\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nFacts and Fancies\n\n\n""Teaching is really very interesting work,"" wrote Anne to a Queen\'s\nAcademy chum. ""Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I don\'t find it\nso. Something funny is almost sure to happen every day, and the children\nsay such amusing things. Jane says she punishes her pupils when\nthey make funny speeches, which is probably why she finds teaching\nmonotonous. This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell\n\'speckled\' and couldn\'t manage it. \'Well,\' he said finally, \'I can\'t\nspell it but I know what it means.\'\n\n""\'What?\' I asked.\n\n""\'St. Clair Donnell\'s face, miss.\'\n\n""St. Clair is certainly very much freckled, although I try to prevent\nthe others from commenting on it . . . for I was freckled once and well do\nI remember it. But I don\'t think St. Clair minds. It was because Jimmy\ncalled him \'St. Clair\' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from\nschool. I heard of the pounding, but not officially, so I don\'t think\nI\'ll take any notice of it.\n\n""Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition. I said,\n\'If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other, how many\nwould you have altogether?\' \'A mouthful,\' said Lottie. And in the\nnature study class, when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads\nshouldn\'t be killed, Benjie Sloane gravely answered, \'Because it would\nrain the next day.\'\n\n""It\'s so hard not to laugh, Stella. I have to save up all my amusement\nuntil I get home, and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild\nshrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent\ncause. She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it\nbegan.\n\n""Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE? Rose Bell\nsays he was . . . also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament.\nClaude White says a \'glacier\' is a man who puts in window frames!\n\n""I think the most difficult thing in teaching, as well as the most\ninteresting, is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts\nabout things. One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at\ndinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of\nthemselves. I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted. Some\nof the answers were commonplace enough  . . .  dolls, ponies, and skates.\nOthers were decidedly original. Hester Boulter wanted \'to wear her\nSunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room.\' Hannah Bell wanted\n\'to be good without having to take any trouble about it.\' Marjory White,\naged ten, wanted to be a WIDOW. Questioned why, she gravely said that if\nyou weren\'t married people called you an old maid, and if you were your\nhusband bossed you; but if you were a widow there\'d be no danger\nof either. The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell\'s. She wanted a\n\'honeymoon.\' I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she\nthought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in\nMontreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had\nthe very latest in bicycles!\n\n""Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had\never done. I couldn\'t get the older ones to do so, but the third class\nanswered quite freely. Eliza Bell had \'set fire to her aunt\'s carded\nrolls.\' Asked if she meant to do it she said, \'not altogether.\' She just\ntried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed\nup in a jiffy. Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he\nshould have put it in his missionary box. Annetta Bell\'s worst crime was\n\'eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard.\' Willie White had\n\'slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers\non.\' \'But I was punished for it \'cause I had to wear patched pants to\nSunday School all summer, and when you\'re punished for a thing you don\'t\nhave to repent of it,\' declared Willie.\n\n""I wish you could see some of their compositions . . . so much do I wish\nit that I\'ll send you copies of some written recently. Last week I told\nthe fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they\npleased, adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some\nplace they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had\nseen. They were to write the letters on real note paper, seal them in an\nenvelope, and address them to me, all without any assistance from other\npeople. Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and\nthat evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well\nas its pains. Those compositions would atone for much. Here is Ned\nClay\'s, address, spelling, and grammar as originally penned.\n\n""\'Miss teacher ShiRley\n\nGreen gabels.\n\np.e. Island can\n\nbirds\n\n\n""\'Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds. birds\nis very useful animals. my cat catches birds. His name is William but pa\ncalls him tom. he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of\nlast winter. only for that he would be a good-looking cat. My unkle\nhas adopted a cat. it come to his house one day and woudent go away and\nunkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed. he lets it\nsleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he\ndoes of his children. that is not right. we ought to be kind to cats\nand give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our\nchildren. this is oll I can think of so no more at present from\n\nedward blake ClaY.\'""\n\n\n""St. Clair Donnell\'s is, as usual, short and to the point. St. Clair\nnever wastes words. I do not think he chose his subject or added the\npostscript out of malice aforethought. It is just that he has not a\ngreat deal of tact or imagination.""\n\n\n""\'Dear Miss Shirley\n\n""\'You told us to describe something strange we have seen. I will describe\nthe Avonlea Hall. It has two doors, an inside one and an outside one.\nIt has six windows and a chimney. It has two ends and two sides. It is\npainted blue. That is what makes it strange. It is built on the lower\nCarmody road. It is the third most important building in Avonlea. The\nothers are the church and the blacksmith shop. They hold debating clubs\nand lectures in it and concerts.\n\n""\'Yours truly,\n\n""\'Jacob Donnell.\n\n""\'P.S. The hall is a very bright blue.\'""\n\n\n""Annetta Bell\'s letter was quite long, which surprised me, for writing\nessays is not Annetta\'s forte, and hers are generally as brief as St.\nClair\'s. Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior,\nbut there isn\'t a shadow of orginality in her. Here is her letter.--\n\n""\'Dearest teacher,\n\n""""I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you. I\nlove you with my whole heart and soul and mind . . . with all there is of\nme to love . . . and I want to serve you for ever. It would be my highest\nprivilege. That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my\nlessuns.\n\n""\'You are so beautiful, my teacher. Your voice is like music and your\neyes are like pansies when the dew is on them.

I knew Annetta\ncouldn\'t have composed it any more than she could fly. When I went to\nschool the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess\nand asked her to tell me the truth about the letter. Annetta cried\nand \'fessed up freely. She said she had never written a letter and she\ndidn\'t know how to, or what to say, but there was bundle of love letters\nin her mother\'s top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an\nold \'beau.\'\n\n""\'It wasn\'t father,\' sobbed Annetta, \'it was someone who was studying\nfor a minister, and so he could write lovely letters, but ma didn\'t\nmarry him after all. She said she couldn\'t make out what he was driving\nat half the time. But I thought the letters were sweet and that I\'d just\ncopy things out of them here and there to write you. I put ""teacher""\nwhere he put ""lady"" and I put in something of my own when I could think\nof it and I changed some words. I put ""dress"" in place of ""mood."" I\ndidn\'t know just what a ""mood"" was but I s\'posed it was something to\nwear. I didn\'t s\'pose you\'d know the difference. I don\'t see how you\nfound out it wasn\'t all mine. You must be awful clever, teacher.\'\n\n""I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person\'s letter and\npass it off as her own. But I\'m afraid that all Annetta repented of was\nbeing found out.\n\n""\'And I do love you, teacher,\' she sobbed. \'It was all true, even if the\nminister wrote it first. I do love you with all my heart.\'\n\n""It\'s very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances.\n\n""Here is Barbara Shaw\'s letter. I can\'t reproduce the blots of the\noriginal.\n\n""\'Dear teacher,\n\n""""You said we might write about a visit. I never visited but once. It was\nat my Aunt Mary\'s last winter. My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman\nand a great housekeeper. The first night I was there we were at tea.\nI knocked over a jug and broke it. Aunt Mary said she had had that jug\never since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before. When we\ngot up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt.\nThe next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin\nand cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at\nbreakfast. When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I\ndropped a china plate and it smashed. That evening I fell downstairs and\nsprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week. I heard Aunt Mary\ntell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I\'d have broken everything in the\nhouse. When I got better it was time to go home. I don\'t like visiting\nvery much. I like going to school better, especially since I came to\nAvonlea.\n\n""\'Yours respectfully,\n\n""""Barbara Shaw.\'""\n\n\n""Willie White\'s began,\n\n""""Respected Miss,\n\n""""I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt. She lives in Ontario and\none day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard. The dog had\nno business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him\ninto the barn and shut him up. Pretty soon a man came looking for an\ninaginary lion\' (Query;--Did Willie mean a menagerie lion?) \'that had\nrun away from a circus. And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my\nVery Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick. It was a wonder\nshe was not et up but she was very brave. Emerson Gillis says if she\nthought it was a dog she wasn\'t any braver than if it really was a\ndog. But Emerson is jealous because he hasn\'t got a Brave Aunt himself,\nnothing but uncles.\'\n\n""\'I have kept the best for the last. You laugh at me because I think Paul\nis a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very\nuncommon child. Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother\nand he has no playmates . . . no real playmates. You remember our School\nManagement professor told us that we must not have \'favorites\' among\nour pupils, but I can\'t help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine.\nI don\'t think it does any harm, though, for everybody loves Paul, even\nMrs. Lynde, who says she could never have believed she\'d get so fond of\na Yankee. The other boys in school like him too. There is nothing weak\nor girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies. He is very\nmanly and can hold his own in all games. He fought St. Clair Donnell\nrecently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the\nStars and Stripes as a flag. The result was a drawn battle and a mutual\nagreement to respect each other\'s patriotism henceforth. St. Clair says\nhe can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST.\'""\n\n\n""Paul\'s Letter.\n\n""\'My dear teacher,\n\n""\'You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew. I\nthink the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean\nto tell you about them. I have never told anybody about them except\ngrandma and father but I would like to have you know about them\nbecause you understand things. There are a great many people who do not\nunderstand things so there is no use in telling them.\'\n\n""\'My rock people live at the shore. I used to visit them almost every\nevening before the winter came. Now I can\'t go till spring, but they\nwill be there, for people like that never change . . . that is the\nsplendid thing about them. Nora was the first one of them I got\nacquainted with and so I think I love her the best. She lives in\nAndrews\' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes, and she knows all\nabout the mermaids and the water kelpies. You ought to hear the stories\nshe can tell. Then there are the Twin Sailors. They don\'t live anywhere,\nthey sail all the time, but they often come ashore to talk to me. They\nare a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world. . .\nand more than what is in the world. Do you know what happened to the\nyoungest Twin Sailor once? He was sailing and he sailed right into a\nmoonglade. A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water\nwhen it is rising from the sea, you know, teacher. Well, the youngest\nTwin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the\nmoon, and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it\nand sailed right through. He had some wonderful adventures in the moon\nbut it would make this letter too long to tell them.\'\n\n""\'Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave. One day I found a big cave\ndown on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the\nGolden Lady. She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress\nis all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive. And she has a\ngolden harp and plays on it all day long . . . you can hear the music any\ntime along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it\nwas only the wind among the rocks. I\'ve never told Nora about the Golden\nLady. I was afraid it might hurt her feelings. It even hurt her feelings\nif I talked too long with the Twin Sailors.\'\n\n""\'I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks. The youngest\nTwin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look\ndreadfully fierce at times. I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin.\nI believe he\'d be a pirate if he dared. There\'s really something very\nmysterious about him. He swore once and I told him if he ever did\nit again he needn\'t come ashore to talk to me because I\'d promised\ngrandmother I\'d never associate with anybody that swore. He was pretty\nwell scared, I can tell you, and he said if I would forgive him he would\ntake me to the sunset. So the next evening when I was sitting on the\nStriped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted\nboat and I got in her. The boat was all pearly and rainbowy, like the\ninside of the mussel shells, and her sail was like moonshine. Well, we\nsailed right across to the sunset. Think of that, teacher, I\'ve been\nin the sunset. And what do you suppose it is? The sunset is a land\nall flowers. We sailed into a great garden, and the clouds are beds of\nflowers. We sailed into a great harbor, all the color of gold, and\nI stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with\nbuttercups as big as roses. I stayed there for ever so long. It seemed\nnearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes. You\nsee, in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here.\'\n\n""\'Your loving pupil Paul Irving.\'\n\n""\'P. S. of course, this letter isn\'t really true, teacher. P.I.\'""\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nA Jonah Day\n\n\nIt really began the night before with a restless, wakeful vigil of\ngrumbling toothache. When Anne arose in the dull, bitter winter morning\nshe felt that life was flat, stale, and unprofitable.\n\nShe went to school in no angelic mood. Her cheek was swollen and her\nface ached. The schoolroom was cold and smoky, for the fire refused to\nburn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups. Anne\nsent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used\nbefore. Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger\nand she saw him whisper something to his seat-mate and then glance at\nher with a grin.\n\nNever, so it seemed to Anne, had there been so many squeaky pencils as\nthere were that morning; and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with\na sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results.\nThe coal rolled to every part of the room, her slate was broken into\nfragments, and when she picked herself up, her face, stained with coal\ndust, sent the boys into roars of laughter.\n\nAnne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing.\n\n""Really, Barbara,"" she said icily, ""if you cannot move without falling\nover something you\'d better remain in your seat. It is positively\ndisgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward.""\n\nPoor Barbara stumbled back to her desk, her tears combining with the\ncoal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque. Never before had her\nbeloved, sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion,\nand Barbara was heartbroken. Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but\nit only served to increase her mental irritation, and the second reader\nclass remember that lesson yet, as well as the unmerciful infliction\nof arithmetic that followed. Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St.\nClair Donnell arrived breathlessly.\n\n""You are half an hour late, St. Clair,"" Anne reminded him frigidly. ""Why\nis this?""\n\n""Please, miss, I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner \'cause we\'re\nexpecting company and Clarice Almira\'s sick,"" was St. Clair\'s answer,\ngiven in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of\ngreat mirth among his mates.\n\n""Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty-four of\nyour arithmetic for punishment,"" said Anne. St. Clair looked rather\namazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his\nslate. Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the\naisle. Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about\nthat parcel.\n\nOld Mrs. Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling ""nut cakes""\nby way of adding to her scanty income. The cakes were specially tempting\nto small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in\nregard to them. On their way to school the boys would invest their spare\ncash at Mrs. Hiram\'s, bring the cakes along with them to school, and, if\npossible, eat them and treat their mates during school hours. Anne had\nwarned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be\nconfiscated; and yet here was St. Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel\nof them, wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs. Hiram used,\nunder her very eyes.\n\n""Joseph,"" said Anne quietly, ""bring that parcel here.""\n\nJoe, startled and abashed, obeyed. He was a fat urchin who always\nblushed and stuttered when he was frightened. Never did anybody look\nmore guilty than poor Joe at that moment.\n\n""Throw it into the fire,"" said Anne.\n\nJoe looked very blank.\n\n""P . . . p . . . p . . . lease, m . . . m . . . miss,"" he began.\n\n""Do as I tell you, Joseph, without any words about it.""\n\n""B . . . b . . . but m . . . m . . . miss . . . th . . . th . . .\nthey\'re . . ."" gasped Joe in desperation.\n\n""Joseph, are you going to obey me or are you NOT?"" said Anne.\n\nA bolder and more self-possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been\noverawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes. This was a new\nAnne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before. Joe, with an agonized\nglance at St. Clair, went to the stove, opened the big, square front\ndoor, and threw the blue and white parcel in, before St. Clair, who\nhad sprung to his feet, could utter a word. Then he dodged back just in\ntime.\n\nFor a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know\nwhether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred.\nThe innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain\nMrs. Hiram\'s nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers\nand pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St.\nClair Donnell\'s father the day before, intending to have a birthday\ncelebration that evening. The crackers went off in a thunderclap of\nnoise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the\nroom, hissing and spluttering. Anne dropped into her chair white with\ndismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks. Joe Sloane\nstood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St. Clair,\nhelpless with laughter, rocked to and fro in the aisle. Prillie Rogerson\nfainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics.\n\nIt seemed a long time, although it was really only a few minutes, before\nthe last pinwheel subsided. Anne, recovering herself, sprang to open\ndoors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room.\nThen she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch,\nwhere Barbara Shaw, in an agony of desire to be useful, poured a pailful\nof half frozen water over Prillie\'s face and shoulders before anyone\ncould stop her.\n\nIt was a full hour before quiet was restored  . . . but it was a quiet\nthat might be felt. Everybody realized that even the explosion had not\ncleared the teacher\'s mental atmosphere. Nobody, except Anthony Pye,\ndared whisper a word. Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while\nworking a sum, caught Anne\'s eye and wished the floor would open and\nswallow him up. The geography class were whisked through a continent\nwith a speed that made them dizzy. The grammar class were parsed\nand analyzed within an inch of their lives. Chester Sloane, spelling\n""odoriferous"" with two f\'s, was made to feel that he could never live\ndown the disgrace of it, either in this world or that which is to come.\n\nAnne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident\nwould be laughed over that night at a score of tea-tables, but the\nknowledge only angered her further. In a calmer mood she could have\ncarried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible; so\nshe ignored it in icy disdain.\n\nWhen Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were\nas usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk\nexcept Anthony Pye\'s. He peered across his book at Anne, his black eyes\nsparkling with curiosity and mockery. Anne twitched open the drawer\nof her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse\nsprang out of the drawer, scampered over the desk, and leaped to the\nfloor.\n\nAnne screamed and sprang back, as if it had been a snake, and Anthony\nPye laughed aloud.\n\nThen a silence fell . . . a very creepy, uncomfortable silence. Annetta\nBell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not,\nespecially as she didn\'t know just where the mouse had gone. But she\ndecided not to. Who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a\nteacher so white-faced and so blazing-eyed standing before one?\n\n""Who put that mouse in my desk?"" said Anne. Her voice was quite low but\nit made a shiver go up and down Paul Irving\'s spine. Joe Sloane caught\nher eye, felt responsible from the crown of his head to the sole of his\nfeet, but stuttered out wildly,\n\n""N . . . n . . . not m . . . m . . . me t . . . t . . . teacher, n . . .\nn . . . not m . . . m . . . me.""\n\nAnne paid no attention to the wretched Joseph. She looked at Anthony\nPye, and Anthony Pye looked back unabashed and unashamed.\n\n""Anthony, was it you?""\n\n""Yes, it was,"" said Anthony insolently.\n\nAnne took her pointer from her desk. It was a long, heavy hardwood\npointer.\n\n""Come here, Anthony.""\n\nIt was far from being the most severe punishment Anthony Pye had ever\nundergone. Anne, even the stormy-souled Anne she was at that moment,\ncould not have punished any child cruelly. But the pointer nipped keenly\nand finally Anthony\'s bravado failed him; he winced and the tears came\nto his eyes.\n\nAnne, conscience-stricken, dropped the pointer and told Anthony to go\nto his seat. She sat down at her desk feeling ashamed, repentant, and\nbitterly mortified. Her quick anger was gone and she would have given\nmuch to have been able to seek relief in tears. So all her boasts had\ncome to this . . . she had actually whipped one of her pupils. How Jane\nwould triumph! And how Mr. Harrison would chuckle! But worse than\nthis, bitterest thought of all, she had lost her last chance of winning\nAnthony Pye. Never would he like her now.\n\nAnne, by what somebody has called ""a Herculaneum effort,"" kept back her\ntears until she got home that night. Then she shut herself in the east\ngable room and wept all her shame and remorse and disappointment into\nher pillows . . . wept so long that Marilla grew alarmed, invaded the\nroom, and insisted on knowing what the trouble was.\n\n""The trouble is, I\'ve got things the matter with my conscience,"" sobbed\nAnne. ""Oh, this has been such a Jonah day, Marilla. I\'m so ashamed of\nmyself. I lost my temper and whipped Anthony Pye.""\n\n""I\'m glad to hear it,"" said Marilla with decision. ""It\'s what you should\nhave done long ago.""\n\n""Oh, no, no, Marilla. And I don\'t see how I can ever look those children\nin the face again. I feel that I have humiliated myself to the very\ndust. You don\'t know how cross and hateful and horrid I was. I can\'t\nforget the expression in Paul Irving\'s eyes . . . he looked so surprised\nand disappointed. Oh, Marilla, I HAVE tried so hard to be patient and to\nwin Anthony\'s liking . . . and now it has all gone for nothing.""\n\nMarilla passed her hard work-worn hand over the girl\'s glossy, tumbled\nhair with a wonderful tenderness. When Anne\'s sobs grew quieter she\nsaid, very gently for her,\n\n""You take things too much to heart, Anne. We all make mistakes . . . but\npeople forget them. And Jonah days come to everybody. As for Anthony\nPye, why need you care if he does dislike you? He is the only one.""\n\n""I can\'t help it. I want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when\nanybody doesn\'t. And Anthony never will now. Oh, I just made an idiot of\nmyself today, Marilla. I\'ll tell you the whole story.""\n\nMarilla listened to the whole story, and if she smiled at certain parts\nof it Anne never knew. When the tale was ended she said briskly,\n\n""Well, never mind. This day\'s done and there\'s a new one coming\ntomorrow, with no mistakes in it yet, as you used to say yourself. Just\ncome downstairs and have your supper. You\'ll see if a good cup of tea\nand those plum puffs I made today won\'t hearten you up.""\n\n""Plum puffs won\'t minister to a mind diseased,"" said Anne\ndisconsolately; but Marilla thought it a good sign that she had\nrecovered sufficiently to adapt a quotation.\n\nThe cheerful supper table, with the twins\' bright faces, and Marilla\'s\nmatchless plum puffs . . . of which Davy ate four . . .  did ""hearten her\nup"" considerably after all. She had a good sleep that night and\nawakened in the morning to find herself and the world transformed. It\nhad snowed softly and thickly all through the hours of darkness and the\nbeautiful whiteness, glittering in the frosty sunshine, looked like a\nmantle of charity cast over all the mistakes and humiliations of the\npast.\n\n     ""Every morn is a fresh beginning,\n     Every morn is the world made new,""\n\nsang Anne, as she dressed.\n\nOwing to the snow she had to go around by the road to school and she\nthought it was certainly an impish coincidence that Anthony Pye should\ncome ploughing along just as she left the Green Gables lane. She felt\nas guilty as if their positions were reversed; but to her unspeakable\nastonishment Anthony not only lifted his cap . . . which he had never done\nbefore . . . but said easily,\n\n""Kind of bad walking, ain\'t it? Can I take those books for you,\nteacher?""\n\nAnne surrendered her books and wondered if she could possibly be awake.\nAnthony walked on in silence to the school, but when Anne took her books\nshe smiled down at him . . . not the stereotyped ""kind"" smile she had so\npersistently assumed for his benefit but a sudden outflashing of good\ncomradeship. Anthony smiled . . . no, if the truth must be told, Anthony\nGRINNED back. A grin is not generally supposed to be a respectful thing;\nyet Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthony\'s liking she\nhad, somehow or other, won his respect.\n\nMrs. Rachel Lynde came up the next Saturday and confirmed this.\n\n""Well, Anne, I guess you\'ve won over Anthony Pye, that\'s what. He says\nhe believes you are some good after all, even if you are a girl. Says\nthat whipping you gave him was \'just as good as a man\'s.\'""\n\n""I never expected to win him by whipping him, though,"" said Anne,\na little mournfully, feeling that her ideals had played her false\nsomewhere. ""It doesn\'t seem right. I\'m sure my theory of kindness can\'t\nbe wrong.""\n\n""No, but the Pyes are an exception to every known rule, that\'s what,""\ndeclared Mrs. Rachel with conviction.\n\nMr. Harrison said, ""Thought you\'d come to it,"" when he heard it, and\nJane rubbed it in rather unmercifully.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nA Golden Picnic\n\n\nAnne, on her way to Orchard Slope, met Diana, bound for Green Gables,\njust where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the Haunted\nWood, and they sat down by the margin of the Dryad\'s Bubble, where tiny\nferns were unrolling like curly-headed green pixy folk wakening up from\na nap.\n\n""I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my\nbirthday on Saturday,"" said Anne.\n\n""Your birthday? But your birthday was in March!""\n\n""That wasn\'t my fault,"" laughed Anne. ""If my parents had consulted me\nit would never have happened then. I should have chosen to be born in\nspring, of course. It must be delightful to come into the world with the\nmayflowers and violets. You would always feel that you were their foster\nsister. But since I didn\'t, the next best thing is to celebrate my\nbirthday in the spring. Priscilla is coming over Saturday and Jane will\nbe home. We\'ll all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day\nmaking the acquaintance of the spring. We none of us really know her\nyet, but we\'ll meet her back there as we never can anywhere else. I\nwant to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow. I have a\nconviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have\nnever really been SEEN although they may have been LOOKED at. We\'ll\nmake friends with wind and sky and sun, and bring home the spring in our\nhearts.""\n\n""It SOUNDS awfully nice,"" said Diana, with some inward distrust of\nAnne\'s magic of words. ""But won\'t it be very damp in some places yet?""\n\n""Oh, we\'ll wear rubbers,"" was Anne\'s concession to practicalities.\n""And I want you to come over early Saturday morning and help me prepare\nlunch. I\'m going to have the daintiest things possible . . .  things that\nwill match the spring, you understand . . . little jelly tarts and lady\nfingers, and drop cookies frosted with pink and yellow icing, and\nbuttercup cake. And we must have sandwiches too, though they\'re NOT very\npoetical.""\n\nSaturday proved an ideal day for a picnic . . . a day of breeze and blue,\nwarm, sunny, with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow\nand orchard. Over every sunlit upland and field was a delicate,\nflower-starred green.\n\nMr. Harrison, harrowing at the back of his farm and feeling some of the\nspring witch-work even in his sober, middle-aged blood, saw four girls,\nbasket laden, tripping across the end of his field where it joined a\nfringing woodland of birch and fir. Their blithe voices and laughter\nechoed down to him.\n\n""It\'s so easy to be happy on a day like this, isn\'t it?"" Anne was\nsaying, with true Anneish philosophy. ""Let\'s try to make this a really\ngolden day, girls, a day to which we can always look back with delight.\nWe\'re to seek for beauty and refuse to see anything else. \'Begone, dull\ncare!\' Jane, you are thinking of something that went wrong in school\nyesterday.""\n\n""How do you know?"" gasped Jane, amazed.\n\n""Oh, I know the expression . . . I\'ve felt it often enough on my own face.\nBut put it out of your mind, there\'s a dear. It will keep till Monday\n. . . or if it doesn\'t so much the better. Oh, girls, girls, see that patch\nof violets! There\'s something for memory\'s picture gallery. When I\'m\neighty years old . . . if I ever am . . . I shall shut my eyes and see\nthose violets just as I see them now. That\'s the first good gift our day\nhas given us.""\n\n""If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet,"" said\nPriscilla.\n\nAnne glowed.\n\n""I\'m so glad you SPOKE that thought, Priscilla, instead of just\nthinking it and keeping it to yourself. This world would be a much more\ninteresting place . . . although it IS very interesting anyhow . . .  if\npeople spoke out their real thoughts.""\n\n""It would be too hot to hold some folks,"" quoted Jane sagely.\n\n""I suppose it might be, but that would be their own faults for thinking\nnasty things. Anyhow, we can tell all our thoughts today because we are\ngoing to have nothing but beautiful thoughts. Everybody can say just\nwhat comes into her head. THAT is conversation. Here\'s a little path I\nnever saw before. Let\'s explore it.""\n\nThe path was a winding one, so narrow that the girls walked in single\nfile and even then the fir boughs brushed their faces. Under the firs\nwere velvety cushions of moss, and further on, where the trees were\nsmaller and fewer, the ground was rich in a variety of green growing\nthings.\n\n""What a lot of elephant\'s ears,"" exclaimed Diana. ""I\'m going to pick a\nbig bunch, they\'re so pretty.""\n\n""How did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful\nname?"" asked Priscilla.\n\n""Because the person who first named them either had no imagination at\nall or else far too much,"" said Anne, ""Oh, girls, look at that!""\n\n""That"" was a shallow woodland pool in the center of a little open glade\nwhere the path ended. Later on in the season it would be dried up\nand its place filled with a rank growth of ferns; but now it was a\nglimmering placid sheet, round as a saucer and clear as crystal. A\nring of slender young birches encircled it and little ferns fringed its\nmargin.\n\n""HOW sweet!"" said Jane.\n\n""Let us dance around it like wood-nymphs,"" cried Anne, dropping her\nbasket and extending her hands.\n\nBut the dance was not a success for the ground was boggy and Jane\'s\nrubbers came off.\n\n""You can\'t be a wood-nymph if you have to wear rubbers,"" was her\ndecision.\n\n""Well, we must name this place before we leave it,"" said Anne, yielding\nto the indisputable logic of facts. ""Everybody suggest a name and we\'ll\ndraw lots. Diana?""\n\n""Birch Pool,"" suggested Diana promptly.\n\n""Crystal Lake,"" said Jane.\n\nAnne, standing behind them, implored Priscilla with her eyes not to\nperpetrate another such name and Priscilla rose to the occasion with\n""Glimmer-glass."" Anne\'s selection was ""The Fairies\' Mirror.""\n\nThe names were written on strips of birch bark with a pencil Schoolma\'am\nJane produced from her pocket, and placed in Anne\'s hat. Then Priscilla\nshut her eyes and drew one. ""Crystal Lake,"" read Jane triumphantly.\nCrystal Lake it was, and if Anne thought that chance had played the pool\na shabby trick she did not say so.\n\nPushing through the undergrowth beyond, the girls came out to the young\ngreen seclusion of Mr. Silas Sloane\'s back pasture. Across it they\nfound the entrance to a lane striking up through the woods and voted\nto explore it also. It rewarded their quest with a succession of pretty\nsurprises. First, skirting Mr. Sloane\'s pasture, came an archway of wild\ncherry trees all in bloom. The girls swung their hats on their arms\nand wreathed their hair with the creamy, fluffy blossoms. Then the lane\nturned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark\nthat they walked in a gloom as of twilight, with not a glimpse of sky or\nsunlight to be seen.\n\n""This is where the bad wood elves dwell,"" whispered Anne. ""They are\nimpish and malicious but they can\'t harm us, because they are not\nallowed to do evil in the spring. There was one peeping at us around\nthat old twisted fir; and didn\'t you see a group of them on that big\nfreckly toadstool we just passed? The good fairies always dwell in the\nsunshiny places.""\n\n""I wish there really were fairies,"" said Jane. ""Wouldn\'t it be nice to\nhave three wishes granted you . . . or even only one? What would you wish\nfor, girls, if you could have a wish granted? I\'d wish to be rich and\nbeautiful and clever.""\n\n""I\'d wish to be tall and slender,"" said Diana.\n\n""I would wish to be famous,"" said Priscilla. Anne thought of her hair\nand then dismissed the thought as unworthy.\n\n""I\'d wish it might be spring all the time and in everybody\'s heart and\nall our lives,"" she said.\n\n""But that,"" said Priscilla, ""would be just wishing this world were like\nheaven.""\n\n""Only like a part of heaven. In the other parts there would be summer\nand autumn . . . yes, and a bit of winter, too. I think I want glittering\nsnowy fields and white frosts in heaven sometimes. Don\'t you, Jane?""\n\n""I . . . I don\'t know,"" said Jane uncomfortably. Jane was a good girl,\na member of the church, who tried conscientiously to live up to her\nprofession and believed everything she had been taught. But she never\nthought about heaven any more than she could help, for all that.\n\n""Minnie May asked me the other day if we would wear our best dresses\nevery day in heaven,"" laughed Diana.\n\n""And didn\'t you tell her we would?"" asked Anne.\n\n""Mercy, no! I told her we wouldn\'t be thinking of dresses at all there.""\n\n""Oh, I think we will . . . a LITTLE,"" said Anne earnestly. ""There\'ll be\nplenty of time in all eternity for it without neglecting more important\nthings. I believe we\'ll all wear beautiful dresses . . . or I suppose\nRAIMENT would be a more suitable way of speaking. I shall want to wear\npink for a few centuries at first . . . it would take me that long to get\ntired of it, I feel sure. I do love pink so and I can never wear it in\nTHIS world.""\n\nPast the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where\na log bridge spanned a brook; and then came the glory of a sunlit\nbeechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine, and the leaves\nfresh and green, and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous sunshine. Then\nmore wild cherries, and a little valley of lissome firs, and then a hill\nso steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it; but when they\nreached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all\nawaited them.\n\nBeyond were the ""back fields"" of the farms that ran out to the upper\nCarmody road. Just before them, hemmed in by beeches and firs but open\nto the south, was a little corner and in it a garden  . . . or what had\nonce been a garden. A tumbledown stone dyke, overgrown with mosses and\ngrass, surrounded it. Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry\ntrees, white as a snowdrift. There were traces of old paths still and\na double line of rosebushes through the middle; but all the rest of the\nspace was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi, in their airiest, most\nlavish, wind-swayed bloom above the lush green grasses.\n\n""Oh, how perfectly lovely!"" three of the girls cried. Anne only gazed in\neloquent silence.\n\n""How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back\nhere?"" said Priscilla in amazement.\n\n""It must be Hester Gray\'s garden,"" said Diana. ""I\'ve heard mother speak\nof it but I never saw it before, and I wouldn\'t have supposed that it\ncould be in existence still. You\'ve heard the story, Anne?""\n\n""No, but the name seems familiar to me.""\n\n""Oh, you\'ve seen it in the graveyard. She is buried down there in the\npoplar corner. You know the little brown stone with the opening gates\ncarved on it and \'Sacred to the memory of Hester Gray, aged twenty-two.\'\nJordan Gray is buried right beside her but there\'s no stone to him. It\'s\na wonder Marilla never told you about it, Anne. To be sure, it happened\nthirty years ago and everybody has forgotten.""\n\n""Well, if there\'s a story we must have it,"" said Anne. ""Let\'s sit right\ndown here among the narcissi and Diana will tell it. Why, girls, there\nare hundreds of them . . . they\'ve spread over everything. It looks as if\nthe garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined. This is\na discovery worth making. To think that I\'ve lived within a mile of this\nplace for six years and have never seen it before! Now, Diana.""\n\n""Long ago,"" began Diana, ""this farm belonged to old Mr. David Gray. He\ndidn\'t live on it . . . he lived where Silas Sloane lives now. He had one\nson, Jordan, and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while\nhe was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray. She\nwas working in a store and she hated it. She\'d been brought up in the\ncountry and she always wanted to get back. When Jordan asked her to\nmarry him she said she would if he\'d take her away to some quiet spot\nwhere she\'d see nothing but fields and trees. So he brought her to\nAvonlea. Mrs. Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a\nYankee, and it\'s certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor\nhousekeeper; but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan\njust worshipped the ground she walked on. Well, Mr. Gray gave Jordan\nthis farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester\nlived in it for four years. She never went out much and hardly anybody\nwent to see her except mother and Mrs. Lynde. Jordan made her this\ngarden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it. She\nwasn\'t much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers. And then\nshe got sick. Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she\never came here. She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker\nall the time. Jordan wouldn\'t have anybody to wait on her. He did it all\nhimself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman. Every\nday he\'d wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and she\'d\nlie there on a bench quite happy. They say she used to make Jordan kneel\ndown by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die\nout in the garden when the time came. And her prayer was answered. One\nday Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses\nthat were out and heaped them over her; and she just smiled up at him\n. . . and closed her eyes . . . and that,"" concluded Diana softly, ""was\nthe end.""\n\n""Oh, what a dear story,"" sighed Anne, wiping away her tears.\n\n""What became of Jordan?"" asked Priscilla.\n\n""He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston. Mr. Jabez\nSloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road.\nJordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried\nbeside Hester.""\n\n""I can\'t understand how she could have wanted to live back here, away\nfrom everything,"" said Jane.\n\n""Oh, I can easily understand THAT,"" said Anne thoughtfully. ""I wouldn\'t\nwant it myself for a steady thing, because, although I love the fields\nand woods, I love people too. But I can understand it in Hester. She\nwas tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people\nalways coming and going and caring nothing for her. She just wanted to\nescape from it all to some still, green, friendly place where she could\nrest. And she got just what she wanted, which is something very few\npeople do, I believe. She had four beautiful years before she died. . .\nfour years of perfect happiness, so I think she was to be envied more\nthan pitied. And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses,\nwith the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you . . . oh, I think\nit was beautiful!""\n\n""She set out those cherry trees over there,"" said Diana. ""She told\nmother she\'d never live to eat their fruit, but she wanted to think that\nsomething she had planted would go on living and helping to make the\nworld beautiful after she was dead.""\n\n""I\'m so glad we came this way,"" said Anne, the shining-eyed. ""This is\nmy adopted birthday, you know, and this garden and its story is the\nbirthday gift it has given me. Did your mother ever tell you what Hester\nGray looked like, Diana?""\n\n""No . . . only just that she was pretty.""\n\n""I\'m rather glad of that, because I can imagine what she looked like,\nwithout being hampered by facts. I think she was very slight and small,\nwith softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a\nlittle wistful, pale face.""\n\nThe girls left their baskets in Hester\'s garden and spent the rest\nof the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it,\ndiscovering many pretty nooks and lanes. When they got hungry they had\nlunch in the prettiest spot of all . . . on the steep bank of a gurgling\nbrook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses. The\ngirls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Anne\'s dainties,\neven the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty,\nunspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had\nenjoyed. Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests, but for\nher own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch\nbark. The cup leaked, and the water tasted of earth, as brook water\nis apt to do in spring; but Anne thought it more appropriate to the\noccasion than lemonade.\n\n""Look do you see that poem?"" she said suddenly, pointing.\n\n""Where?"" Jane and Diana stared, as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on\nthe birch trees.\n\n""There . . . down in the brook . . . that old green, mossy log with the\nwater flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if they\'d\nbeen combed, and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it,\nfar down into the pool. Oh, it\'s the most beautiful poem I ever saw.""\n\n""I should rather call it a picture,"" said Jane. ""A poem is lines and\nverses.""\n\n""Oh dear me, no."" Anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry\ncoronal positively. ""The lines and verses are only the outward garments\nof the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are\nYOU, Jane. The real poem is the soul within them  . . . and that beautiful\nbit is the soul of an unwritten poem. It is not every day one sees a\nsoul . . . even of a poem.""\n\n""I wonder what a soul . . . a person\'s soul . . . would look like,"" said\nPriscilla dreamily.\n\n""Like that, I should think,"" answered Anne, pointing to a radiance of\nsifted sunlight streaming through a birch tree. ""Only with shape and\nfeatures of course. I like to fancy souls as being made of light. And\nsome are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers . . . and some\nhave a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea . . . and some are pale and\ntransparent like mist at dawn.""\n\n""I read somewhere once that souls were like flowers,"" said Priscilla.\n\n""Then your soul is a golden narcissus,"" said Anne, ""and Diana\'s is like\na red, red rose. Jane\'s is an apple blossom, pink and wholesome and\nsweet.""\n\n""And your own is a white violet, with purple streaks in its heart,""\nfinished Priscilla.\n\nJane whispered to Diana that she really could not understand what they\nwere talking about. Could she?\n\nThe girls went home by the light of a calm golden sunset, their baskets\nfilled with narcissus blossoms from Hester\'s garden, some of which Anne\ncarried to the cemetery next day and laid upon Hester\'s grave. Minstrel\nrobins were whistling in the firs and the frogs were singing in the\nmarshes. All the basins among the hills were brimmed with topaz and\nemerald light.\n\n""Well, we have had a lovely time after all,"" said Diana, as if she had\nhardly expected to have it when she set out.\n\n""It has been a truly golden day,"" said Priscilla.\n\n""I\'m really awfully fond of the woods myself,"" said Jane.\n\nAnne said nothing. She was looking afar into the western sky and\nthinking of little Hester Gray.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nA Danger Averted\n\n\nAnne, walking home from the post office one Friday evening, was joined\nby Mrs. Lynde, who was as usual cumbered with all the cares of church\nand state.\n\n""I\'ve just been down to Timothy Cotton\'s to see if I could get Alice\nLouise to help me for a few days,"" she said. ""I had her last week, for,\nthough she\'s too slow to stop quick, she\'s better than nobody. But\nshe\'s sick and can\'t come. Timothy\'s sitting there, too, coughing and\ncomplaining. He\'s been dying for ten years and he\'ll go on dying for\nten years more. That kind can\'t even die and have done with it . . . they\ncan\'t stick to anything, even to being sick, long enough to finish it.\nThey\'re a terrible shiftless family and what is to become of them I\ndon\'t know, but perhaps Providence does.""\n\nMrs. Lynde sighed as if she rather doubted the extent of Providential\nknowledge on the subject.\n\n""Marilla was in about her eyes again Tuesday, wasn\'t she? What did the\nspecialist think of them?"" she continued.\n\n""He was much pleased,"" said Anne brightly. ""He says there is a great\nimprovement in them and he thinks the danger of her losing her sight\ncompletely is past. But he says she\'ll never be able to read much or\ndo any fine hand-work again. How are your preparations for your bazaar\ncoming on?""\n\nThe Ladies\' Aid Society was preparing for a fair and supper, and Mrs.\nLynde was the head and front of the enterprise.\n\n""Pretty well . . . and that reminds me. Mrs. Allan thinks it would be nice\nto fix up a booth like an old-time kitchen and serve a supper of baked\nbeans, doughnuts, pie, and so on. We\'re collecting old-fashioned fixings\neverywhere. Mrs. Simon Fletcher is going to lend us her mother\'s braided\nrugs and Mrs. Levi Boulter some old chairs and Aunt Mary Shaw will lend\nus her cupboard with the glass doors. I suppose Marilla will let us have\nher brass candlesticks? And we want all the old dishes we can get. Mrs.\nAllan is specially set on having a real blue willow ware platter if we\ncan find one. But nobody seems to have one. Do you know where we could\nget one?""\n\n""Miss Josephine Barry has one. I\'ll write and ask her if she\'ll lend it\nfor the occasion,"" said Anne.\n\n""Well, I wish you would. I guess we\'ll have the supper in about a\nfortnight\'s time. Uncle Abe Andrews is prophesying rain and storms for\nabout that time; and that\'s a pretty sure sign we\'ll have fine weather.""\n\nThe said ""Uncle Abe,"" it may be mentioned, was at least like other\nprophets in that he had small honor in his own country. He was, in\nfact, considered in the light of a standing joke, for few of his weather\npredictions were ever fulfilled. Mr. Elisha Wright, who labored under\nthe impression that he was a local wit, used to say that nobody in\nAvonlea ever thought of looking in the Charlottetown dailies for weather\nprobabilities. No; they just asked Uncle Abe what it was going to be\ntomorrow and expected the opposite. Nothing daunted, Uncle Abe kept on\nprophesying.\n\n""We want to have the fair over before the election comes off,"" continued\nMrs. Lynde, ""for the candidates will be sure to come and spend lots of\nmoney. The Tories are bribing right and left, so they might as well be\ngiven a chance to spend their money honestly for once.""\n\nAnne was a red-hot Conservative, out of loyalty to Matthew\'s memory,\nbut she said nothing. She knew better than to get Mrs. Lynde started\non politics. She had a letter for Marilla, postmarked from a town in\nBritish Columbia.\n\n""It\'s probably from the children\'s uncle,"" she said excitedly, when she\ngot home. ""Oh, Marilla, I wonder what he says about them.""\n\n""The best plan might be to open it and see,"" said Marilla curtly. A\nclose observer might have thought that she was excited also, but she\nwould rather have died than show it.\n\nAnne tore open the letter and glanced over the somewhat untidy and\npoorly written contents.\n\n""He says he can\'t take the children this spring . . . he\'s been sick most\nof the winter and his wedding is put off. He wants to know if we can\nkeep them till the fall and he\'ll try and take them then. We will, of\ncourse, won\'t we Marilla?""\n\n""I don\'t see that there is anything else for us to do,"" said Marilla\nrather grimly, although she felt a secret relief. ""Anyhow they\'re not so\nmuch trouble as they were . . . or else we\'ve got used to them. Davy has\nimproved a great deal.""\n\n""His MANNERS are certainly much better,"" said Anne cautiously, as if she\nwere not prepared to say as much for his morals.\n\nAnne had come home from school the previous evening, to find Marilla\naway at an Aid meeting, Dora asleep on the kitchen sofa, and Davy in\nthe sitting room closet, blissfully absorbing the contents of a jar of\nMarilla\'s famous yellow plum preserves . . .  ""company jam,"" Davy called\nit . . . which he had been forbidden to touch. He looked very guilty when\nAnne pounced on him and whisked him out of the closet.\n\n""Davy Keith, don\'t you know that it is very wrong of you to be eating\nthat jam, when you were told never to meddle with anything in THAT\ncloset?""\n\n""Yes, I knew it was wrong,"" admitted Davy uncomfortably, ""but plum jam\nis awful nice, Anne. I just peeped in and it looked so good I thought\nI\'d take just a weeny taste. I stuck my finger in . . ."" Anne groaned\n. . . ""and licked it clean. And it was so much gooder than I\'d ever thought\nthat I got a spoon and just SAILED IN.""\n\nAnne gave him such a serious lecture on the sin of stealing plum jam\nthat Davy became conscience stricken and promised with repentant kisses\nnever to do it again.\n\n""Anyhow, there\'ll be plenty of jam in heaven, that\'s one comfort,"" he\nsaid complacently.\n\nAnne nipped a smile in the bud.\n\n""Perhaps there will . . . if we want it,"" she said, ""But what makes you\nthink so?""\n\n""Why, it\'s in the catechism,"" said Davy.\n\n""Oh, no, there is nothing like THAT in the catechism, Davy.""\n\n""But I tell you there is,"" persisted Davy. ""It was in that question\nMarilla taught me last Sunday. \'Why should we love God?\' It says,\n\'Because He makes preserves, and redeems us.\' Preserves is just a holy\nway of saying jam.""\n\n""I must get a drink of water,"" said Anne hastily. When she came back it\ncost her some time and trouble to explain to Davy that a certain comma\nin the said catechism question made a great deal of difference in the\nmeaning.\n\n""Well, I thought it was too good to be true,"" he said at last, with a\nsigh of disappointed conviction. ""And besides, I didn\'t see when He\'d\nfind time to make jam if it\'s one endless Sabbath day, as the hymn\nsays. I don\'t believe I want to go to heaven. Won\'t there ever be any\nSaturdays in heaven, Anne?""\n\n""Yes, Saturdays, and every other kind of beautiful days. And every day\nin heaven will be more beautiful than the one before it, Davy,"" assured\nAnne, who was rather glad that Marilla was not by to be shocked.\nMarilla, it is needless to say, was bringing the twins up in the\ngood old ways of theology and discouraged all fanciful speculations\nthereupon. Davy and Dora were taught a hymn, a catechism question, and\ntwo Bible verses every Sunday. Dora learned meekly and recited like a\nlittle machine, with perhaps as much understanding or interest as if she\nwere one. Davy, on the contrary, had a lively curiosity, and frequently\nasked questions which made Marilla tremble for his fate.\n\n""Chester Sloane says we\'ll do nothing all the time in heaven but walk\naround in white dresses and play on harps; and he says he hopes he won\'t\nhave to go till he\'s an old man, \'cause maybe he\'ll like it better then.\nAnd he thinks it will be horrid to wear dresses and I think so too. Why\ncan\'t men angels wear trousers, Anne? Chester Sloane is interested in\nthose things, \'cause they\'re going to make a minister of him. He\'s got\nto be a minister \'cause his grandmother left the money to send him to\ncollege and he can\'t have it unless he is a minister. She thought a\nminister was such a \'spectable thing to have in a family. Chester says\nhe doesn\'t mind much . . . though he\'d rather be a blacksmith . . . but\nhe\'s bound to have all the fun he can before he begins to be a minister,\n\'cause he doesn\'t expect to have much afterwards. I ain\'t going to be a\nminister. I\'m going to be a storekeeper, like Mr. Blair, and keep heaps\nof candy and bananas. But I\'d rather like going to your kind of a heaven\nif they\'d let me play a mouth organ instead of a harp. Do you s\'pose\nthey would?""\n\n""Yes, I think they would if you wanted it,"" was all Anne could trust\nherself to say.\n\nThe A.V.I.S. met at Mr. Harmon Andrews\' that evening and a full\nattendance had been requested, since important business was to be\ndiscussed. The A.V.I.S. was in a flourishing condition, and had already\naccomplished wonders. Early in the spring Mr. Major Spencer had redeemed\nhis promise and had stumped, graded, and seeded down all the road front\nof his farm. A dozen other men, some prompted by a determination not to\nlet a Spencer get ahead of them, others goaded into action by Improvers\nin their own households, had followed his example. The result was\nthat there were long strips of smooth velvet turf where once had been\nunsightly undergrowth or brush. The farm fronts that had not been done\nlooked so badly by contrast that their owners were secretly shamed into\nresolving to see what they could do another spring. The triangle of\nground at the cross roads had also been cleared and seeded down, and\nAnne\'s bed of geraniums, unharmed by any marauding cow, was already set\nout in the center.\n\nAltogether, the Improvers thought that they were getting on beautifully,\neven if Mr. Levi Boulter, tactfully approached by a carefully selected\ncommittee in regard to the old house on his upper farm, did bluntly tell\nthem that he wasn\'t going to have it meddled with.\n\nAt this especial meeting they intended to draw up a petition to the\nschool trustees, humbly praying that a fence be put around the school\ngrounds; and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few\nornamental trees by the church, if the funds of the society would\npermit of it . . . for, as Anne said, there was no use in starting\nanother subscription as long as the hall remained blue. The members were\nassembled in the Andrews\' parlor and Jane was already on her feet to\nmove the appointment of a committee which should find out and report\non the price of said trees, when Gertie Pye swept in, pompadoured and\nfrilled within an inch of her life. Gertie had a habit of being late\n. . . ""to make her entrance more effective,"" spiteful people said.\nGertie\'s entrance in this instance was certainly effective, for she\npaused dramatically on the middle of the floor, threw up her hands,\nrolled her eyes, and exclaimed, ""I\'ve just heard something perfectly\nawful. What DO you think? Mr. Judson Parker IS GOING TO RENT ALL THE\nROAD FENCE OF HIS FARM TO A PATENT MEDICINE COMPANY TO PAINT\nADVERTISEMENTS ON.""\n\nFor once in her life Gertie Pye made all the sensation she desired. If\nshe had thrown a bomb among the complacent Improvers she could hardly\nhave made more.\n\n""It CAN\'T be true,"" said Anne blankly.\n\n""That\'s just what _I_ said when I heard it first, don\'t you know,"" said\nGertie, who was enjoying herself hugely. ""_I_ said it couldn\'t be true\n. . . that Judson Parker wouldn\'t have the HEART to do it, don\'t you know.\nBut father met him this afternoon and asked him about it and he said it\nWAS true. Just fancy! His farm is side-on to the Newbridge road and how\nperfectly awful it will look to see advertisements of pills and plasters\nall along it, don\'t you know?""\n\nThe Improvers DID know, all too well. Even the least imaginative among\nthem could picture the grotesque effect of half a mile of board fence\nadorned with such advertisements. All thought of church and school\ngrounds vanished before this new danger. Parliamentary rules and\nregulations were forgotten, and Anne, in despair, gave up trying to keep\nminutes at all. Everybody talked at once and fearful was the hubbub.\n\n""Oh, let us keep calm,"" implored Anne, who was the most excited of them\nall, ""and try to think of some way of preventing him.""\n\n""I don\'t know how you\'re going to prevent him,"" exclaimed Jane bitterly.\n""Everybody knows what Judson Parker is. He\'d do ANYTHING for money. He\nhasn\'t a SPARK of public spirit or ANY sense of the beautiful.""\n\nThe prospect looked rather unpromising. Judson Parker and his sister\nwere the only Parkers in Avonlea, so that no leverage could be exerted\nby family connections. Martha Parker was a lady of all too certain\nage who disapproved of young people in general and the Improvers\nin particular. Judson was a jovial, smooth-spoken man, so uniformly\ngoodnatured and bland that it was surprising how few friends he had.\nPerhaps he had got the better in too many business transactions. . .\nwhich seldom makes for popularity. He was reputed to be very ""sharp""\nand it was the general opinion that he ""hadn\'t much principle.""\n\n""If Judson Parker has a chance to \'turn an honest penny,\' as he says\nhimself, he\'ll never lose it,"" declared Fred Wright.\n\n""Is there NOBODY who has any influence over him?"" asked Anne\ndespairingly.\n\n""He goes to see Louisa Spencer at White Sands,"" suggested Carrie Sloane.\n""Perhaps she could coax him not to rent his fences.""\n\n""Not she,"" said Gilbert emphatically. ""I know Louisa Spencer well. She\ndoesn\'t \'believe\' in Village Improvement Societies, but she DOES believe\nin dollars and cents. She\'d be more likely to urge Judson on than to\ndissuade him.""\n\n""The only thing to do is to appoint a committee to wait on him and\nprotest,"" said Julia Bell, ""and you must send girls, for he\'d hardly be\ncivil to boys  . . . but _I_ won\'t go, so nobody need nominate me.""\n\n""Better send Anne alone,"" said Oliver Sloane. ""She can talk Judson over\nif anybody can.""\n\nAnne protested. She was willing to go and do the talking; but she must\nhave others with her ""for moral support."" Diana and Jane were therefore\nappointed to support her morally and the Improvers broke up, buzzing\nlike angry bees with indignation. Anne was so worried that she didn\'t\nsleep until nearly morning, and then she dreamed that the trustees had\nput a fence around the school and painted ""Try Purple Pills"" all over\nit.\n\nThe committee waited on Judson Parker the next afternoon. Anne pleaded\neloquently against his nefarious design and Jane and Diana supported her\nmorally and valiantly. Judson was sleek, suave, flattering; paid them\nseveral compliments of the delicacy of sunflowers; felt real bad to\nrefuse such charming young ladies  . . . but business was business;\ncouldn\'t afford to let sentiment stand in the way these hard times.\n\n""But I\'ll tell what I WILL do,"" he said, with a twinkle in his light,\nfull eyes. ""I\'ll tell the agent he must use only handsome, tasty colors\n. . . red and yellow and so on. I\'ll tell him he mustn\'t paint the ads\nBLUE on any account.""\n\nThe vanquished committee retired, thinking things not lawful to be\nuttered.\n\n""We have done all we can do and must simply trust the rest to\nProvidence,"" said Jane, with an unconscious imitation of Mrs. Lynde\'s\ntone and manner.\n\n""I wonder if Mr. Allan could do anything,"" reflected Diana.\n\nAnne shook her head.\n\n""No, it\'s no use to worry Mr. Allan, especially now when the baby\'s so\nsick. Judson would slip away from him as smoothly as from us, although\nhe HAS taken to going to church quite regularly just now. That is simply\nbecause Louisa Spencer\'s father is an elder and very particular about\nsuch things.""\n\n""Judson Parker is the only man in Avonlea who would dream of renting\nhis fences,"" said Jane indignantly. ""Even Levi Boulter or Lorenzo White\nwould never stoop to that, tightfisted as they are. They would have too\nmuch respect for public opinion.""\n\nPublic opinion was certainly down on Judson Parker when the facts became\nknown, but that did not help matters much. Judson chuckled to himself\nand defied it, and the Improvers were trying to reconcile themselves to\nthe prospect of seeing the prettiest part of the Newbridge road defaced\nby advertisements, when Anne rose quietly at the president\'s call\nfor reports of committees on the occasion of the next meeting of the\nSociety, and announced that Mr. Judson Parker had instructed her to\ninform the Society that he was NOT going to rent his fences to the\nPatent Medicine Company.\n\nJane and Diana stared as if they found it hard to believe their ears.\nParliamentary etiquette, which was generally very strictly enforced in\nthe A.V.I.S., forbade them giving instant vent to their curiosity, but\nafter the Society adjourned Anne was besieged for explanations. Anne had\nno explanation to give. Judson Parker had overtaken her on the road the\npreceding evening and told her that he had decided to humor the A.V.I.S.\nin its peculiar prejudice against patent medicine advertisements. That\nwas all Anne would say, then or ever afterwards, and it was the simple\ntruth; but when Jane Andrews, on her way home, confided to Oliver Sloane\nher firm belief that there was more behind Judson Parker\'s mysterious\nchange of heart than Anne Shirley had revealed, she spoke the truth\nalso.\n\nAnne had been down to old Mrs. Irving\'s on the shore road the preceding\nevening and had come home by a short cut which led her first over the\nlow-lying shore fields, and then through the beech wood below Robert\nDickson\'s, by a little footpath that ran out to the main road just above\nthe Lake of Shining Waters . . . known to unimaginative people as Barry\'s\npond.\n\nTwo men were sitting in their buggies, reined off to the side of the\nroad, just at the entrance of the path. One was Judson Parker; the other\nwas Jerry Corcoran, a Newbridge man against whom, as Mrs. Lynde would\nhave told you in eloquent italics, nothing shady had ever been PROVED.\nHe was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage\nin matters political. He had a finger . . .  some people said ALL his\nfingers . . . in every political pie that was cooked; and as Canada was\non the eve of a general election Jerry Corcoran had been a busy man\nfor many weeks, canvassing the county in the interests of his party\'s\ncandidate. Just as Anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs\nshe heard Corcoran say, ""If you\'ll vote for Amesbury, Parker . . . well,\nI\'ve a note for that pair of harrows you\'ve got in the spring. I suppose\nyou wouldn\'t object to having it back, eh?""\n\n""We . . . ll, since you put it in that way,"" drawled Judson with a\ngrin, ""I reckon I might as well do it. A man must look out for his own\ninterests in these hard times.""\n\nBoth saw Anne at this moment and conversation abruptly ceased. Anne\nbowed frostily and walked on, with her chin slightly more tilted than\nusual. Soon Judson Parker overtook her.\n\n""Have a lift, Anne?"" he inquired genially.\n\n""Thank you, no,"" said Anne politely, but with a fine, needle-like\ndisdain in her voice that pierced even Judson Parker\'s none too\nsensitive consciousness. His face reddened and he twitched his reins\nangrily; but the next second prudential considerations checked him. He\nlooked uneasily at Anne, as she walked steadily on, glancing neither to\nthe right nor to the left. Had she heard Corcoran\'s unmistakable\noffer and his own too plain acceptance of it? Confound Corcoran! If\nhe couldn\'t put his meaning into less dangerous phrases he\'d get\ninto trouble some of these long-come-shorts. And confound redheaded\nschool-ma\'ams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had\nno business to be. If Anne had heard, Judson Parker, measuring her corn\nin his own half bushel, as the country saying went, and cheating himself\nthereby, as such people generally do, believed that she would tell\nit far and wide. Now, Judson Parker, as has been seen, was not overly\nregardful of public opinion; but to be known as having accepted a bribe\nwould be a nasty thing; and if it ever reached Isaac Spencer\'s ears\nfarewell forever to all hope of winning Louisa Jane with her comfortable\nprospects as the heiress of a well-to-do farmer. Judson Parker knew\nthat Mr. Spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was; he could not\nafford to take any risks.\n\n""Ahem . . . Anne, I\'ve been wanting to see you about that little matter we\nwere discussing the other day. I\'ve decided not to let my fences to\nthat company after all. A society with an aim like yours ought to be\nencouraged.""\n\nAnne thawed out the merest trifle.\n\n""Thank you,"" she said.\n\n""And . . . and . . . you needn\'t mention that little conversation of mine\nwith Jerry.""\n\n""I have no intention of mentioning it in any case,"" said Anne icily, for\nshe would have seen every fence in Avonlea painted with advertisements\nbefore she would have stooped to bargain with a man who would sell his\nvote.\n\n""Just so . . . just so,"" agreed Judson, imagining that they understood\neach other beautifully. ""I didn\'t suppose you would. Of course, I was\nonly stringing Jerry . . . he thinks he\'s so all-fired cute and smart.\nI\'ve no intention of voting for Amesbury. I\'m going to vote for Grant as\nI\'ve always done . . . you\'ll see that when the election comes off. I just\nled Jerry on to see if he would commit himself. And it\'s all right about\nthe fence  . . . you can tell the Improvers that.""\n\n""It takes all sorts of people to make a world, as I\'ve often heard, but\nI think there are some who could be spared,"" Anne told her reflection\nin the east gable mirror that night. ""I wouldn\'t have mentioned the\ndisgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT\nscore. I really don\'t know who or what is to be thanked for this. _I_\ndid nothing to bring it about, and it\'s hard to believe that Providence\never works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and\nJerry Corcoran have.""\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nThe Beginning of Vacation\n\n\nAnne locked the schoolhouse door on a still, yellow evening, when the\nwinds were purring in the spruces around the playground, and the shadows\nwere long and lazy by the edge of the woods. She dropped the key into\nher pocket with a sigh of satisfaction. The school year was ended, she\nhad been reengaged for the next, with many expressions of satisfaction.\n. . . only Mr. Harmon Andrews told her she ought to use the strap\noftener . . . and two delightful months of a well-earned vacation\nbeckoned her invitingly. Anne felt at peace with the world and herself\nas she walked down the hill with her basket of flowers in her hand.\nSince the earliest mayflowers Anne had never missed her weekly\npilgrimage to Matthew\'s grave. Everyone else in Avonlea, except Marilla,\nhad already forgotten quiet, shy, unimportant Matthew Cuthbert; but his\nmemory was still green in Anne\'s heart and always would be. She could\nnever forget the kind old man who had been the first to give her the\nlove and sympathy her starved childhood had craved.\n\nAt the foot of the hill a boy was sitting on the fence in the shadow of\nthe spruces . . . a boy with big, dreamy eyes and a beautiful, sensitive\nface. He swung down and joined Anne, smiling; but there were traces of\ntears on his cheeks.\n\n""I thought I\'d wait for you, teacher, because I knew you were going to\nthe graveyard,"" he said, slipping his hand into hers. ""I\'m going there,\ntoo . . . I\'m taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irving\'s\ngrave for grandma. And look, teacher, I\'m going to put this bunch of\nwhite roses beside Grandpa\'s grave in memory of my little mother. . .\nbecause I can\'t go to her grave to put it there. But don\'t you think\nshe\'ll know all about it, just the same?""\n\n""Yes, I am sure she will, Paul.""\n\n""You see, teacher, it\'s just three years today since my little mother\ndied. It\'s such a long, long time but it hurts just as much as ever\n. . . and I miss her just as much as ever. Sometimes it seems to me\nthat I just can\'t bear it, it hurts so.""\n\nPaul\'s voice quivered and his lip trembled. He looked down at his roses,\nhoping that his teacher would not notice the tears in his eyes.\n\n""And yet,"" said Anne, very softly, ""you wouldn\'t want it to stop hurting\n . . . you wouldn\'t want to forget your little mother even if you could.""\n\n""No, indeed, I wouldn\'t . . . that\'s just the way I feel. You\'re so good\nat understanding, teacher. Nobody else understands so well . . . not even\ngrandma, although she\'s so good to me. Father understood pretty well,\nbut still I couldn\'t talk much to him about mother, because it made him\nfeel so bad. When he put his hand over his face I always knew it was\ntime to stop. Poor father, he must be dreadfully lonesome without\nme; but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks\nhousekeepers are no good to bring up little boys, especially when he has\nto be away from home so much on business. Grandmothers are better, next\nto mothers. Someday, when I\'m brought up, I\'ll go back to father and\nwe\'re never going to be parted again.""\n\nPaul had talked so much to Anne about his mother and father that she\nfelt as if she had known them. She thought his mother must have been\nvery like what he was himself, in temperament and disposition; and she\nhad an idea that Stephen Irving was a rather reserved man with a deep\nand tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world.\n\n""Father\'s not very easy to get acquainted with,"" Paul had said once. ""I\nnever got really acquainted with him until after my little mother died.\nBut he\'s splendid when you do get to know him. I love him the best in\nall the world, and Grandma Irving next, and then you, teacher. I\'d love\nyou next to father if it wasn\'t my DUTY to love Grandma Irving best,\nbecause she\'s doing so much for me. YOU know, teacher. I wish she would\nleave the lamp in my room till I go to sleep, though. She takes it right\nout as soon as she tucks me up because she says I mustn\'t be a coward.\nI\'m NOT scared, but I\'d RATHER have the light. My little mother used\nalways to sit beside me and hold my hand till I went to sleep. I expect\nshe spoiled me. Mothers do sometimes, you know.""\n\nNo, Anne did not know this, although she might imagine it. She thought\nsadly of HER ""little mother,"" the mother who had thought her so\n""perfectly beautiful"" and who had died so long ago and was buried beside\nher boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away. Anne could not\nremember her mother and for this reason she almost envied Paul.\n\n""My birthday is next week,"" said Paul, as they walked up the long red\nhill, basking in the June sunshine, ""and father wrote me that he is\nsending me something that he thinks I\'ll like better than anything else\nhe could send. I believe it has come already, for Grandma is keeping the\nbookcase drawer locked and that is something new. And when I asked her\nwhy, she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustn\'t be too\ncurious. It\'s very exciting to have a birthday, isn\'t it? I\'ll be\neleven. You\'d never think it to look at me, would you? Grandma says\nI\'m very small for my age and that it\'s all because I don\'t eat enough\nporridge. I do my very best, but Grandma gives such generous platefuls\n. . . there\'s nothing mean about Grandma, I can tell you. Ever since you\nand I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School\nthat day, teacher . . .  when you said we ought to pray about all our\ndifficulties . . . I\'ve prayed every night that God would give me enough\ngrace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings. But\nI\'ve never been able to do it yet, and whether it\'s because I have too\nlittle grace or too much porridge I really can\'t decide. Grandma says\nfather was brought up on porridge, and it certainly did work well in\nhis case, for you ought to see the shoulders he has. But sometimes,""\nconcluded Paul with a sigh and a meditative air ""I really think porridge\nwill be the death of me.""\n\nAnne permitted herself a smile, since Paul was not looking at her.\nAll Avonlea knew that old Mrs. Irving was bringing her grandson up in\naccordance with the good, old-fashioned methods of diet and morals.\n\n""Let us hope not, dear,"" she said cheerfully. ""How are your rock people\ncoming on? Does the oldest Twin still continue to behave himself?""\n\n""He HAS to,"" said Paul emphatically. ""He knows I won\'t associate with\nhim if he doesn\'t. He is really full of wickedness, I think.""\n\n""And has Nora found out about the Golden Lady yet?""\n\n""No; but I think she suspects. I\'m almost sure she watched me the last\ntime I went to the cave. _I_ don\'t mind if she finds out . . .  it is only\nfor HER sake I don\'t want her to . . . so that her feelings won\'t be hurt.\nBut if she is DETERMINED to have her feelings hurt it can\'t be helped.""\n\n""If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could\nsee your rock people too?""\n\nPaul shook his head gravely.\n\n""No, I don\'t think you could see MY rock people. I\'m the only person who\ncan see them. But you could see rock people of your own. You\'re one of\nthe kind that can. We\'re both that kind. YOU know, teacher,"" he added,\nsqueezing her hand chummily. ""Isn\'t it splendid to be that kind,\nteacher?""\n\n""Splendid,"" Anne agreed, gray shining eyes looking down into blue\nshining ones. Anne and Paul both knew\n\n     ""How fair the realm\n     Imagination opens to the view,""\n\nand both knew the way to that happy land. There the rose of joy bloomed\nimmortal by dale and stream; clouds never darkened the sunny sky; sweet\nbells never jangled out of tune; and kindred spirits abounded. The\nknowledge of that land\'s geography . . .  ""east o\' the sun, west o\' the\nmoon"" . . . is priceless lore, not to be bought in any market place. It\nmust be the gift of the good fairies at birth and the years can never\ndeface it or take it away. It is better to possess it, living in a\ngarret, than to be the inhabitant of palaces without it.\n\nThe Avonlea graveyard was as yet the grass-grown solitude it had always\nbeen. To be sure, the Improvers had an eye on it, and Priscilla Grant\nhad read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the Society.\nAt some future time the Improvers meant to have the lichened, wayward\nold board fence replaced by a neat wire railing, the grass mown and the\nleaning monuments straightened up.\n\nAnne put on Matthew\'s grave the flowers she had brought for it, and then\nwent over to the little poplar shaded corner where Hester Gray slept.\nEver since the day of the spring picnic Anne had put flowers on Hester\'s\ngrave when she visited Matthew\'s. The evening before she had made a\npilgrimage back to the little deserted garden in the woods and brought\ntherefrom some of Hester\'s own white roses.\n\n""I thought you would like them better than any others, dear,"" she said\nsoftly.\n\nAnne was still sitting there when a shadow fell over the grass and she\nlooked up to see Mrs. Allan. They walked home together.\n\nMrs. Allan\'s face was not the face of the girlbride whom the minister\nhad brought to Avonlea five years before. It had lost some of its bloom\nand youthful curves, and there were fine, patient lines about eyes and\nmouth. A tiny grave in that very cemetery accounted for some of them;\nand some new ones had come during the recent illness, now happily over,\nof her little son. But Mrs. Allan\'s dimples were as sweet and sudden as\never, her eyes as clear and bright and true; and what her face lacked\nof girlish beauty was now more than atoned for in added tenderness and\nstrength.\n\n""I suppose you are looking forward to your vacation, Anne?"" she said, as\nthey left the graveyard.\n\nAnne nodded.\n\n""Yes. . . . I could roll the word as a sweet morsel under my tongue. I\nthink the summer is going to be lovely. For one thing, Mrs. Morgan is\ncoming to the Island in July and Priscilla is going to bring her up. I\nfeel one of my old \'thrills\' at the mere thought.""\n\n""I hope you\'ll have a good time, Anne. You\'ve worked very hard this past\nyear and you have succeeded.""\n\n""Oh, I don\'t know. I\'ve come so far short in so many things. I haven\'t\ndone what I meant to do when I began to teach last fall. I haven\'t lived\nup to my ideals.""\n\n""None of us ever do,"" said Mrs. Allan with a sigh. ""But then, Anne, you\nknow what Lowell says, \'Not failure but low aim is crime.\' We must have\nideals and try to live up to them, even if we never quite succeed. Life\nwould be a sorry business without them. With them it\'s grand and great.\nHold fast to your ideals, Anne.""\n\n""I shall try. But I have to let go most of my theories,"" said Anne,\nlaughing a little. ""I had the most beautiful set of theories you ever\nknew when I started out as a schoolma\'am, but every one of them has\nfailed me at some pinch or another.""\n\n""Even the theory on corporal punishment,"" teased Mrs. Allan.\n\nBut Anne flushed.\n\n""I shall never forgive myself for whipping Anthony.""\n\n""Nonsense, dear, he deserved it. And it agreed with him. You have had no\ntrouble with him since and he has come to think there\'s nobody like you.\nYour kindness won his love after the idea that a \'girl was no good\' was\nrooted out of his stubborn mind.""\n\n""He may have deserved it, but that is not the point. If I had calmly and\ndeliberately decided to whip him because I thought it a just punishment\nfor him I would not feel over it as I do. But the truth is, Mrs. Allan,\nthat I just flew into a temper and whipped him because of that. I wasn\'t\nthinking whether it was just or unjust . . . even if he hadn\'t deserved it\nI\'d have done it just the same. That is what humiliates me.""\n\n""Well, we all make mistakes, dear, so just put it behind you. We should\nregret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward\ninto the future with us. There goes Gilbert Blythe on his wheel . . . home\nfor his vacation too, I suppose. How are you and he getting on with your\nstudies?""\n\n""Pretty well. We plan to finish the Virgil tonight . . . there are only\ntwenty lines to do. Then we are not going to study any more until\nSeptember.""\n\n""Do you think you will ever get to college?""\n\n""Oh, I don\'t know."" Anne looked dreamily afar to the opal-tinted\nhorizon. ""Marilla\'s eyes will never be much better than they are now,\nalthough we are so thankful to think that they will not get worse. And\nthen there are the twins . . . somehow I don\'t believe their uncle will\never really send for them. Perhaps college may be around the bend in the\nroad, but I haven\'t got to the bend yet and I don\'t think much about it\nlest I might grow discontented.""\n\n""Well, I should like to see you go to college, Anne; but if you never\ndo, don\'t be discontented about it. We make our own lives wherever we\nare, after all . . . college can only help us to do it more easily. They\nare broad or narrow according to what we put into them, not what we get\nout. Life is rich and full here . . .  everywhere . . . if we can only\nlearn how to open our whole hearts to its richness and fulness.""\n\n""I think I understand what you mean,"" said Anne thoughtfully, ""and I\nknow I have so much to feel thankful for . . . oh, so much . . .  my work,\nand Paul Irving, and the dear twins, and all my friends. Do you know,\nMrs. Allan, I\'m so thankful for friendship. It beautifies life so much.""\n\n""True friendship is a very helpful thing indeed,"" said Mrs. Allan,\n""and we should have a very high ideal of it, and never sully it by any\nfailure in truth and sincerity. I fear the name of friendship is often\ndegraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in\nit.""\n\n""Yes . . . like Gertie Pye\'s and Julia Bell\'s. They are very intimate\nand go everywhere together; but Gertie is always saying nasty things of\nJulia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because\nshe is always so pleased when anybody criticizes Julia. I think it is\ndesecration to call that friendship. If we have friends we should look\nonly for the best in them and give them the best that is in us, don\'t\nyou think? Then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the\nworld.""\n\n""Friendship IS very beautiful,"" smiled Mrs. Allan, ""but some day . . .""\n\nThen she paused abruptly. In the delicate, white-browed face beside her,\nwith its candid eyes and mobile features, there was still far more of\nthe child than of the woman. Anne\'s heart so far harbored only dreams of\nfriendship and ambition, and Mrs. Allan did not wish to brush the bloom\nfrom her sweet unconsciousness. So she left her sentence for the future\nyears to finish.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nThe Substance of Things Hoped For\n\n\n""Anne,"" said Davy appealingly, scrambling up on the shiny,\nleather-covered sofa in the Green Gables kitchen, where Anne sat,\nreading a letter, ""Anne, I\'m AWFUL hungry. You\'ve no idea.""\n\n""I\'ll get you a piece of bread and butter in a minute,"" said Anne\nabsently. Her letter evidently contained some exciting news, for her\ncheeks were as pink as the roses on the big bush outside, and her eyes\nwere as starry as only Anne\'s eyes could be.\n\n""But I ain\'t bread and butter hungry,"" said Davy in a disgusted tone.\n""I\'m plum cake hungry.""\n\n""Oh,"" laughed Anne, laying down her letter and putting her arm about\nDavy to give him a squeeze, ""that\'s a kind of hunger that can be endured\nvery comfortably, Davy-boy. You know it\'s one of Marilla\'s rules that\nyou can\'t have anything but bread and butter between meals.""\n\n""Well, gimme a piece then . . . please.""\n\nDavy had been at last taught to say ""please,"" but he generally tacked\nit on as an afterthought. He looked with approval at the generous slice\nAnne presently brought to him. ""You always put such a nice lot of butter\non it, Anne. Marilla spreads it pretty thin. It slips down a lot easier\nwhen there\'s plenty of butter.""\n\nThe slice ""slipped down"" with tolerable ease, judging from its rapid\ndisappearance. Davy slid head first off the sofa, turned a double\nsomersault on the rug, and then sat up and announced decidedly,\n\n""Anne, I\'ve made up my mind about heaven. I don\'t want to go there.""\n\n""Why not?"" asked Anne gravely.\n\n""Cause heaven is in Simon Fletcher\'s garret, and I don\'t like Simon\nFletcher.""\n\n""Heaven in . . . Simon Fletcher\'s garret!"" gasped Anne, too amazed even\nto laugh. ""Davy Keith, whatever put such an extraordinary idea into your\nhead?""\n\n""Milty Boulter says that\'s where it is. It was last Sunday in Sunday\nSchool. The lesson was about Elijah and Elisha, and I up and asked Miss\nRogerson where heaven was. Miss Rogerson looked awful offended. She was\ncross anyhow, because when she\'d asked us what Elijah left Elisha when\nhe went to heaven Milty Boulter said, \'His old clo\'es,\' and us fellows\nall laughed before we thought. I wish you could think first and do\nthings afterwards, \'cause then you wouldn\'t do them. But Milty didn\'t\nmean to be disrespeckful. He just couldn\'t think of the name of the\nthing. Miss Rogerson said heaven was where God was and I wasn\'t to ask\nquestions like that. Milty nudged me and said in a whisper, \'Heaven\'s\nin Uncle Simon\'s garret and I\'ll esplain about it on the road home.\' So\nwhen we was coming home he esplained. Milty\'s a great hand at esplaining\nthings. Even if he don\'t know anything about a thing he\'ll make up a lot\nof stuff and so you get it esplained all the same. His mother is Mrs.\nSimon\'s sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin, Jane\nEllen, died. The minister said she\'d gone to heaven, though Milty says\nshe was lying right before them in the coffin. But he s\'posed they\ncarried the coffin to the garret afterwards. Well, when Milty and his\nmother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked\nher where heaven was that Jane Ellen had gone to, and she pointed right\nto the ceiling and said, \'Up there.\' Milty knew there wasn\'t anything\nbut the garret over the ceiling, so that\'s how HE found out. And he\'s\nbeen awful scared to go to his Uncle Simon\'s ever since.""\n\nAnne took Davy on her knee and did her best to straighten out this\ntheological tangle also. She was much better fitted for the task than\nMarilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive\nunderstanding of the curious ideas that seven-year-olds sometimes get\nabout matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up\npeople. She had just succeeded in convincing Davy that heaven was NOT in\nSimon Fletcher\'s garret when Marilla came in from the garden, where she\nand Dora had been picking peas. Dora was an industrious little soul and\nnever happier than when ""helping"" in various small tasks suited to her\nchubby fingers. She fed chickens, picked up chips, wiped dishes, and ran\nerrands galore. She was neat, faithful and observant; she never had\nto be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little\nduties. Davy, on the other hand, was rather heedless and forgetful; but\nhe had the born knack of winning love, and even yet Anne and Marilla\nliked him the better.\n\nWhile Dora proudly shelled the peas and Davy made boats of the pods,\nwith masts of matches and sails of paper, Anne told Marilla about the\nwonderful contents of her letter.\n\n""Oh, Marilla, what do you think? I\'ve had a letter from Priscilla and\nshe says that Mrs. Morgan is on the Island, and that if it is fine\nThursday they are going to drive up to Avonlea and will reach here about\ntwelve. They will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at\nWhite Sands in the evening, because some of Mrs. Morgan\'s American\nfriends are staying there. Oh, Marilla, isn\'t it wonderful? I can hardly\nbelieve I\'m not dreaming.""\n\n""I daresay Mrs. Morgan is a lot like other people,"" said Marilla drily,\nalthough she did feel a trifle excited herself. Mrs. Morgan was a famous\nwoman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence. ""They\'ll be\nhere to dinner, then?""\n\n""Yes; and oh, Marilla, may I cook every bit of the dinner myself? I want\nto feel that I can do something for the author of \'The Rosebud Garden,\'\nif it is only to cook a dinner for her. You won\'t mind, will you?""\n\n""Goodness, I\'m not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in July that it\nwould vex me very much to have someone else do it. You\'re quite welcome\nto the job.""\n\n""Oh, thank you,"" said Anne, as if Marilla had just conferred a\ntremendous favor, ""I\'ll make out the menu this very night.""\n\n""You\'d better not try to put on too much style,"" warned Marilla, a\nlittle alarmed by the high-flown sound of \'menu.\' ""You\'ll likely come to\ngrief if you do.""\n\n""Oh, I\'m not going to put on any \'style,\' if you mean trying to do or\nhave things we don\'t usually have on festal occasions,"" assured Anne.\n""That would be affectation, and, although I know I haven\'t as much sense\nand steadiness as a girl of seventeen and a schoolteacher ought to have,\nI\'m not so silly as THAT. But I want to have everything as nice and\ndainty as possible. Davy-boy, don\'t leave those peapods on the back\nstairs . . . someone might slip on them. I\'ll have a light soup to begin\nwith . . . you know I can make lovely cream-of-onion soup . . . and then\na couple of roast fowls. I\'ll have the two white roosters. I have real\naffection for those roosters and they\'ve been pets ever since the gray\nhen hatched out just the two of them . . . little balls of yellow down.\nBut I know they would have to be sacrificed sometime, and surely there\ncouldn\'t be a worthier occasion than this. But oh, Marilla, _I_ cannot\nkill them . . . not even for Mrs. Morgan\'s sake. I\'ll have to ask John\nHenry Carter to come over and do it for me.""\n\n""I\'ll do it,"" volunteered Davy, ""if Marilla\'ll hold them by the legs,\n\'cause I guess it\'d take both my hands to manage the axe. It\'s awful\njolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off.""\n\n""Then I\'ll have peas and beans and creamed potatoes and a lettuce salad,\nfor vegetables,"" resumed Anne, ""and for dessert, lemon pie with whipped\ncream, and coffee and cheese and lady fingers. I\'ll make the pies and\nlady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress. And I must tell\nDiana tonight, for she\'ll want to do up hers. Mrs. Morgan\'s heroines\nare nearly always dressed in white muslin, and Diana and I have always\nresolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her. It will\nbe such a delicate compliment, don\'t you think? Davy, dear, you mustn\'t\npoke peapods into the cracks of the floor. I must ask Mr. and Mrs. Allan\nand Miss Stacy to dinner, too, for they\'re all very anxious to meet Mrs.\nMorgan. It\'s so fortunate she\'s coming while Miss Stacy is here. Davy\ndear, don\'t sail the peapods in the water bucket . . . go out to the\ntrough. Oh, I do hope it will be fine Thursday, and I think it will, for\nUncle Abe said last night when he called at Mr. Harrison\'s, that it was\ngoing to rain most of this week.""\n\n""That\'s a good sign,"" agreed Marilla.\n\nAnne ran across to Orchard Slope that evening to tell the news to Diana,\nwho was also very much excited over it, and they discussed the matter in\nthe hammock swung under the big willow in the Barry garden.\n\n""Oh, Anne, mayn\'t I help you cook the dinner?"" implored Diana. ""You know\nI can make splendid lettuce salad.""\n\n""Indeed you, may"" said Anne unselfishly. ""And I shall want you to help\nme decorate too. I mean to have the parlor simply a BOWER of blossoms\n. . . and the dining table is to be adorned with wild roses. Oh, I do\nhope everything will go smoothly. Mrs. Morgan\'s heroines NEVER get\ninto scrapes or are taken at a disadvantage, and they are always so\nselfpossessed and such good housekeepers. They seem to be BORN good\nhousekeepers. You remember that Gertrude in \'Edgewood Days\' kept house\nfor her father when she was only eight years old. When I was eight\nyears old I hardly knew how to do a thing except bring up children. Mrs.\nMorgan must be an authority on girls when she has written so much about\nthem, and I do want her to have a good opinion of us. I\'ve imagined\nit all out a dozen different ways . . . what she\'ll look like, and what\nshe\'ll say, and what I\'ll say. And I\'m so anxious about my nose. There\nare seven freckles on it, as you can see. They came at the A.V.I S.\npicnic, when I went around in the sun without my hat. I suppose it\'s\nungrateful of me to worry over them, when I should be thankful they\'re\nnot spread all over my face as they once were; but I do wish they hadn\'t\ncome . . . all Mrs. Morgan\'s heroines have such perfect complexions. I\ncan\'t recall a freckled one among them.""\n\n""Yours are not very noticeable,"" comforted Diana. ""Try a little lemon\njuice on them tonight.""\n\nThe next day Anne made her pies and lady fingers, did up her muslin\ndress, and swept and dusted every room in the house . . . a quite\nunnecessary proceeding, for Green Gables was, as usual, in the apple pie\norder dear to Marilla\'s heart. But Anne felt that a fleck of dust would\nbe a desecration in a house that was to be honored by a visit from\nCharlotte E. Morgan. She even cleaned out the ""catch-all"" closet under\nthe stairs, although there was not the remotest possibility of Mrs.\nMorgan\'s seeing its interior.\n\n""But I want to FEEL that it is in perfect order, even if she isn\'t to\nsee it,"" Anne told Marilla. ""You know, in her book \'Golden Keys,\' she\nmakes her two heroines Alice and Louisa take for their motto that verse\nof Longfellow\'s,\n\n     \'In the elder days of art\n     Builders wrought with greatest care\n     Each minute and unseen part,\n     For the gods see everywhere,\'\n\nand so they always kept their cellar stairs scrubbed and never forgot\nto sweep under the beds. I should have a guilty conscience if I thought\nthis closet was in disorder when Mrs. Morgan was in the house. Ever\nsince we read \'Golden Keys,\' last April, Diana and I have taken that\nverse for our motto too.""\n\nThat night John Henry Carter and Davy between them contrived to execute\nthe two white roosters, and Anne dressed them, the usually distasteful\ntask glorified in her eyes by the destination of the plump birds.\n\n""I don\'t like picking fowls,"" she told Marilla, ""but isn\'t it fortunate\nwe don\'t have to put our souls into what our hands may be doing? I\'ve\nbeen picking chickens with my hands but in imagination I\'ve been roaming\nthe Milky Way.""\n\n""I thought you\'d scattered more feathers over the floor than usual,""\nremarked Marilla.\n\nThen Anne put Davy to bed and made him promise that he would behave\nperfectly the next day.\n\n""If I\'m as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just\nas bad as I like all the next day?"" asked Davy.\n\n""I couldn\'t do that,"" said Anne discreetly, ""but I\'ll take you and Dora\nfor a row in the flat right to the bottom of the pond, and we\'ll go\nashore on the sandhills and have a picnic.""\n\n""It\'s a bargain,"" said Davy. ""I\'ll be good, you bet. I meant to go over\nto Mr. Harrison\'s and fire peas from my new popgun at Ginger but another\nday\'ll do as well. I espect it will be just like Sunday, but a picnic at\nthe shore\'ll make up for THAT.""\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nA Chapter of Accidents\n\n\nAnne woke three times in the night and made pilgrimages to her window to\nmake sure that Uncle Abe\'s prediction was not coming true. Finally the\nmorning dawned pearly and lustrous in a sky full of silver sheen and\nradiance, and the wonderful day had arrived.\n\nDiana appeared soon after breakfast, with a basket of flowers over one\narm and HER muslin dress over the other . . . for it would not do to don\nit until all the dinner preparations were completed. Meanwhile she wore\nher afternoon pink print and a lawn apron fearfully and wonderfully\nruffled and frilled; and very neat and pretty and rosy she was.\n\n""You look simply sweet,"" said Anne admiringly.\n\nDiana sighed.\n\n""But I\'ve had to let out every one of my dresses AGAIN. I weigh four\npounds more than I did in July. Anne, WHERE will this end? Mrs. Morgan\'s\nheroines are all tall and slender.""\n\n""Well, let\'s forget our troubles and think of our mercies,"" said Anne\ngaily. ""Mrs. Allan says that whenever we think of anything that is a\ntrial to us we should also think of something nice that we can set\nover against it. If you are slightly too plump you\'ve got the dearest\ndimples; and if I have a freckled nose the SHAPE of it is all right. Do\nyou think the lemon juice did any good?""\n\n""Yes, I really think it did,"" said Diana critically; and, much elated,\nAnne led the way to the garden, which was full of airy shadows and\nwavering golden lights.\n\n""We\'ll decorate the parlor first. We have plenty of time, for Priscilla\nsaid they\'d be here about twelve or half past at the latest, so we\'ll\nhave dinner at one.""\n\nThere may have been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in\nCanada or the United States at that moment, but I doubt it. Every snip\nof the scissors, as rose and peony and bluebell fell, seemed to chirp,\n""Mrs. Morgan is coming today."" Anne wondered how Mr. Harrison COULD go\non placidly mowing hay in the field across the lane, just as if nothing\nwere going to happen.\n\nThe parlor at Green Gables was a rather severe and gloomy apartment,\nwith rigid horsehair furniture, stiff lace curtains, and white\nantimacassars that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle, except\nat such times as they clung to unfortunate people\'s buttons. Even Anne\nhad never been able to infuse much grace into it, for Marilla would not\npermit any alterations. But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish\nif you give them a fair chance; when Anne and Diana finished with the\nroom you would not have recognized it.\n\nA great blue bowlful of snowballs overflowed on the polished table. The\nshining black mantelpiece was heaped with roses and ferns. Every shelf\nof the what-not held a sheaf of bluebells; the dark corners on either\nside of the grate were lighted up with jars full of glowing crimson\npeonies, and the grate itself was aflame with yellow poppies. All\nthis splendor and color, mingled with the sunshine falling through the\nhoneysuckle vines at the windows in a leafy riot of dancing shadows over\nwalls and floor, made of the usually dismal little room the veritable\n""bower"" of Anne\'s imagination, and even extorted a tribute of admiration\nfrom Marilla, who came in to criticize and remained to praise.\n\n""Now, we must set the table,"" said Anne, in the tone of a priestess\nabout to perform some sacred rite in honor of a divinity. ""We\'ll have a\nbig vaseful of wild roses in the center and one single rose in front\nof everybody\'s plate--and a special bouquet of rosebuds only by Mrs.\nMorgan\'s--an allusion to \'The Rosebud Garden\' you know.""\n\nThe table was set in the sitting room, with Marilla\'s finest linen and\nthe best china, glass, and silver. You may be perfectly certain that\nevery article placed on it was polished or scoured to the highest\npossible perfection of gloss and glitter.\n\nThen the girls tripped out to the kitchen, which was filled with\nappetizing odors emanating from the oven, where the chickens were\nalready sizzling splendidly. Anne prepared the potatoes and Diana got\nthe peas and beans ready. Then, while Diana shut herself into the pantry\nto compound the lettuce salad, Anne, whose cheeks were already beginning\nto glow crimson, as much with excitement as from the heat of the fire,\nprepared the bread sauce for the chickens, minced her onions for the\nsoup, and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies.\n\nAnd what about Davy all this time? Was he redeeming his promise to\nbe good? He was, indeed. To be sure, he insisted on remaining in the\nkitchen, for his curiosity wanted to see all that went on. But as he sat\nquietly in a corner, busily engaged in untying the knots in a piece of\nherring net he had brought home from his last trip to the shore, nobody\nobjected to this.\n\nAt half past eleven the lettuce salad was made, the golden circles of\nthe pies were heaped with whipped cream, and everything was sizzling and\nbubbling that ought to sizzle and bubble.\n\n""We\'d better go and dress now,"" said Anne, ""for they may be here by\ntwelve. We must have dinner at sharp one, for the soup must be served as\nsoon as it\'s done.""\n\nSerious indeed were the toilet rites presently performed in the east\ngable. Anne peered anxiously at her nose and rejoiced to see that its\nfreckles were not at all prominent, thanks either to the lemon juice\nor to the unusual flush on her cheeks. When they were ready they looked\nquite as sweet and trim and girlish as ever did any of ""Mrs. Morgan\'s\nheroines.""\n\n""I do hope I\'ll be able to say something once in a while, and not sit\nlike a mute,"" said Diana anxiously. ""All Mrs. Morgan\'s heroines converse\nso beautifully. But I\'m afraid I\'ll be tongue-tied and stupid. And I\'ll\nbe sure to say \'I seen.\' I haven\'t often said it since Miss Stacy taught\nhere; but in moments of excitement it\'s sure to pop out. Anne, if I\nwere to say \'I seen\' before Mrs. Morgan I\'d die of mortification. And it\nwould be almost as bad to have nothing to say.""\n\n""I\'m nervous about a good many things,"" said Anne, ""but I don\'t think\nthere is much fear that I won\'t be able to talk.""\n\nAnd, to do her justice, there wasn\'t.\n\nAnne shrouded her muslin glories in a big apron and went down to concoct\nher soup. Marilla had dressed herself and the twins, and looked more\nexcited than she had ever been known to look before. At half past twelve\nthe Allans and Miss Stacy came. Everything was going well but Anne was\nbeginning to feel nervous. It was surely time for Priscilla and Mrs.\nMorgan to arrive. She made frequent trips to the gate and looked as\nanxiously down the lane as ever her namesake in the Bluebeard story\npeered from the tower casement.\n\n""Suppose they don\'t come at all?"" she said piteously.\n\n""Don\'t suppose it. It would be too mean,"" said Diana, who, however, was\nbeginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject.\n\n""Anne,"" said Marilla, coming out from the parlor, ""Miss Stacy wants to\nsee Miss Barry\'s willowware platter.""\n\nAnne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter. She had,\nin accordance with her promise to Mrs. Lynde, written to Miss Barry of\nCharlottetown, asking for the loan of it. Miss Barry was an old friend\nof Anne\'s, and she promptly sent the platter out, with a letter exhorting\nAnne to be very careful of it, for she had paid twenty dollars for it.\nThe platter had served its purpose at the Aid bazaar and had then been\nreturned to the Green Gables closet, for Anne would not trust anybody\nbut herself to take it back to town.\n\nShe carried the platter carefully to the front door where her guests\nwere enjoying the cool breeze that blew up from the brook. It was\nexamined and admired; then, just as Anne had taken it back into her own\nhands, a terrific crash and clatter sounded from the kitchen pantry.\nMarilla, Diana, and Anne fled out, the latter pausing only long enough\nto set the precious platter hastily down on the second step of the\nstairs.\n\nWhen they reached the pantry a truly harrowing spectacle met their eyes\n. . . a guilty looking small boy scrambling down from the table, with his\nclean print blouse liberally plastered with yellow filling, and on the\ntable the shattered remnants of what had been two brave, becreamed lemon\npies.\n\nDavy had finished ravelling out his herring net and had wound the twine\ninto a ball. Then he had gone into the pantry to put it up on the shelf\nabove the table, where he already kept a score or so of similar balls,\nwhich, so far as could be discovered, served no useful purpose save to\nyield the joy of possession. Davy had to climb on the table and reach\nover to the shelf at a dangerous angle . . . something he had been\nforbidden by Marilla to do, as he had come to grief once before in the\nexperiment. The result in this instance was disastrous. Davy slipped\nand came sprawling squarely down on the lemon pies. His clean blouse was\nruined for that time and the pies for all time. It is, however, an ill\nwind that blows nobody good, and the pig was eventually the gainer by\nDavy\'s mischance.\n\n""Davy Keith,"" said Marilla, shaking him by the shoulder, ""didn\'t I\nforbid you to climb up on that table again? Didn\'t I?""\n\n""I forgot,"" whimpered Davy. ""You\'ve told me not to do such an awful lot\nof things that I can\'t remember them all.""\n\n""Well, you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner. Perhaps\nyou\'ll get them sorted out in your memory by that time. No, Anne, never\nyou mind interceding for him. I\'m not punishing him because he\nspoiled your pies . . . that was an accident. I\'m punishing him for his\ndisobedience. Go, Davy, I say.""\n\n""Ain\'t I to have any dinner?"" wailed Davy.\n\n""You can come down after dinner is over and have yours in the kitchen.""\n\n""Oh, all right,"" said Davy, somewhat comforted. ""I know Anne\'ll save\nsome nice bones for me, won\'t you, Anne? \'Cause you know I didn\'t mean\nto fall on the pies. Say, Anne, since they ARE spoiled can\'t I take some\nof the pieces upstairs with me?""\n\n""No, no lemon pie for you, Master Davy,"" said Marilla, pushing him\ntoward the hall.\n\n""What shall we do for dessert?"" asked Anne, looking regretfully at the\nwreck and ruin.\n\n""Get out a crock of strawberry preserves,"" said Marilla consolingly.\n""There\'s plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl for it.""\n\nOne o\'clock came . . . but no Priscilla or Mrs. Morgan. Anne was in an\nagony. Everything was done to a turn and the soup was just what soup\nshould be, but couldn\'t be depended on to remain so for any length of\ntime.\n\n""I don\'t believe they\'re coming after all,"" said Marilla crossly.\n\nAnne and Diana sought comfort in each other\'s eyes.\n\nAt half past one Marilla again emerged from the parlor.\n\n""Girls, we MUST have dinner. Everybody is hungry and it\'s no use waiting\nany longer. Priscilla and Mrs. Morgan are not coming, that\'s plain, and\nnothing is being improved by waiting.""\n\nAnne and Diana set about lifting the dinner, with all the zest gone out\nof the performance.\n\n""I don\'t believe I\'ll be able to eat a mouthful,"" said Diana dolefully.\n\n""Nor I. But I hope everything will be nice for Miss Stacy\'s and Mr. and\nMrs. Allan\'s sakes,"" said Anne listlessly.\n\nWhen Diana dished the peas she tasted them and a very peculiar\nexpression crossed her face.\n\n""Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?""\n\n""Yes,"" said Anne, mashing the potatoes with the air of one expected to\ndo her duty. ""I put a spoonful of sugar in. We always do. Don\'t you like\nit?""\n\n""But _I_ put a spoonful in too, when I set them on the stove,"" said\nDiana.\n\nAnne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also. Then she made a\ngrimace.\n\n""How awful! I never dreamed you had put sugar in, because I knew your\nmother never does. I happened to think of it, for a wonder . . .  I\'m\nalways forgetting it . . . so I popped a spoonful in.""\n\n""It\'s a case of too many cooks, I guess,"" said Marilla, who had listened\nto this dialogue with a rather guilty expression. ""I didn\'t think you\'d\nremember about the sugar, Anne, for I\'m perfectly certain you never did\nbefore . . . so _I_ put in a spoonful.""\n\nThe guests in the parlor heard peal after peal of laughter from the\nkitchen, but they never knew what the fun was about. There were no green\npeas on the dinner table that day, however.\n\n""Well,"" said Anne, sobering down again with a sigh of recollection, ""we\nhave the salad anyhow and I don\'t think anything has happened to the\nbeans. Let\'s carry the things in and get it over.""\n\nIt cannot be said that that dinner was a notable success socially.\nThe Allans and Miss Stacy exerted themselves to save the situation and\nMarilla\'s customary placidity was not noticeably ruffled. But Anne\nand Diana, between their disappointment and the reaction from their\nexcitement of the forenoon, could neither talk nor eat. Anne tried\nheroically to bear her part in the conversation for the sake of her\nguests; but all the sparkle had been quenched in her for the time being,\nand, in spite of her love for the Allans and Miss Stacy, she couldn\'t\nhelp thinking how nice it would be when everybody had gone home and she\ncould bury her weariness and disappointment in the pillows of the east\ngable.\n\nThere is an old proverb that really seems at times to be inspired . . .\n""it never rains but it pours."" The measure of that day\'s tribulations\nwas not yet full. Just as Mr. Allan had finished returning thanks there\narose a strange, ominous sound on the stairs, as of some hard, heavy\nobject bounding from step to step, finishing up with a grand smash\nat the bottom. Everybody ran out into the hall. Anne gave a shriek of\ndismay.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs lay a big pink conch shell amid the\nfragments of what had been Miss Barry\'s platter; and at the top of the\nstairs knelt a terrified Davy, gazing down with wide-open eyes at the\nhavoc.\n\n""Davy,"" said Marilla ominously, ""did you throw that conch down ON\nPURPOSE?""\n\n""No, I never did,"" whimpered Davy. ""I was just kneeling here, quiet as\nquiet, to watch you folks through the bannisters, and my foot struck\nthat old thing and pushed it off . . . and I\'m awful hungry . . . and I\ndo wish you\'d lick a fellow and have done with it, instead of always\nsending him upstairs to miss all the fun.""\n\n""Don\'t blame Davy,"" said Anne, gathering up the fragments with trembling\nfingers. ""It was my fault. I set that platter there and forgot all about\nit. I am properly punished for my carelessness; but oh, what will Miss\nBarry say?""\n\n""Well, you know she only bought it, so it isn\'t the same as if it was an\nheirloom,"" said Diana, trying to console.\n\nThe guests went away soon after, feeling that it was the most tactful\nthing to do, and Anne and Diana washed the dishes, talking less than\nthey had ever been known to do before. Then Diana went home with a\nheadache and Anne went with another to the east gable, where she stayed\nuntil Marilla came home from the post office at sunset, with a letter\nfrom Priscilla, written the day before. Mrs. Morgan had sprained her\nankle so severely that she could not leave her room.\n\n""And oh, Anne dear,"" wrote Priscilla, ""I\'m so sorry, but I\'m afraid we\nwon\'t get up to Green Gables at all now, for by the time Aunty\'s ankle\nis well she will have to go back to Toronto. She has to be there by a\ncertain date.""\n\n""Well,"" sighed Anne, laying the letter down on the red sandstone step\nof the back porch, where she was sitting, while the twilight rained down\nout of a dappled sky, ""I always thought it was too good to be true that\nMrs. Morgan should really come. But there . . . that speech sounds as\npessimistic as Miss Eliza Andrews and I\'m ashamed of making it. After\nall, it was NOT too good to be true . . . things just as good and far\nbetter are coming true for me all the time. And I suppose the events of\ntoday have a funny side too. Perhaps when Diana and I are old and gray\nwe shall be able to laugh over them. But I feel that I can\'t expect to\ndo it before then, for it has truly been a bitter disappointment.""\n\n""You\'ll probably have a good many more and worse disappointments than\nthat before you get through life,"" said Marilla, who honestly thought\nshe was making a comforting speech. ""It seems to me, Anne, that you are\nnever going to outgrow your fashion of setting your heart so on things\nand then crashing down into despair because you don\'t get them.""\n\n""I know I\'m too much inclined that, way"" agreed Anne ruefully. ""When I\nthink something nice is going to happen I seem to fly right up on the\nwings of anticipation; and then the first thing I realize I drop down to\nearth with a thud. But really, Marilla, the flying part IS glorious\nas long as it lasts . . . it\'s like soaring through a sunset. I think it\nalmost pays for the thud.""\n\n""Well, maybe it does,"" admitted Marilla. ""I\'d rather walk calmly along\nand do without both flying and thud. But everybody has her own way of\nliving . . . I used to think there was only one right way  . . . but since\nI\'ve had you and the twins to bring up I don\'t feel so sure of it. What\nare you going to do about Miss Barry\'s platter?""\n\n""Pay her back the twenty dollars she paid for it, I suppose. I\'m so\nthankful it wasn\'t a cherished heirloom because then no money could\nreplace it.""\n\n""Maybe you could find one like it somewhere and buy it for her.""\n\n""I\'m afraid not. Platters as old as that are very scarce. Mrs. Lynde\ncouldn\'t find one anywhere for the supper. I only wish I could, for of\ncourse Miss Barry would just as soon have one platter as another, if\nboth were equally old and genuine. Marilla, look at that big star over\nMr. Harrison\'s maple grove, with all that holy hush of silvery sky about\nit. It gives me a feeling that is like a prayer. After all, when one\ncan see stars and skies like that, little disappointments and accidents\ncan\'t matter so much, can they?""\n\n""Where\'s Davy?"" said Marilla, with an indifferent glance at the star.\n\n""In bed. I\'ve promised to take him and Dora to the shore for a picnic\ntomorrow. Of course, the original agreement was that he must be good.\nBut he TRIED to be good . . . and I hadn\'t the heart to disappoint him.""\n\n""You\'ll drown yourself or the twins, rowing about the pond in that\nflat,"" grumbled Marilla. ""I\'ve lived here for sixty years and I\'ve never\nbeen on the pond yet.""\n\n""Well, it\'s never too late to mend,"" said Anne roguishly. ""Suppose you\ncome with us tomorrow. We\'ll shut Green Gables up and spend the whole\nday at the shore, daffing the world aside.""\n\n""No, thank you,"" said Marilla, with indignant emphasis. ""I\'d be a nice\nsight, wouldn\'t I, rowing down the pond in a flat? I think I hear Rachel\npronouncing on it. There\'s Mr. Harrison driving away somewhere. Do you\nsuppose there is any truth in the gossip that Mr. Harrison is going to\nsee Isabella Andrews?""\n\n""No, I\'m sure there isn\'t. He just called there one evening on business\nwith Mr. Harmon Andrews and Mrs. Lynde saw him and said she knew he was\ncourting because he had a white collar on. I don\'t believe Mr. Harrison\nwill ever marry. He seems to have a prejudice against marriage.""\n\n""Well, you can never tell about those old bachelors. And if he had a\nwhite collar on I\'d agree with Rachel that it looks suspicious, for I\'m\nsure he never was seen with one before.""\n\n""I think he only put it on because he wanted to conclude a business deal\nwith Harmon Andrews,"" said Anne. ""I\'ve heard him say that\'s the only\ntime a man needs to be particular about his appearance, because if he\nlooks prosperous the party of the second part won\'t be so likely to try\nto cheat him. I really feel sorry for Mr. Harrison; I don\'t believe he\nfeels satisfied with his life. It must be very lonely to have no one to\ncare about except a parrot, don\'t you think? But I notice Mr. Harrison\ndoesn\'t like to be pitied. Nobody does, I imagine.""\n\n""There\'s Gilbert coming up the lane,"" said Marilla. ""If he wants you to\ngo for a row on the pond mind you put on your coat and rubbers. There\'s\na heavy dew tonight.""\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nAn Adventure on the Tory Road\n\n\n""Anne,"" said Davy, sitting up in bed and propping his chin on his hands,\n""Anne, where is sleep? People go to sleep every night, and of course I\nknow it\'s the place where I do the things I dream, but I want to know\nWHERE it is and how I get there and back without knowing anything about\nit . . . and in my nighty too. Where is it?""\n\nAnne was kneeling at the west gable window watching the sunset sky\nthat was like a great flower with petals of crocus and a heart of fiery\nyellow. She turned her head at Davy\'s question and answered dreamily,\n\n     ""\'Over the mountains of the moon,\n     Down the valley of the shadow.\'""\n\nPaul Irving would have known the meaning of this, or made a meaning out\nof it for himself, if he didn\'t; but practical Davy, who, as Anne\noften despairingly remarked, hadn\'t a particle of imagination, was only\npuzzled and disgusted.\n\n""Anne, I believe you\'re just talking nonsense.""\n\n""Of course, I was, dear boy. Don\'t you know that it is only very foolish\nfolk who talk sense all the time?""\n\n""Well, I think you might give a sensible answer when I ask a sensible\nquestion,"" said Davy in an injured tone.\n\n""Oh, you are too little to understand,"" said Anne. But she felt rather\nashamed of saying it; for had she not, in keen remembrance of many\nsimilar snubs administered in her own early years, solemnly vowed that\nshe would never tell any child it was too little to understand? Yet here\nshe was doing it . . . so wide sometimes is the gulf between theory and\npractice.\n\n""Well, I\'m doing my best to grow,"" said Davy, ""but it\'s a thing you\ncan\'t hurry much. If Marilla wasn\'t so stingy with her jam I believe I\'d\ngrow a lot faster.""\n\n""Marilla is not stingy, Davy,"" said Anne severely. ""It is very\nungrateful of you to say such a thing.""\n\n""There\'s another word that means the same thing and sounds a lot better,\nbut I don\'t just remember it,"" said Davy, frowning intently. ""I heard\nMarilla say she was it, herself, the other day.""\n\n""If you mean ECONOMICAL, it\'s a VERY different thing from being stingy.\nIt is an excellent trait in a person if she is economical. If Marilla\nhad been stingy she wouldn\'t have taken you and Dora when your mother\ndied. Would you have liked to live with Mrs. Wiggins?""\n\n""You just bet I wouldn\'t!"" Davy was emphatic on that point. ""Nor I don\'t\nwant to go out to Uncle Richard neither. I\'d far rather live here, even\nif Marilla is that long-tailed word when it comes to jam, \'cause YOU\'RE\nhere, Anne. Say, Anne, won\'t you tell me a story \'fore I go to sleep? I\ndon\'t want a fairy story. They\'re all right for girls, I s\'pose, but I\nwant something exciting . . . lots of killing and shooting in it, and a\nhouse on fire, and in\'trusting things like that.""\n\nFortunately for Anne, Marilla called out at this moment from her room.\n\n""Anne, Diana\'s signaling at a great rate. You\'d better see what she\nwants.""\n\nAnne ran to the east gable and saw flashes of light coming through the\ntwilight from Diana\'s window in groups of five, which meant, according\nto their old childish code, ""Come over at once for I have something\nimportant to reveal."" Anne threw her white shawl over her head and\nhastened through the Haunted Wood and across Mr. Bell\'s pasture corner\nto Orchard Slope.\n\n""I\'ve good news for you, Anne,"" said Diana. ""Mother and I have just\ngot home from Carmody, and I saw Mary Sentner from Spencer vale in\nMr. Blair\'s store. She says the old Copp girls on the Tory Road have a\nwillow-ware platter and she thinks it\'s exactly like the one we had at\nthe supper. She says they\'ll likely sell it, for Martha Copp has never\nbeen known to keep anything she COULD sell; but if they won\'t there\'s a\nplatter at Wesley Keyson\'s at Spencervale and she knows they\'d sell it,\nbut she isn\'t sure it\'s just the same kind as Aunt Josephine\'s.""\n\n""I\'ll go right over to Spencervale after it tomorrow,"" said Anne\nresolutely, ""and you must come with me. It will be such a weight off\nmy mind, for I have to go to town day after tomorrow and how can I face\nyour Aunt Josephine without a willow-ware platter? It would be even\nworse than the time I had to confess about jumping on the spare room\nbed.""\n\nBoth girls laughed over the old memory . . . concerning which, if any of\nmy readers are ignorant and curious, I must refer them to Anne\'s earlier\nhistory.\n\nThe next afternoon the girls fared forth on their platter hunting\nexpedition. It was ten miles to Spencervale and the day was not\nespecially pleasant for traveling. It was very warm and windless, and\nthe dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six\nweeks of dry weather.\n\n""Oh, I do wish it would rain soon,"" sighed Anne. ""Everything is so\nparched up. The poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem\nto be stretching out their hands pleading for rain. As for my garden, it\nhurts me every time I go into it. I suppose I shouldn\'t complain about\na garden when the farmers\' crops are suffering so. Mr. Harrison says his\npastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get a bite to\neat and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their\neyes.""\n\nAfter a wearisome drive the girls reached Spencervale and turned down\nthe ""Tory"" Road . . . a green, solitary highway where the strips of grass\nbetween the wheel tracks bore evidence to lack of travel. Along most of\nits extent it was lined with thick-set young spruces crowding down\nto the roadway, with here and there a break where the back field of\na Spencervale farm came out to the fence or an expanse of stumps was\naflame with fireweed and goldenrod.\n\n""Why is it called the Tory Road?"" asked Anne.\n\n""Mr. Allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove\nbecause there are no trees in it,"" said Diana, ""for nobody lives along\nthe road except the Copp girls and old Martin Bovyer at the further end,\nwho is a Liberal. The Tory government ran the road through when they\nwere in power just to show they were doing something.""\n\nDiana\'s father was a Liberal, for which reason she and Anne never\ndiscussed politics. Green Gables folk had always been Conservatives.\n\nFinally the girls came to the old Copp homestead . . . a place of such\nexceeding external neatness that even Green Gables would have suffered\nby contrast. The house was a very old-fashioned one, situated on a\nslope, which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement\nunder one end. The house and out-buildings were all whitewashed to a\ncondition of blinding perfection and not a weed was visible in the prim\nkitchen garden surrounded by its white paling.\n\n""The shades are all down,"" said Diana ruefully. ""I believe that nobody\nis home.""\n\nThis proved to be the case. The girls looked at each other in\nperplexity.\n\n""I don\'t know what to do,"" said Anne. ""If I were sure the platter was\nthe right kind I would not mind waiting until they came home. But if it\nisn\'t it may be too late to go to Wesley Keyson\'s afterward.""\n\nDiana looked at a certain little square window over the basement.\n\n""That is the pantry window, I feel sure,"" she said, ""because this house\nis just like Uncle Charles\' at Newbridge, and that is their pantry\nwindow. The shade isn\'t down, so if we climbed up on the roof of that\nlittle house we could look into the pantry and might be able to see the\nplatter. Do you think it would be any harm?""\n\n""No, I don\'t think so,"" decided Anne, after due reflection, ""since our\nmotive is not idle curiosity.""\n\nThis important point of ethics being settled, Anne prepared to mount the\naforesaid ""little house,"" a construction of lathes, with a peaked roof,\nwhich had in times past served as a habitation for ducks. The Copp girls\nhad given up keeping ducks . . . ""because they were such untidy birds"". .\n. and the house had not been in use for some years, save as an abode of\ncorrection for setting hens. Although scrupulously whitewashed it had\nbecome somewhat shaky, and Anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up\nfrom the vantage point of a keg placed on a box.\n\n""I\'m afraid it won\'t bear my weight,"" she said as she gingerly stepped\non the roof.\n\n""Lean on the window sill,"" advised Diana, and Anne accordingly leaned.\nMuch to her delight, she saw, as she peered through the pane, a\nwillow-ware platter, exactly such as she was in quest of, on the shelf\nin front of the window. So much she saw before the catastrophe came. In\nher joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing, incautiously\nceased to lean on the window sill, gave an impulsive little hop of\npleasure . . . and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up\nto her armpits, and there she hung, quite unable to extricate herself.\nDiana dashed into the duck house and, seizing her unfortunate friend by\nthe waist, tried to draw her down.\n\n""Ow . . . don\'t,"" shrieked poor Anne. ""There are some long splinters\nsticking into me. See if you can put something under my feet . . . then\nperhaps I can draw myself up.""\n\nDiana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and Anne found\nthat it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for\nher feet. But she could not release herself.\n\n""Could I pull you out if I crawled up?"" suggested Diana.\n\nAnne shook her head hopelessly.\n\n""No . . . the splinters hurt too badly. If you can find an axe you might\nchop me out, though. Oh dear, I do really begin to believe that I was\nborn under an ill-omened star.""\n\nDiana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found.\n\n""I\'ll have to go for help,"" she said, returning to the prisoner.\n\n""No, indeed, you won\'t,"" said Anne vehemently. ""If you do the story of\nthis will get out everywhere and I shall be ashamed to show my face.\nNo, we must just wait until the Copp girls come home and bind them\nto secrecy. They\'ll know where the axe is and get me out. I\'m not\nuncomfortable, as long as I keep perfectly still . . .  not uncomfortable\nin BODY I mean. I wonder what the Copp girls value this house at. I\nshall have to pay for the damage I\'ve done, but I wouldn\'t mind that if\nI were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their\npantry window. My sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind I\nwant and if Miss Copp will only sell it to me I shall be resigned to\nwhat has happened.""\n\n""What if the Copp girls don\'t come home until after night . . . or till\ntomorrow?"" suggested Diana.\n\n""If they\'re not back by sunset you\'ll have to go for other assistance,\nI suppose,"" said Anne reluctantly, ""but you mustn\'t go until you really\nhave to. Oh dear, this is a dreadful predicament. I wouldn\'t mind my\nmisfortunes so much if they were romantic, as Mrs. Morgan\'s heroines\'\nalways are, but they are always just simply ridiculous. Fancy what the\nCopp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girl\'s\nhead and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses.\nListen . . . is that a wagon? No, Diana, I believe it is thunder.""\n\nThunder it was undoubtedly, and Diana, having made a hasty pilgrimage\naround the house, returned to announce that a very black cloud was\nrising rapidly in the northwest.\n\n""I believe we\'re going to have a heavy thunder-shower,"" she exclaimed in\ndismay, ""Oh, Anne, what will we do?""\n\n""We must prepare for it,"" said Anne tranquilly. A thunderstorm seemed a\ntrifle in comparison with what had already happened. ""You\'d better drive\nthe horse and buggy into that open shed. Fortunately my parasol is in\nthe buggy. Here . . . take my hat with you. Marilla told me I was a goose\nto put on my best hat to come to the Tory Road and she was right, as she\nalways is.""\n\nDiana untied the pony and drove into the shed, just as the first heavy\ndrops of rain fell. There she sat and watched the resulting downpour,\nwhich was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see Anne through it,\nholding the parasol bravely over her bare head. There was not a great\ndeal of thunder, but for the best part of an hour the rain came\nmerrily down. Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an\nencouraging hand to her friend; But conversation at that distance was\nquite out of the question. Finally the rain ceased, the sun came out,\nand Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard.\n\n""Did you get very wet?"" she asked anxiously.\n\n""Oh, no,"" returned Anne cheerfully. ""My head and shoulders are quite\ndry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the\nlathes. Don\'t pity me, Diana, for I haven\'t minded it at all. I kept\nthinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be\nfor it, and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the\ndrops began to fall. I imagined out a most interesting dialogue between\nthe asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush\nand the guardian spirit of the garden. When I go home I mean to write\nit down. I wish I had a pencil and paper to do it now, because I daresay\nI\'ll forget the best parts before I reach home.""\n\nDiana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper\nin the box of the buggy. Anne folded up her dripping parasol, put on her\nhat, spread the wrapping paper on a shingle Diana handed up, and wrote\nout her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as\nfavorable to literature. Nevertheless, the result was quite pretty, and\nDiana was ""enraptured"" when Anne read it to her.\n\n""Oh, Anne, it\'s sweet . . . just sweet. DO send it to the \'Canadian\nWoman.\'""\n\nAnne shook her head.\n\n""Oh, no, it wouldn\'t be suitable at all. There is no PLOT in it, you\nsee. It\'s just a string of fancies. I like writing such things, but of\ncourse nothing of the sort would ever do for publication, for editors\ninsist on plots, so Priscilla says. Oh, there\'s Miss Sarah Copp now.\nPLEASE, Diana, go and explain.""\n\nMiss Sarah Copp was a small person, garbed in shabby black, with a hat\nchosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well.\nShe looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious\ntableau in her yard, but when she heard Diana\'s explanation she was all\nsympathy. She hurriedly unlocked the back door, produced the axe, and\nwith a few skillfull blows set Anne free. The latter, somewhat tired\nand stiff, ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully\nemerged into liberty once more.\n\n""Miss Copp,"" she said earnestly. ""I assure you I looked into your pantry\nwindow only to discover if you had a willow-ware platter. I didn\'t see\nanything else--I didn\'t LOOK for anything else.""\n\n""Bless you, that\'s all right,"" said Miss Sarah amiably. ""You needn\'t\nworry--there\'s no harm done. Thank goodness, we Copps keep our pantries\npresentable at all times and don\'t care who sees into them. As for that\nold duckhouse, I\'m glad it\'s smashed, for maybe now Martha will agree to\nhaving it taken down. She never would before for fear it might come in\nhandy sometime and I\'ve had to whitewash it every spring. But you might\nas well argue with a post as with Martha. She went to town today--I\ndrove her to the station. And you want to buy my platter. Well, what\nwill you give for it?""\n\n""Twenty dollars,"" said Anne, who was never meant to match business wits\nwith a Copp, or she would not have offered her price at the start.\n\n""Well, I\'ll see,"" said Miss Sarah cautiously. ""That platter is mine\nfortunately, or I\'d never dare to sell it when Martha wasn\'t here. As\nit is, I daresay she\'ll raise a fuss. Martha\'s the boss of this\nestablishment I can tell you. I\'m getting awful tired of living under\nanother woman\'s thumb. But come in, come in. You must be real tired and\nhungry. I\'ll do the best I can for you in the way of tea but I warn you\nnot to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers. Martha\nlocked up all the cake and cheese and preserves afore she went. She\nalways does, because she says I\'m too extravagant with them if company\ncomes.""\n\nThe girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare, and they enjoyed\nMiss Sarah\'s excellent bread and butter and ""cowcumbers"" thoroughly.\nWhen the meal was over Miss Sarah said,\n\n""I don\'t know as I mind selling the platter. But it\'s worth twenty-five\ndollars. It\'s a very old platter.""\n\nDiana gave Anne\'s foot a gentle kick under the table, meaning, ""Don\'t\nagree--she\'ll let it go for twenty if you hold out."" But Anne was not\nminded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter. She\npromptly agreed to give twenty-five and Miss Sarah looked as if she felt\nsorry she hadn\'t asked for thirty.\n\n""Well, I guess you may have it. I want all the money I can scare up just\nnow. The fact is--"" Miss Sarah threw up her head importantly, with a\nproud flush on her thin cheeks--""I\'m going to be married--to Luther\nWallace. He wanted me twenty years ago. I liked him real well but he was\npoor then and father packed him off. I s\'pose I shouldn\'t have let him\ngo so meek but I was timid and frightened of father. Besides, I didn\'t\nknow men were so skurse.""\n\nWhen the girls were safely away, Diana driving and Anne holding\nthe coveted platter carefully on her lap, the green, rain-freshened\nsolitudes of the Tory Road were enlivened by ripples of girlish\nlaughter.\n\n""I\'ll amuse your Aunt Josephine with the \'strange eventful history\' of\nthis afternoon when I go to town tomorrow. We\'ve had a rather trying\ntime but it\'s over now. I\'ve got the platter, and that rain has laid the\ndust beautifully. So \'all\'s well that ends well.\'""\n\n""We\'re not home yet,"" said Diana rather pessimistically, ""and there\'s\nno telling what may happen before we are. You\'re such a girl to have\nadventures, Anne.""\n\n""Having adventures comes natural to some people,"" said Anne serenely.\n""You just have a gift for them or you haven\'t.""\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nJust a Happy Day\n\n\n""After all,"" Anne had said to Marilla once, ""I believe the nicest and\nsweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful\nor exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures,\nfollowing one another softly, like pearls slipping off a string.""\n\nLife at Green Gables was full of just such days, for Anne\'s adventures\nand misadventures, like those of other people, did not all happen at\nonce, but were sprinkled over the year, with long stretches of harmless,\nhappy days between, filled with work and dreams and laughter and\nlessons. Such a day came late in August. In the forenoon Anne and Diana\nrowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick ""sweet\ngrass"" and paddle in the surf, over which the wind was harping an old\nlyric learned when the world was young.\n\nIn the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul.\nShe found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir\ngrove that sheltered the house on the north, absorbed in a book of fairy\ntales. He sprang up radiantly at sight of her.\n\n""Oh, I\'m so glad you\'ve come, teacher,"" he said eagerly, ""because\nGrandma\'s away. You\'ll stay and have tea with me, won\'t you? It\'s so\nlonesome to have tea all by oneself. YOU know, teacher. I\'ve had serious\nthoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down and eat her tea with me,\nbut I expect Grandma wouldn\'t approve. She says the French have to be\nkept in their place. And anyhow, it\'s difficult to talk with Young Mary\nJoe. She just laughs and says, \'Well, yous do beat all de kids I ever\nknowed.\' That isn\'t my idea of conversation.""\n\n""Of course I\'ll stay to tea,"" said Anne gaily. ""I was dying to be asked.\nMy mouth has been watering for some more of your grandma\'s delicious\nshortbread ever since I had tea here before.""\n\nPaul looked very sober.\n\n""If it depended on me, teacher,"" he said, standing before Anne with his\nhands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden\ncare, ""You should have shortbread with a right good will. But it depends\non Mary Joe. I heard Grandma tell her before she left that she wasn\'t to\ngive me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys\' stomachs.\nBut maybe Mary Joe will cut some for you if I promise I won\'t eat any.\nLet us hope for the best.""\n\n""Yes, let us,"" agreed Anne, whom this cheerful philosophy suited\nexactly, ""and if Mary Joe proves hard-hearted and won\'t give me any\nshortbread it doesn\'t matter in the least, so you are not to worry over\nthat.""\n\n""You\'re sure you won\'t mind if she doesn\'t?"" said Paul anxiously.\n\n""Perfectly sure, dear heart.""\n\n""Then I won\'t worry,"" said Paul, with a long breath of relief,\n""especially as I really think Mary Joe will listen to reason. She\'s not\na naturally unreasonable person, but she has learned by experience that\nit doesn\'t do to disobey Grandma\'s orders. Grandma is an excellent woman\nbut people must do as she tells them. She was very much pleased with\nme this morning because I managed at last to eat all my plateful of\nporridge. It was a great effort but I succeeded. Grandma says she thinks\nshe\'ll make a man of me yet. But, teacher, I want to ask you a very\nimportant question. You will answer it truthfully, won\'t you?""\n\n""I\'ll try,"" promised Anne.\n\n""Do you think I\'m wrong in my upper story?"" asked Paul, as if his very\nexistence depended on her reply.\n\n""Goodness, no, Paul,"" exclaimed Anne in amazement. ""Certainly you\'re\nnot. What put such an idea into your head?""\n\n""Mary Joe . . . but she didn\'t know I heard her. Mrs. Peter Sloane\'s\nhired girl, Veronica, came to see Mary Joe last evening and I heard them\ntalking in the kitchen as I was going through the hall. I heard Mary Joe\nsay, \'Dat Paul, he is de queeres\' leetle boy. He talks dat queer. I tink\ndere\'s someting wrong in his upper story.\' I couldn\'t sleep last night\nfor ever so long, thinking of it, and wondering if Mary Joe was right. I\ncouldn\'t bear to ask Grandma about it somehow, but I made up my mind I\'d\nask you. I\'m so glad you think I\'m all right in my upper story.""\n\n""Of course you are. Mary Joe is a silly, ignorant girl, and you are\nnever to worry about anything she says,"" said Anne indignantly, secretly\nresolving to give Mrs. Irving a discreet hint as to the advisability of\nrestraining Mary Joe\'s tongue.\n\n""Well, that\'s a weight off my mind,"" said Paul. ""I\'m perfectly happy\nnow, teacher, thanks to you. It wouldn\'t be nice to have something wrong\nin your upper story, would it, teacher? I suppose the reason Mary\nJoe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things\nsometimes.""\n\n""It is a rather dangerous practice,"" admitted Anne, out of the depths of\nher own experience.\n\n""Well, by and by I\'ll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can\nsee for yourself if there\'s anything queer in them,"" said Paul, ""but\nI\'ll wait till it begins to get dark. That is the time I ache to tell\npeople things, and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to tell Mary\nJoe. But after this I won\'t, if it makes her imagine I\'m wrong in my\nupper story. I\'ll just ache and bear it.""\n\n""And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and tell\nme your thoughts,"" suggested Anne, with all the gravity that endeared\nher to children, who so dearly love to be taken seriously.\n\n""Yes, I will. But I hope Davy won\'t be there when I go because he makes\nfaces at me. I don\'t mind VERY much because he is such a little boy and\nI am quite a big one, but still it is not pleasant to have faces made\nat you. And Davy makes such terrible ones. Sometimes I am frightened he\nwill never get his face straightened out again. He makes them at me\nin church when I ought to be thinking of sacred things. Dora likes me\nthough, and I like her, but not so well as I did before she told\nMinnie May Barry that she meant to marry me when I grew up. I may marry\nsomebody when I grow up but I\'m far too young to be thinking of it yet,\ndon\'t you think, teacher?""\n\n""Rather young,"" agreed teacher.\n\n""Speaking of marrying, reminds me of another thing that has been\ntroubling me of late,"" continued Paul. ""Mrs. Lynde was down here one\nday last week having tea with Grandma, and Grandma made me show her\nmy little mother\'s picture . . . the one father sent me for my birthday\npresent. I didn\'t exactly want to show it to Mrs. Lynde. Mrs. Lynde is a\ngood, kind woman, but she isn\'t the sort of person you want to show your\nmother\'s picture to. YOU know, teacher. But of course I obeyed Grandma.\nMrs. Lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking, and\nmust have been an awful lot younger than father. Then she said, \'Some of\nthese days your pa will be marrying again likely. How will you like to\nhave a new ma, Master Paul?\' Well, the idea almost took my breath away,\nteacher, but I wasn\'t going to let Mrs. Lynde see THAT. I just looked\nher straight in the face . . . like this . . . and I said, \'Mrs. Lynde,\nfather made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and I could\ntrust him to pick out just as good a one the second time.\' And I CAN\ntrust him, teacher. But still, I hope, if he ever does give me a new\nmother, he\'ll ask my opinion about her before it\'s too late. There\'s\nMary Joe coming to call us to tea. I\'ll go and consult with her about\nthe shortbread.""\n\nAs a result of the ""consultation,"" Mary Joe cut the shortbread and added\na dish of preserves to the bill of fare. Anne poured the tea and she\nand Paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room whose windows\nwere open to the gulf breezes, and they talked so much ""nonsense"" that\nMary Joe was quite scandalized and told Veronica the next evening that\n""de school mees"" was as queer as Paul. After tea Paul took Anne up to\nhis room to show her his mother\'s picture, which had been the mysterious\nbirthday present kept by Mrs. Irving in the bookcase. Paul\'s little\nlow-ceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was\nsetting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew\nclose to the square, deep-set window. From out this soft glow and glamor\nshone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes, that was hanging\non the wall at the foot of the bed.\n\n""That\'s my little mother,"" said Paul with loving pride. ""I got Grandma\nto hang it there where I\'d see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the\nmorning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because\nit just seems as if my little mother was right here with me. Father knew\njust what I would like for a birthday present, although he never asked\nme. Isn\'t it wonderful how much fathers DO know?""\n\n""Your mother was very lovely, Paul, and you look a little like her. But\nher eyes and hair are darker than yours.""\n\n""My eyes are the same color as father\'s,"" said Paul, flying about the\nroom to heap all available cushions on the window seat, ""but father\'s\nhair is gray. He has lots of it, but it is gray. You see, father is\nnearly fifty. That\'s ripe old age, isn\'t it? But it\'s only OUTSIDE he\'s\nold. INSIDE he\'s just as young as anybody. Now, teacher, please sit\nhere; and I\'ll sit at your feet. May I lay my head against your knee?\nThat\'s the way my little mother and I used to sit. Oh, this is real\nsplendid, I think.""\n\n""Now, I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer,""\nsaid Anne, patting the mop of curls at her side. Paul never needed any\ncoaxing to tell his thoughts . . . at least, to congenial souls.\n\n""I thought them out in the fir grove one night,"" he said dreamily. ""Of\ncourse I didn\'t BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them. YOU know, teacher. And\nthen I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary\nJoe. Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the\nbench beside her and I said, \'Mary Joe, do you know what I think? I\nthink the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies\ndwell.\' And Mary Joe said, \'Well, yous are de queer one. Dare ain\'t no\nsuch ting as fairies.\' I was very much provoked. Of course, I knew there\nare no fairies; but that needn\'t prevent my thinking there is. You know,\nteacher. But I tried again quite patiently. I said, \'Well then, Mary\nJoe, do you know what I think? I think an angel walks over the world\nafter the sun sets . . . a great, tall, white angel, with silvery folded\nwings . . .  and sings the flowers and birds to sleep. Children can hear\nhim if they know how to listen.\' Then Mary Joe held up her hands all\nover flour and said, \'Well, yous are de queer leetle boy. Yous make\nme feel scare.\' And she really did looked scared. I went out then and\nwhispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden. There was a little\nbirch tree in the garden and it died. Grandma says the salt spray\nkilled it; but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who\nwandered away to see the world and got lost. And the little tree was so\nlonely it died of a broken heart.""\n\n""And when the poor, foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and\ncomes back to her tree HER heart will break,"" said Anne.\n\n""Yes; but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences, just as\nif they were real people,"" said Paul gravely. ""Do you know what I think\nabout the new moon, teacher? I think it is a little golden boat full of\ndreams.""\n\n""And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your\nsleep.""\n\n""Exactly, teacher. Oh, you DO know. And I think the violets are little\nsnips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the\nstars to shine through. And the buttercups are made out of old sunshine;\nand I think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven.\nNow, teacher, do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts?""\n\n""No, laddie dear, they are not queer at all; they are strange and\nbeautiful thoughts for a little boy to think, and so people who couldn\'t\nthink anything of the sort themselves, if they tried for a hundred\nyears, think them queer. But keep on thinking them, Paul  . . . some day\nyou are going to be a poet, I believe.""\n\nWhen Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood\nwaiting to be put to bed. Davy was sulky; and when Anne had undressed\nhim he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow.\n\n""Davy, you have forgotten to say your prayers,"" said Anne rebukingly.\n\n""No, I didn\'t forget,"" said Davy defiantly, ""but I ain\'t going to say\nmy prayers any more. I\'m going to give up trying to be good, \'cause no\nmatter how good I am you\'d like Paul Irving better. So I might as well\nbe bad and have the fun of it.""\n\n""I don\'t like Paul Irving BETTER,"" said Anne seriously. ""I like you just\nas well, only in a different way.""\n\n""But I want you to like me the same way,"" pouted Davy.\n\n""You can\'t like different people the same way. You don\'t like Dora and\nme the same way, do you?""\n\nDavy sat up and reflected.\n\n""No . . . o . . . o,"" he admitted at last, ""I like Dora because she\'s my\nsister but I like you because you\'re YOU.""\n\n""And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy,"" said\nAnne gaily.\n\n""Well, I kind of wish I\'d said my prayers then,"" said Davy, convinced by\nthis logic. ""But it\'s too much bother getting out now to say them. I\'ll\nsay them twice over in the morning, Anne. Won\'t that do as well?""\n\nNo, Anne was positive it would not do as well. So Davy scrambled out\nand knelt down at her knee. When he had finished his devotions he leaned\nback on his little, bare, brown heels and looked up at her.\n\n""Anne, I\'m gooder than I used to be.""\n\n""Yes, indeed you are, Davy,"" said Anne, who never hesitated to give\ncredit where credit was due.\n\n""I KNOW I\'m gooder,"" said Davy confidently, ""and I\'ll tell you how I\nknow it. Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam, one for me\nand one for Dora. One was a good deal bigger than the other and Marilla\ndidn\'t say which was mine. But I give the biggest piece to Dora. That\nwas good of me, wasn\'t it?""\n\n""Very good, and very manly, Davy.""\n\n""Of course,"" admitted Davy, ""Dora wasn\'t very hungry and she only et\nhalf her slice and then she give the rest to me. But I didn\'t know she\nwas going to do that when I give it to her, so I WAS good, Anne.""\n\nIn the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryad\'s Bubble and saw\nGilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood. She had a\nsudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer. And how manly\nhe looked--the tall, frank-faced fellow, with the clear, straightforward\neyes and the broad shoulders. Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome\nlad, even though he didn\'t look at all like her ideal man. She and Diana\nhad long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes\nseemed exactly similar. He must be very tall and distinguished looking,\nwith melancholy, inscrutable eyes, and a melting, sympathetic voice.\nThere was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert\'s\nphysiognomy, but of course that didn\'t matter in friendship!\n\nGilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked\napprovingly at Anne. If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal\nwoman the description would have answered point for point to Anne, even\nto those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to\nvex her soul. Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy; but a boy has\nhis dreams as have others, and in Gilbert\'s future there was always a\ngirl with big, limpid gray eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a\nflower. He had made up his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of\nits goddess. Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met\nand faced. White Sands youth were a rather ""fast"" set, and Gilbert was\npopular wherever he went. But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne\'s\nfriendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over\nword and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to\npass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that\nevery girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an\ninfluence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals\nand which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In\nGilbert\'s eyes Anne\'s greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped\nto the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls--the small\njealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for\nfavor. Anne held herself apart from all this, not consciously or of\ndesign, but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign\nto her transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and\naspirations.\n\nBut Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words, for he had\nalready too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily\nnip all attempts at sentiment in the bud--or laugh at him, which was ten\ntimes worse.\n\n""You look like a real dryad under that birch tree,"" he said teasingly.\n\n""I love birch trees,"" said Anne, laying her cheek against the creamy\nsatin of the slim bole, with one of the pretty, caressing gestures that\ncame so natural to her.\n\n""Then you\'ll be glad to hear that Mr. Major Spencer has decided to set\nout a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm, by way\nof encouraging the A.V.I.S.,"" said Gilbert. ""He was talking to me about\nit today. Major Spencer is the most progressive and public-spirited\nman in Avonlea. And Mr. William Bell is going to set out a spruce\nhedge along his road front and up his lane. Our Society is getting on\nsplendidly, Anne. It is past the experimental stage and is an accepted\nfact. The older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the\nWhite Sands people are talking of starting one too. Even Elisha Wright\nhas come around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the\npicnic at the shore. They praised our roadsides so highly and said they\nwere so much prettier than in any other part of the Island. And when, in\ndue time, the other farmers follow Mr. Spencer\'s good example and plant\nornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts Avonlea will be the\nprettiest settlement in the province.""\n\n""The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard,"" said Anne, ""and I\nhope they will, because there will have to be a subscription for that,\nand it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair.\nBut the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society\nhadn\'t put it into their thoughts unofficially. Those trees we planted\non the church grounds are flourishing, and the trustees have promised\nme that they will fence in the school grounds next year. If they do I\'ll\nhave an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree; and we\'ll have a\ngarden in the corner by the road.""\n\n""We\'ve succeeded in almost all our plans so far, except in getting the\nold Boulter house removed,"" said Gilbert, ""and I\'ve given THAT up\nin despair. Levi won\'t have it taken down just to vex us. There\'s a\ncontrary streak in all the Boulters and it\'s strongly developed in him.""\n\n""Julia Bell wants to send another committee to him, but I think the\nbetter way will just be to leave him severely alone,"" said Anne sagely.\n\n""And trust to Providence, as Mrs. Lynde says,"" smiled Gilbert.\n""Certainly, no more committees. They only aggravate him. Julia Bell\nthinks you can do anything, if you only have a committee to attempt\nit. Next spring, Anne, we must start an agitation for nice lawns and\ngrounds. We\'ll sow good seed betimes this winter. I\'ve a treatise here\non lawns and lawnmaking and I\'m going to prepare a paper on the subject\nsoon. Well, I suppose our vacation is almost over. School opens Monday.\nHas Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school?""\n\n""Yes; Priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school, so the\nCarmody trustees gave it to Ruby. I\'m sorry Priscilla is not coming\nback, but since she can\'t I\'m glad Ruby has got the school. She will be\nhome for Saturdays and it will seem like old times, to have her and Jane\nand Diana and myself all together again.""\n\nMarilla, just home from Mrs. Lynde\'s, was sitting on the back porch step\nwhen Anne returned to the house.\n\n""Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow,"" she\nsaid. ""Mr. Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants to go\nbefore he has another sick spell.""\n\n""I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning, for I\'ve ever so much\nto do,"" said Anne virtuously. ""For one thing, I\'m going to shift the\nfeathers from my old bedtick to the new one. I ought to have done it\nlong ago but I\'ve just kept putting it off . . .  it\'s such a detestable\ntask. It\'s a very bad habit to put off disagreeable things, and I never\nmean to again, or else I can\'t comfortably tell my pupils not to do it.\nThat would be inconsistent. Then I want to make a cake for Mr. Harrison\nand finish my paper on gardens for the A.V.I.S., and write Stella, and\nwash and starch my muslin dress, and make Dora\'s new apron.""\n\n""You won\'t get half done,"" said Marilla pessimistically. ""I never yet\nplanned to do a lot of things but something happened to prevent me.""\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nThe Way It Often Happens\n\n\nAnne rose betimes the next morning and blithely greeted the fresh day,\nwhen the banners of the sunrise were shaken triumphantly across the\npearly skies. Green Gables lay in a pool of sunshine, flecked with the\ndancing shadows of poplar and willow. Beyond the land was Mr. Harrison\'s\nwheatfield, a great, windrippled expanse of pale gold. The world was\nso beautiful that Anne spent ten blissful minutes hanging idly over the\ngarden gate drinking the loveliness in.\n\nAfter breakfast Marilla made ready for her journey. Dora was to go with\nher, having been long promised this treat.\n\n""Now, Davy, you try to be a good boy and don\'t bother Anne,"" she\nstraitly charged him. ""If you are good I\'ll bring you a striped candy\ncane from town.""\n\nFor alas, Marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people to be\ngood!\n\n""I won\'t be bad on purpose, but s\'posen I\'m bad zacksidentally?"" Davy\nwanted to know.\n\n""You\'ll have to guard against accidents,"" admonished Marilla. ""Anne, if\nMr. Shearer comes today get a nice roast and some steak. If he doesn\'t\nyou\'ll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow.""\n\nAnne nodded.\n\n""I\'m not going to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself\ntoday,"" she said. ""That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and I\'ll\nhave some steak fried for you when you come home at night.""\n\n""I\'m going to help Mr. Harrison haul dulse this morning,"" announced\nDavy. ""He asked me to, and I guess he\'ll ask me to dinner too. Mr.\nHarrison is an awful kind man. He\'s a real sociable man. I hope I\'ll be\nlike him when I grow up. I mean BEHAVE like him . . . I don\'t want to LOOK\nlike him. But I guess there\'s no danger, for Mrs. Lynde says I\'m a very\nhandsome child. Do you s\'pose it\'ll last, Anne? I want to know?""\n\n""I daresay it will,"" said Anne gravely. ""You ARE a handsome boy, Davy,""\n . . . Marilla looked volumes of disapproval . . . ""but you must live up to\nit and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be.""\n\n""And you told Minnie May Barry the other day, when you found her crying\n\'cause some one said she was ugly, that if she was nice and kind and\nloving people wouldn\'t mind her looks,"" said Davy discontentedly. ""Seems\nto me you can\'t get out of being good in this world for some reason or\n\'nother. You just HAVE to behave.""\n\n""Don\'t you want to be good?"" asked Marilla, who had learned a great deal\nbut had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions.\n\n""Yes, I want to be good but not TOO good,"" said Davy cautiously. ""You\ndon\'t have to be very good to be a Sunday School superintendent. Mr.\nBell\'s that, and he\'s a real bad man.""\n\n""Indeed he\'s not,"" said Marila indignantly.\n\n""He is . . . he says he is himself,"" asseverated Davy. ""He said it when\nhe prayed in Sunday School last Sunday. He said he was a vile worm and\na miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest \'niquity. What did he do\nthat was so bad, Marilla? Did he kill anybody? Or steal the collection\ncents? I want to know.""\n\nFortunately Mrs. Lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and\nMarilla made off, feeling that she had escaped from the snare of the\nfowler, and wishing devoutly that Mr. Bell were not quite so highly\nfigurative in his public petitions, especially in the hearing of small\nboys who were always ""wanting to know.""\n\nAnne, left alone in her glory, worked with a will. The floor was swept,\nthe beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and hung out on the\nline. Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers. She mounted to\nthe garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand . . . a navy\nblue cashmere she had worn at fourteen. It was decidedly on the short\nside and as ""skimpy"" as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the\noccasion of her debut at Green Gables; but at least it would not be\nmaterially injured by down and feathers. Anne completed her toilet by\ntying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to\nMatthew over her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the\nkitchen chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her\ncarry the feather bed.\n\nA cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment\nAnne looked into it. There were those seven freckles on her nose,\nmore rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light from the\nunshaded window.\n\n""Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night,"" she thought. ""I\'d\nbetter run down to the pantry and do it now.""\n\nAnne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles.\nOn one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles\nremained. A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle\nlotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were within her reach, she\nstraightway compounded it, much to the disgust of Marilla, who thought\nthat if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden\nduty to leave them there.\n\nAnne scurried down to the pantry, which, always dim from the big willow\ngrowing close to the window, was now almost dark by reason of the shade\ndrawn to exclude flies. Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion\nfrom the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of\na little sponge sacred to the purpose. This important duty done, she\nreturned to her work. Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one\ntick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she\nwas a sight to behold. Her dress was white with down and fluff, and her\nfront hair, escaping from under the handkerchief, was adorned with a\nveritable halo of feathers. At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at\nthe kitchen door.\n\n""That must be Mr. Shearer,"" thought Anne. ""I\'m in a dreadful mess but\nI\'ll have to run down as I am, for he\'s always in a hurry.""\n\nDown flew Anne to the kitchen door. If ever a charitable floor did open\nto swallow up a miserable, befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch\nfloor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment. On the doorstep\nwere standing Priscilla Grant, golden and fair in silk attire, a short,\nstout gray-haired lady in a tweed suit, and another lady, tall\nstately, wonderfully gowned, with a beautiful, highbred face and large,\nblack-lashed violet eyes, whom Anne ""instinctively felt,"" as she would\nhave said in her earlier days, to be Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan.\n\nIn the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of\nAnne\'s mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw. All Mrs.\nMorgan\'s heroines were noted for ""rising to the occasion."" No matter\nwhat their troubles were, they invariably rose to the occasion and\nshowed their superiority over all ills of time, space, and quantity.\nAnne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did\nit, so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired\nAnne Shirley more than at that moment. No matter what her outraged\nfeelings were she did not show them. She greeted Priscilla and was\nintroduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been\narrayed in purple and fine linen. To be sure, it was somewhat of a shock\nto find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be Mrs. Morgan was\nnot Mrs. Morgan at all, but an unknown Mrs. Pendexter, while the stout\nlittle gray-haired woman was Mrs. Morgan; but in the greater shock the\nlesser lost its power. Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and\nthence into the parlor, where she left them while she hastened out to\nhelp Priscilla unharness her horse.\n\n""It\'s dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this,"" apologized\nPriscilla, ""but I did not know till last night that we were coming. Aunt\nCharlotte is going away Monday and she had promised to spend today with\na friend in town. But last night her friend telephoned to her not to\ncome because they were quarantined for scarlet fever. So I suggested we\ncome here instead, for I knew you were longing to see her. We called\nat the White Sands Hotel and brought Mrs. Pendexter with us. She is a\nfriend of aunt\'s and lives in New York and her husband is a millionaire.\nWe can\'t stay very long, for Mrs. Pendexter has to be back at the hotel\nby five o\'clock.""\n\nSeveral times while they were putting away the horse Anne caught\nPriscilla looking at her in a furtive, puzzled way.\n\n""She needn\'t stare at me so,"" Anne thought a little resentfully. ""If she\ndoesn\'t KNOW what it is to change a feather bed she might IMAGINE it.""\n\nWhen Priscilla had gone to the parlor, and before Anne could escape\nupstairs, Diana walked into the kitchen. Anne caught her astonished\nfriend by the arm.\n\n""Diana Barry, who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very moment?\nMrs. Charlotte E. Morgan . . . and a New York millionaire\'s wife . . . and\nhere I am like THIS . . . and NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE FOR DINNER BUT A\nCOLD HAM BONE, Diana!""\n\nBy this time Anne had become aware that Diana was staring at her in\nprecisely the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done. It was\nreally too much.\n\n""Oh, Diana, don\'t look at me so,"" she implored. ""YOU, at least, must\nknow that the neatest person in the world couldn\'t empty feathers from\none tick into another and remain neat in the process.""\n\n""It . . . it . . . isn\'t the feathers,"" hesitated Diana. ""It\'s . . .\nit\'s . . . your nose, Anne.""\n\n""My nose? Oh, Diana, surely nothing has gone wrong with it!""\n\nAnne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink. One glance\nrevealed the fatal truth. Her nose was a brilliant scarlet!\n\nAnne sat down on the sofa, her dauntless spirit subdued at last.\n\n""What is the matter with it?"" asked Diana, curiosity overcoming\ndelicacy.\n\n""I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it, but I must have used\nthat red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs,"" was the\ndespairing response. ""What shall I do?""\n\n""Wash it off,"" said Diana practically.\n\n""Perhaps it won\'t wash off. First I dye my hair; then I dye my nose.\nMarilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be\npracticable in this case. Well, this is another punishment for vanity\nand I suppose I deserve it . . . though there\'s not much comfort in THAT.\nIt is really almost enough to make one believe in ill-luck, though Mrs.\nLynde says there is no such thing, because everything is foreordained.""\n\nFortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne, somewhat consoled,\nbetook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home. Presently Anne\ncame down again, clothed and in her right mind. The muslin dress she had\nfondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside, so\nshe was forced to content herself with her black lawn. She had the fire\non and the tea steeping when Diana returned; the latter wore HER muslin,\nat least, and carried a covered platter in her hand.\n\n""Mother sent you this,"" she said, lifting the cover and displaying a\nnicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne\'s greatful eyes.\n\nThe chicken was supplemented by light new bread, excellent butter and\ncheese, Marilla\'s fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums, floating\nin their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine. There was a big\nbowlful of pink-and-white asters also, by way of decoration; yet the\nspread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for\nMrs. Morgan.\n\nAnne\'s hungry guests, however, did not seem to think anything was\nlacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment. But\nafter the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was or was\nnot on her bill of fare. Mrs. Morgan\'s appearance might be somewhat\ndisappointing, as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to\neach other; but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist. She had\ntraveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller. She had seen\nmuch of men and women, and crystalized her experiences into witty little\nsentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were\nlistening to one of the people in clever books. But under all her\nsparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true, womanly sympathy\nand kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy\nwon admiration. Nor did she monopolize the conversation. She could draw\nothers out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself, and Anne\nand Diana found themselves chattering freely to her. Mrs. Pendexter said\nlittle; she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips, and ate chicken\nand fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed\nthe impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew. But then, as Anne\nsaid to Diana later on, anybody so divinely beautiful as Mrs. Pendexter\ndidn\'t need to talk; it was enough for her just to LOOK.\n\nAfter dinner they all had a walk through Lover\'s Lane and Violet Vale\nand the Birch Path, then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryad\'s\nBubble, where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour.\nMrs. Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name, and\nlaughed until she cried when she heard the story and Anne\'s dramatic\naccount of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of\ntwilight.\n\n""It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn\'t it?"" said\nAnne, when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again. ""I\ndon\'t know which I enjoyed more . . . listening to Mrs. Morgan or gazing\nat Mrs. Pendexter. I believe we had a nicer time than if we\'d known they\nwere coming and been cumbered with much serving. You must stay to tea\nwith me, Diana, and we\'ll talk it all over.""\n\n""Priscilla says Mrs. Pendexter\'s husband\'s sister is married to an\nEnglish earl; and yet she took a second helping of the plum preserves,""\nsaid Diana, as if the two facts were somehow incompatible.\n\n""I daresay even the English earl himself wouldn\'t have turned up his\naristocratic nose at Marilla\'s plum preserves,"" said Anne proudly.\n\nAnne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen HER nose when\nshe related the day\'s history to Marilla that evening. But she took the\nbottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window.\n\n""I shall never try any beautifying messes again,"" she said, darkly\nresolute. ""They may do for careful, deliberate people; but for anyone so\nhopelessly given over to making mistakes as I seem to be it\'s tempting\nfate to meddle with them.""\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nSweet Miss Lavendar\n\n\nSchool opened and Anne returned to her work, with fewer theories but\nconsiderably more experience. She had several new pupils, six- and\nseven-year-olds just venturing, round-eyed, into a world of wonder.\nAmong them were Davy and Dora. Davy sat with Milty Boulter, who had been\ngoing to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world.\nDora had made a compact at Sunday School the previous Sunday to sit\nwith Lily Sloane; but Lily Sloane not coming the first day, she was\ntemporarily assigned to Mirabel Cotton, who was ten years old and\ntherefore, in Dora\'s eyes, one of the ""big girls.""\n\n""I think school is great fun,"" Davy told Marilla when he got home that\nnight. ""You said I\'d find it hard to sit still and I did . . .  you mostly\ndo tell the truth, I notice . . . but you can wriggle your legs about\nunder the desk and that helps a lot. It\'s splendid to have so many boys\nto play with. I sit with Milty Boulter and he\'s fine. He\'s longer than\nme but I\'m wider. It\'s nicer to sit in the back seats but you can\'t sit\nthere till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor. Milty drawed a\npicture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he\nmade pictures of Anne like that I\'d lick him at recess. I thought first\nI\'d draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it, but I was afraid it\nwould hurt his feelings, and Anne says you should never hurt anyone\'s\nfeelings. It seems it\'s dreadful to have your feelings hurt. It\'s better\nto knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something.\nMilty said he wasn\'t scared of me but he\'d just as soon call it somebody\nelse to \'blige me, so he rubbed out Anne\'s name and printed Barbara\nShaw\'s under it. Milty doesn\'t like Barbara \'cause she calls him a sweet\nlittle boy and once she patted him on his head.""\n\nDora said primly that she liked school; but she was very quiet, even\nfor her; and when at twilight Marilla bade her go upstairs to bed she\nhesitated and began to cry.\n\n""I\'m . . . I\'m frightened,"" she sobbed. ""I . . . I don\'t want to go\nupstairs alone in the dark.""\n\n""What notion have you got into your head now?"" demanded Marilla. ""I\'m\nsure you\'ve gone to bed alone all summer and never been frightened\nbefore.""\n\nDora still continued to cry, so Anne picked her up, cuddled her\nsympathetically, and whispered,\n\n""Tell Anne all about it, sweetheart. What are you frightened of?""\n\n""Of . . . of Mirabel Cotton\'s uncle,"" sobbed Dora. ""Mirabel Cotton told me\nall about her family today in school. Nearly everybody in her family has\ndied . . . all her grandfathers and grandmothers and ever so many uncles\nand aunts. They have a habit of dying, Mirabel says. Mirabel\'s awful\nproud of having so many dead relations, and she told me what they all\ndied of, and what they said, and how they looked in their coffins. And\nMirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after\nhe was buried. Her mother saw him. I don\'t mind the rest so much but I\ncan\'t help thinking about that uncle.""\n\nAnne went upstairs with Dora and sat by her until she fell asleep. The\nnext day Mirabel Cotton was kept in at recess and ""gently but firmly""\ngiven to understand that when you were so unfortunate as to possess an\nuncle who persisted in walking about houses after he had been decently\ninterred it was not in good taste to talk about that eccentric gentleman\nto your deskmate of tender years. Mirabel thought this very harsh. The\nCottons had not much to boast of. How was she to keep up her prestige\namong her schoolmates if she were forbidden to make capital out of the\nfamily ghost?\n\nSeptember slipped by into a gold and crimson graciousness of October.\nOne Friday evening Diana came over.\n\n""I\'d a letter from Ella Kimball today, Anne, and she wants us to go over\nto tea tomorrow afternoon to meet her cousin, Irene Trent, from town.\nBut we can\'t get one of our horses to go, for they\'ll all be in use\ntomorrow, and your pony is lame . . . so I suppose we can\'t go.""\n\n""Why can\'t we walk?"" suggested Anne. ""If we go straight back through the\nwoods we\'ll strike the West Grafton road not far from the Kimball place.\nI was through that way last winter and I know the road. It\'s no more\nthan four miles and we won\'t have to walk home, for Oliver Kimball will\nbe sure to drive us. He\'ll be only too glad of the excuse, for he goes\nto see Carrie Sloane and they say his father will hardly ever let him\nhave a horse.""\n\nIt was accordingly arranged that they should walk, and the following\nafternoon they set out, going by way of Lover\'s Lane to the back of the\nCuthbert farm, where they found a road leading into the heart of acres\nof glimmering beech and maple woods, which were all in a wondrous glow\nof flame and gold, lying in a great purple stillness and peace.\n\n""It\'s as if the year were kneeling to pray in a vast cathedral full of\nmellow stained light, isn\'t it?"" said Anne dreamily. ""It doesn\'t seem\nright to hurry through it, does it? It seems irreverent, like running in\na church.""\n\n""We MUST hurry though,"" said Diana, glancing at her watch. ""We\'ve left\nourselves little enough time as it is.""\n\n""Well, I\'ll walk fast but don\'t ask me to talk,"" said Anne, quickening\nher pace. ""I just want to drink the day\'s loveliness in . . . I feel as if\nshe were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and I\'ll take\na sip at every step.""\n\nPerhaps it was because she was so absorbed in ""drinking it in"" that Anne\ntook the left turning when they came to a fork in the road. She should\nhave taken the right, but ever afterward she counted it the most\nfortunate mistake of her life. They came out finally to a lonely, grassy\nroad, with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings.\n\n""Why, where are we?"" exclaimed Diana in bewilderment. ""This isn\'t the\nWest Grafton road.""\n\n""No, it\'s the base line road in Middle Grafton,"" said Anne, rather\nshamefacedly. ""I must have taken the wrong turning at the fork. I\ndon\'t know where we are exactly, but we must be all of three miles from\nKimballs\' still.""\n\n""Then we can\'t get there by five, for it\'s half past four now,"" said\nDiana, with a despairing look at her watch. ""We\'ll arrive after they\nhave had their tea, and they\'ll have all the bother of getting ours over\nagain.""\n\n""We\'d better turn back and go home,"" suggested Anne humbly. But Diana,\nafter consideration, vetoed this.\n\n""No, we may as well go and spend the evening, since we have come this\nfar.""\n\nA few yards further on the girls came to a place where the road forked\nagain.\n\n""Which of these do we take?"" asked Diana dubiously.\n\nAnne shook her head.\n\n""I don\'t know and we can\'t afford to make any more mistakes. Here is a\ngate and a lane leading right into the wood. There must be a house at\nthe other side. Let us go down and inquire.""\n\n""What a romantic old lane this it,"" said Diana, as they walked along its\ntwists and turns. It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met\nabove, creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could\ngrow. On either hand were brown wood floors, crossed here and there\nby fallen lances of sunlight. All was very still and remote, as if the\nworld and the cares of the world were far away.\n\n""I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest,"" said Anne in\na hushed tone. ""Do you suppose we\'ll ever find our way back to the\nreal world again, Diana? We shall presently come to a palace with a\nspellbound princess in it, I think.""\n\nAround the next turn they came in sight, not indeed of a palace, but of\na little house almost as surprising as a palace would have been in this\nprovince of conventional wooden farmhouses, all as much alike in general\ncharacteristics as if they had grown from the same seed. Anne stopped\nshort in rapture and Diana exclaimed, ""Oh, I know where we are now.\nThat is the little stone house where Miss Lavendar Lewis lives . . . Echo\nLodge, she calls it, I think. I\'ve often heard of it but I\'ve never seen\nit before. Isn\'t it a romantic spot?""\n\n""It\'s the sweetest, prettiest place I ever saw or imagined,"" said Anne\ndelightedly. ""It looks like a bit out of a story book or a dream.""\n\nThe house was a low-eaved structure built of undressed blocks of red\nIsland sandstone, with a little peaked roof out of which peered two\ndormer windows, with quaint wooden hoods over them, and two great\nchimneys. The whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy,\nfinding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts\nto most beautiful bronze and wine-red tints.\n\nBefore the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where\nthe girls were standing opened. The house bounded it on one side; on\nthe three others it was enclosed by an old stone dyke, so overgrown with\nmoss and grass and ferns that it looked like a high, green bank. On the\nright and left the tall, dark spruces spread their palm-like branches\nover it; but below it was a little meadow, green with clover aftermath,\nsloping down to the blue loop of the Grafton River. No other house or\nclearing was in sight . . . nothing but hills and valleys covered with\nfeathery young firs.\n\n""I wonder what sort of a person Miss Lewis is,"" speculated Diana as they\nopened the gate into the garden. ""They say she is very peculiar.""\n\n""She\'ll be interesting then,"" said Anne decidedly. ""Peculiar people are\nalways that at least, whatever else they are or are not. Didn\'t I tell\nyou we would come to an enchanted palace? I knew the elves hadn\'t woven\nmagic over that lane for nothing.""\n\n""But Miss Lavendar Lewis is hardly a spellbound princess,"" laughed\nDiana. ""She\'s an old maid . . . she\'s forty-five and quite gray, I\'ve\nheard.""\n\n""Oh, that\'s only part of the spell,"" asserted Anne confidently. ""At\nheart she\'s young and beautiful still . . . and if we only knew how to\nunloose the spell she would step forth radiant and fair again. But we\ndon\'t know how . . . it\'s always and only the prince who knows that\n. . . and Miss Lavendar\'s prince hasn\'t come yet. Perhaps some fatal\nmischance has befallen him . . . though THAT\'S against the law of all\nfairy tales.""\n\n""I\'m afraid he came long ago and went away again,"" said Diana. ""They say\nshe used to be engaged to Stephan Irving . . . Paul\'s father . . . when\nthey were young. But they quarreled and parted.""\n\n""Hush,"" warned Anne. ""The door is open.""\n\nThe girls paused in the porch under the tendrils of ivy and knocked\nat the open door. There was a patter of steps inside and a rather odd\nlittle personage presented herself . . . a girl of about fourteen, with a\nfreckled face, a snub nose, a mouth so wide that it did really seem as\nif it stretched ""from ear to ear,"" and two long braids of fair hair tied\nwith two enormous bows of blue ribbon.\n\n""Is Miss Lewis at home?"" asked Diana.\n\n""Yes, ma\'am. Come in, ma\'am. I\'ll tell Miss Lavendar you\'re here, ma\'am.\nShe\'s upstairs, ma\'am.""\n\nWith this the small handmaiden whisked out of sight and the girls,\nleft alone, looked about them with delighted eyes. The interior of this\nwonderful little house was quite as interesting as its exterior.\n\nThe room had a low ceiling and two square, small-paned windows,\ncurtained with muslin frills. All the furnishings were old-fashioned,\nbut so well and daintily kept that the effect was delicious. But it must\nbe candidly admitted that the most attractive feature, to two healthy\ngirls who had just tramped four miles through autumn air, was a table,\nset out with pale blue china and laden with delicacies, while little\ngolden-hued ferns scattered over the cloth gave it what Anne would have\ntermed ""a festal air.""\n\n""Miss Lavendar must be expecting company to tea,"" she whispered. ""There\nare six places set. But what a funny little girl she has. She looked\nlike a messenger from pixy land. I suppose she could have told us the\nroad, but I was curious to see Miss Lavendar. S . . . s . . . sh, she\'s\ncoming.""\n\nAnd with that Miss Lavendar Lewis was standing in the doorway. The girls\nwere so surprised that they forgot good manners and simply stared.\nThey had unconsciously been expecting to see the usual type of elderly\nspinster as known to their experience  . . . a rather angular personage,\nwith prim gray hair and spectacles. Nothing more unlike Miss Lavendar\ncould possibly be imagined.\n\nShe was a little lady with snow-white hair beautifully wavy and thick,\nand carefully arranged in becoming puffs and coils. Beneath it was an\nalmost girlish face, pink cheeked and sweet lipped, with big soft brown\neyes and dimples . . . actually dimples. She wore a very dainty gown of\ncream muslin with pale-hued roses on it . . . a gown which would have\nseemed ridiculously juvenile on most women of her age, but which suited\nMiss Lavendar so perfectly that you never thought about it at all.\n\n""Charlotta the Fourth says that you wished to see me,"" she said, in a\nvoice that matched her appearance.\n\n""We wanted to ask the right road to West Grafton,"" said Diana. ""We\nare invited to tea at Mr. Kimball\'s, but we took the wrong path coming\nthrough the woods and came out to the base line instead of the West\nGrafton road. Do we take the right or left turning at your gate?""\n\n""The left,"" said Miss Lavendar, with a hesitating glance at her tea\ntable. Then she exclaimed, as if in a sudden little burst of resolution,\n\n""But oh, won\'t you stay and have tea with me? Please, do. Mr. Kimball\'s\nwill have tea over before you get there. And Charlotta the Fourth and I\nwill be so glad to have you.""\n\nDiana looked mute inquiry at Anne.\n\n""We\'d like to stay,"" said Anne promptly, for she had made up her mind\nthat she wanted to know more of this surprising Miss Lavendar, ""if it\nwon\'t inconvenience you. But you are expecting other guests, aren\'t\nyou?""\n\nMiss Lavendar looked at her tea table again, and blushed.\n\n""I know you\'ll think me dreadfully foolish,"" she said. ""I AM foolish\n. . . and I\'m ashamed of it when I\'m found out, but never unless I AM\nfound out. I\'m not expecting anybody . . . I was just pretending I was.\nYou see, I was so lonely. I love company . . .  that is, the right kind\nof company.. .but so few people ever come here because it is so far out\nof the way. Charlotta the Fourth was lonely too. So I just pretended I\nwas going to have a tea party. I cooked for it . . . and decorated the\ntable for it.. . and set it with my mother\'s wedding china  . . . and I\ndressed up for it."" Diana secretly thought Miss Lavendar quite as\npeculiar as report had pictured her. The idea of a woman of forty-five\nplaying at having a tea party, just as if she were a little girl! But\nAnne of the shining eyes exclaimed joyfuly, ""Oh, do YOU imagine things\ntoo?""\n\nThat ""too"" revealed a kindred spirit to Miss Lavendar.\n\n""Yes, I do,"" she confessed, boldly. ""Of course it\'s silly in anybody as\nold as I am. But what is the use of being an independent old maid if\nyou can\'t be silly when you want to, and when it doesn\'t hurt anybody?\nA person must have some compensations. I don\'t believe I could live at\ntimes if I didn\'t pretend things. I\'m not often caught at it though, and\nCharlotta the Fourth never tells. But I\'m glad to be caught today, for\nyou have really come and I have tea all ready for you. Will you go up to\nthe spare room and take off your hats? It\'s the white door at the head\nof the stairs. I must run out to the kitchen and see that Charlotta the\nFourth isn\'t letting the tea boil. Charlotta the Fourth is a very good\ngirl but she WILL let the tea boil.""\n\nMiss Lavendar tripped off to the kitchen on hospitable thoughts intent\nand the girls found their way up to the spare room, an apartment as\nwhite as its door, lighted by the ivy-hung dormer window and looking, as\nAnne said, like the place where happy dreams grew.\n\n""This is quite an adventure, isn\'t it?"" said Diana. ""And isn\'t Miss\nLavendar sweet, if she IS a little odd? She doesn\'t look a bit like an\nold maid.""\n\n""She looks just as music sounds, I think,"" answered Anne.\n\nWhen they went down Miss Lavendar was carrying in the teapot, and behind\nher, looking vastly pleased, was Charlotta the Fourth, with a plate of\nhot biscuits.\n\n""Now, you must tell me your names,"" said Miss Lavendar. ""I\'m so glad you\nare young girls. I love young girls. It\'s so easy to pretend I\'m a girl\nmyself when I\'m with them. I do hate"" . . . with a little grimace . . . ""to\nbelieve I\'m old. Now, who are you . . .  just for convenience\' sake? Diana\nBarry? And Anne Shirley? May I pretend that I\'ve known you for a hundred\nyears and call you Anne and Diana right away?""\n\n""You, may"" the girls said both together.\n\n""Then just let\'s sit comfily down and eat everything,"" said Miss\nLavendar happily. ""Charlotta, you sit at the foot and help with the\nchicken. It is so fortunate that I made the sponge cake and doughnuts.\nOf course, it was foolish to do it for imaginary guests . . .  I know\nCharlotta the Fourth thought so, didn\'t you, Charlotta? But you see how\nwell it has turned out. Of course they wouldn\'t have been wasted, for\nCharlotta the Fourth and I could have eaten them through time. But\nsponge cake is not a thing that improves with time.""\n\nThat was a merry and memorable meal; and when it was over they all went\nout to the garden, lying in the glamor of sunset.\n\n""I do think you have the loveliest place here,"" said Diana, looking\nround her admiringly.\n\n""Why do you call it Echo Lodge?"" asked Anne.\n\n""Charlotta,"" said Miss Lavendar, ""go into the house and bring out the\nlittle tin horn that is hanging over the clock shelf.""\n\nCharlotta the Fourth skipped off and returned with the horn.\n\n""Blow it, Charlotta,"" commanded Miss Lavendar.\n\nCharlotta accordingly blew, a rather raucous, strident blast. There was\nmoment\'s stillness . . . and then from the woods over the river came a\nmultitude of fairy echoes, sweet, elusive, silvery, as if all the ""horns\nof elfland"" were blowing against the sunset. Anne and Diana exclaimed in\ndelight.\n\n""Now laugh, Charlotta . . . laugh loudly.""\n\nCharlotta, who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her\nto stand on her head, climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud\nand heartily. Back came the echoes, as if a host of pixy people were\nmimicking her laughter in the purple woodlands and along the fir-fringed\npoints.\n\n""People always admire my echoes very much,"" said Miss Lavendar, as if\nthe echoes were her personal property. ""I love them myself. They\nare very good company . . . with a little pretending. On calm evenings\nCharlotta the Fourth and I often sit out here and amuse ourselves with\nthem. Charlotta, take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place.""\n\n""Why do you call her Charlotta the Fourth?"" asked Diana, who was\nbursting with curiosity on this point.\n\n""Just to keep her from getting mixed up with other Charlottas in my\nthoughts,"" said Miss Lavendar seriously. ""They all look so much alike\nthere\'s no telling them apart. Her name isn\'t really Charlotta at all.\nIt is . . . let me see . . . what is it? I THINK it\'s Leonora . . . yes, it\nIS Leonora. You see, it is this way. When mother died ten years ago I\ncouldn\'t stay here alone . . .  and I couldn\'t afford to pay the wages of\na grown-up girl. So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with\nme for board and clothes. Her name really was Charlotta . . . she was\nCharlotta the First. She was just thirteen. She stayed with me till\nshe was sixteen and then she went away to Boston, because she could\ndo better there. Her sister came to stay with me then. Her name was\nJulietta . . . Mrs. Bowman had a weakness for fancy names I think . . .\nbut she looked so like Charlotta that I kept calling her that all the\ntime . . .and she didn\'t mind. So I just gave up trying to remember her\nright name. She was Charlotta the Second, and when she went away Evelina\ncame and she was Charlotta the Third. Now I have Charlotta the Fourth;\nbut when she is sixteen . . . she\'s fourteen now . . .  she will want to\ngo to Boston too, and what I shall do then I really do not know.\nCharlotta the Fourth is the last of the Bowman girls, and the best. The\nother Charlottas always let me see that they thought it silly of me to\npretend things but Charlotta the Fourth never does, no matter what she\nmay really think. I don\'t care what people think about me if they don\'t\nlet me see it.""\n\n""Well,"" said Diana looking regretfully at the setting sun. ""I suppose\nwe must go if we want to get to Mr. Kimball\'s before dark. We\'ve had a\nlovely time, Miss Lewis.""\n\n""Won\'t you come again to see me?"" pleaded Miss Lavendar.\n\nTall Anne put her arm about the little lady.\n\n""Indeed we shall,"" she promised. ""Now that we have discovered you we\'ll\nwear out our welcome coming to see you. Yes, we must go . . .  \'we must\ntear ourselves away,\' as Paul Irving says every time he comes to Green\nGables.""\n\n""Paul Irving?"" There was a subtle change in Miss Lavendar\'s voice. ""Who\nis he? I didn\'t think there was anybody of that name in Avonlea.""\n\nAnne felt vexed at her own heedlessness. She had forgotten about Miss\nLavendar\'s old romance when Paul\'s name slipped out.\n\n""He is a little pupil of mine,"" she explained slowly. ""He came from\nBoston last year to live with his grandmother, Mrs. Irving of the shore\nroad.""\n\n""Is he Stephen Irving\'s son?"" Miss Lavendar asked, bending over her\nnamesake border so that her face was hidden.\n\n""Yes.""\n\n""I\'m going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece,"" said Miss\nLavendar brightly, as if she had not heard the answer to her question.\n""It\'s very sweet, don\'t you think? Mother always loved it. She planted\nthese borders long ago. Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond\nof it. The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in\nEast Grafton with her brother. He fell in love with her at first sight;\nand they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were\nscented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her. He\nalways loved the scent of lavendar after that . . . and that was why he\ngave me the name. Don\'t forget to come back soon, girls dear. We\'ll be\nlooking for you, Charlotta the Fourth and I.""\n\nShe opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through. She looked\nsuddenly old and tired; the glow and radiance had faded from her face;\nher parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever, but\nwhen the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her\nsitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of\nthe garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand.\n\n""She does look lonely,"" said Diana softly. ""We must come often to see\nher.""\n\n""I think her parents gave her the only right and fitting name that could\npossibly be given her,"" said Anne. ""If they had been so blind as to name\nher Elizabeth or Nellie or Muriel she must have been called\nLavendar just the same, I think. It\'s so suggestive of sweetness and\nold-fashioned graces and \'silk attire.\' Now, my name just smacks of\nbread and butter, patchwork and chores.""\n\n""Oh, I don\'t think so,"" said Diana. ""Anne seems to me real stately and\nlike a queen. But I\'d like Kerrenhappuch if it happened to be your\nname. I think people make their names nice or ugly just by what they are\nthemselves. I can\'t bear Josie or Gertie for names now but before I knew\nthe Pye girls I thought them real pretty.""\n\n""That\'s a lovely idea, Diana,"" said Anne enthusiastically. ""Living so\nthat you beautify your name, even if it wasn\'t beautiful to begin with\n. . . making it stand in people\'s thoughts for something so lovely and\npleasant that they never think of it by itself. Thank you, Diana.""\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nOdds and Ends\n\n\n""So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis?"" said Marilla\nat the breakfast table next morning. ""What is she like now? It\'s over\nfifteen years since I saw her last . . . it was one Sunday in Grafton\nchurch. I suppose she has changed a great deal. Davy Keith, when you\nwant something you can\'t reach, ask to have it passed and don\'t spread\nyourself over the table in that fashion. Did you ever see Paul Irving\ndoing that when he was here to meals?""\n\n""But Paul\'s arms are longer\'n mine,"" brumbled Davy. ""They\'ve had eleven\nyears to grow and mine\'ve only had seven. \'Sides, I DID ask, but you\nand Anne was so busy talking you didn\'t pay any \'tention. \'Sides, Paul\'s\nnever been here to any meal escept tea, and it\'s easier to be p\'lite\nat tea than at breakfast. You ain\'t half as hungry. It\'s an awful long\nwhile between supper and breakfast. Now, Anne, that spoonful ain\'t any\nbigger than it was last year and I\'M ever so much bigger.""\n\n""Of course, I don\'t know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I\ndon\'t fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal,"" said Anne, after\nshe had helped Davy to maple syrup, giving him two spoonfuls to pacify\nhim. ""Her hair is snow-white but her face is fresh and almost girlish,\nand she has the sweetest brown eyes . . . such a pretty shade of\nwood-brown with little golden glints in them . . .  and her voice makes\nyou think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up\ntogether.""\n\n""She was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl,"" said Marilla. ""I\nnever knew her very well but I liked her as far as I did know her. Some\nfolks thought her peculiar even then. DAVY, if ever I catch you at such\na trick again you\'ll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else\nis done, like the French.""\n\nMost conversations between Anne and Marilla in the presence of the\ntwins, were punctuated by these rebukes Davy-ward. In this instance,\nDavy, sad to relate, not being able to scoop up the last drops of his\nsyrup with his spoon, had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in\nboth hands and applying his small pink tongue to it. Anne looked at him\nwith such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said,\nhalf shamefacedly, half defiantly,\n\n""There ain\'t any wasted that way.""\n\n""People who are different from other people are always called peculiar,""\nsaid Anne. ""And Miss Lavendar is certainly different, though it\'s hard\nto say just where the difference comes in. Perhaps it is because she is\none of those people who never grow old.""\n\n""One might as well grow old when all your generation do,"" said Marilla,\nrather reckless of her pronouns. ""If you don\'t, you don\'t fit in\nanywhere. Far as I can learn Lavendar Lewis has just dropped out of\neverything. She\'s lived in that out of the way place until everybody has\nforgotten her. That stone house is one of the oldest on the Island. Old\nMr. Lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from England.\nDavy, stop joggling Dora\'s elbow. Oh, I saw you! You needn\'t try to look\ninnocent. What does make you behave so this morning?""\n\n""Maybe I got out of the wrong side of the bed,"" suggested Davy. ""Milty\nBoulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all\nday. His grandmother told him. But which is the right side? And what are\nyou to do when your bed\'s against the wall? I want to know.""\n\n""I\'ve always wondered what went wrong between Stephen Irving and\nLavendar Lewis,"" continued Marilla, ignoring Davy. ""They were certainly\nengaged twenty-five years ago and then all at once it was broken off.\nI don\'t know what the trouble was but it must have been something\nterrible, for he went away to the States and never come home since.""\n\n""Perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all. I think the little\nthings in life often make more trouble than the big things,"" said Anne,\nwith one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have\nbettered. ""Marilla, please don\'t say anything about my being at Miss\nLavendar\'s to Mrs. Lynde. She\'d be sure to ask a hundred questions and\nsomehow I wouldn\'t like it . . . nor Miss Lavendar either if she knew, I\nfeel sure.""\n\n""I daresay Rachel would be curious,"" admitted Marilla, ""though she\nhasn\'t as much time as she used to have for looking after other people\'s\naffairs. She\'s tied home now on account of Thomas; and she\'s feeling\npretty downhearted, for I think she\'s beginning to lose hope of his ever\ngetting better. Rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to\nhim, with all her children settled out west, except Eliza in town; and\nshe doesn\'t like her husband.""\n\nMarilla\'s pronouns slandered Eliza, who was very fond of her husband.\n\n""Rachel says if he\'d only brace up and exert his will power he\'d get\nbetter. But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?""\ncontinued Marilla. ""Thomas Lynde never had any will power to exert. His\nmother ruled him till he married and then Rachel carried it on. It\'s a\nwonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission. But there, I\nshouldn\'t talk so. Rachel has been a good wife to him. He\'d never have\namounted to anything without her, that\'s certain. He was born to be\nruled; and it\'s well he fell into the hands of a clever, capable manager\nlike Rachel. He didn\'t mind her way. It saved him the bother of ever\nmaking up his own mind about anything. Davy, do stop squirming like an\neel.""\n\n""I\'ve nothing else to do,"" protested Davy. ""I can\'t eat any more, and\nit\'s no fun watching you and Anne eat.""\n\n""Well, you and Dora go out and give the hens their wheat,"" said Marilla.\n""And don\'t you try to pull any more feathers out of the white rooster\'s\ntail either.""\n\n""I wanted some feathers for an Injun headdress,"" said Davy sulkily.\n""Milty Boulter has a dandy one, made out of the feathers his mother give\nhim when she killed their old white gobbler. You might let me have some.\nThat rooster\'s got ever so many more\'n he wants.""\n\n""You may have the old feather duster in the garret,"" said Anne, ""and\nI\'ll dye them green and red and yellow for you.""\n\n""You do spoil that boy dreadfully,"" said Marilla, when Davy, with a\nradiant face, had followed prim Dora out. Marilla\'s education had made\ngreat strides in the past six years; but she had not yet been able to\nrid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too\nmany of its wishes indulged.\n\n""All the boys of his class have Indian headdresses, and Davy wants one\ntoo,"" said Anne. ""_I_ know how it feels . . . I\'ll never forget how I used\nto long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them. And Davy\nisn\'t being spoiled. He is improving every day. Think what a difference\nthere is in him since he came here a year ago.""\n\n""He certainly doesn\'t get into as much mischief since he began to go to\nschool,"" acknowledged Marilla. ""I suppose he works off the tendency with\nthe other boys. But it\'s a wonder to me we haven\'t heard from Richard\nKeith before this. Never a word since last May.""\n\n""I\'ll be afraid to hear from him,"" sighed Anne, beginning to clear away\nthe dishes. ""If a letter should come I\'d dread opening it, for fear it\nwould tell us to send the twins to him.""\n\nA month later a letter did come. But it was not from Richard Keith. A\nfriend of his wrote to say that Richard Keith had died of consumption a\nfortnight previously. The writer of the letter was the executor of his\nwill and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to Miss\nMarilla Cuthbert in trust for David and Dora Keith until they came of\nage or married. In the meantime the interest was to be used for their\nmaintenance.\n\n""It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death,""\nsaid Anne soberly. ""I\'m sorry for poor Mr. Keith; but I AM glad that we\ncan keep the twins.""\n\n""It\'s a very good thing about the money,"" said Marilla practically. ""I\nwanted to keep them but I really didn\'t see how I could afford to do\nit, especially when they grew older. The rent of the farm doesn\'t do any\nmore than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money\nshould be spent on them. You do far too much for them as it is. Dora\ndidn\'t need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two\ntails. But now the way is made clear and they are provided for.""\n\nDavy and Dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at\nGreen Gables, ""for good."" The death of an uncle whom they had never seen\ncould not weigh a moment in the balance against that. But Dora had one\nmisgiving.\n\n""Was Uncle Richard buried?"" she whispered to Anne.\n\n""Yes, dear, of course.""\n\n""He . . . he . . . isn\'t like Mirabel Cotton\'s uncle, is he?"" in a still\nmore agitated whisper. ""He won\'t walk about houses after being buried,\nwill he, Anne?""\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nMiss Lavendar\'s Romance\n\n\n""I think I\'ll take a walk through to Echo Lodge this evening,"" said\nAnne, one Friday afternoon in December.\n\n""It looks like snow,"" said Marilla dubiously.\n\n""I\'ll be there before the snow comes and I mean to stay all night. Diana\ncan\'t go because she has company, and I\'m sure Miss Lavendar will be\nlooking for me tonight. It\'s a whole fortnight since I was there.""\n\nAnne had paid many a visit to Echo Lodge since that October day.\nSometimes she and Diana drove around by the road; sometimes they walked\nthrough the woods. When Diana could not go Anne went alone. Between\nher and Miss Lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent, helpful\nfriendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of\nyouth in her heart and soul, and a girl whose imagination and intuition\nsupplied the place of experience. Anne had at last discovered a real\n""kindred spirit,"" while into the little lady\'s lonely, sequestered life\nof dreams Anne and Diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of\nthe outer existence, which Miss Lavendar, ""the world forgetting, by the\nworld forgot,"" had long ceased to share; they brought an atmosphere of\nyouth and reality to the little stone house. Charlotta the Fourth always\ngreeted them with her very widest smile . . . and Charlotta\'s smiles WERE\nfearfully wide . . . loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as\nwell as for their own. Never had there been such ""high jinks"" held in\nthe little stone house as were held there that beautiful, late-lingering\nautumn, when November seemed October over again, and even December aped\nthe sunshine and hazes of summer.\n\nBut on this particular day it seemed as if December had remembered that\nit was time for winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding, with\na windless hush predictive of coming snow. Nevertheless, Anne keenly\nenjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though\nalone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path\nwith merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended\nconversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations\nare apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably\nto talk up to the requirements. In a ""make believe"" assembly of choice\nspirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives\nyou the chance to say just what YOU want to say. Attended by this\ninvisible company, Anne traversed the woods and arrived at the fir lane\njust as broad, feathery flakes began to flutter down softly.\n\nAt the first bend she came upon Miss Lavendar, standing under a big,\nbroad-branching fir. She wore a gown of warm, rich red, and her head and\nshoulders were wrapped in a silvery gray silk shawl.\n\n""You look like the queen of the fir wood fairies,"" called Anne merrily.\n\n""I thought you would come tonight, Anne,"" said Miss Lavendar, running\nforward. ""And I\'m doubly glad, for Charlotta the Fourth is away. Her\nmother is sick and she had to go home for the night. I should have\nbeen very lonely if you hadn\'t come . . . even the dreams and the echoes\nwouldn\'t have been enough company. Oh, Anne, how pretty you are,""\nshe added suddenly, looking up at the tall, slim girl with the soft\nrose-flush of walking on her face. ""How pretty and how young! It\'s so\ndelightful to be seventeen, isn\'t it? I do envy you,"" concluded Miss\nLavendar candidly.\n\n""But you are only seventeen at heart,"" smiled Anne.\n\n""No, I\'m old . . . or rather middle-aged, which is far worse,"" sighed Miss\nLavendar. ""Sometimes I can pretend I\'m not, but at other times I realize\nit. And I can\'t reconcile myself to it as most women seem to. I\'m just\nas rebellious as I was when I discovered my first gray hair. Now,\nAnne, don\'t look as if you were trying to understand. Seventeen CAN\'T\nunderstand. I\'m going to pretend right away that I am seventeen too, and\nI can do it, now that you\'re here. You always bring youth in your hand\nlike a gift. We\'re going to have a jolly evening. Tea first . . . what do\nyou want for tea? We\'ll have whatever you like. Do think of something\nnice and indigestible.""\n\nThere were sounds of riot and mirth in the little stone house that\nnight. What with cooking and feasting and making candy and laughing and\n""pretending,"" it is quite true that Miss Lavendar and Anne comported\nthemselves in a fashion entirely unsuited to the dignity of a spinster\nof forty-five and a sedate schoolma\'am. Then, when they were tired, they\nsat down on the rug before the grate in the parlor, lighted only by the\nsoft fireshine and perfumed deliciously by Miss Lavendar\'s open rose-jar\non the mantel. The wind had risen and was sighing and wailing around\nthe eaves and the snow was thudding softly against the windows, as if a\nhundred storm sprites were tapping for entrance.\n\n""I\'m so glad you\'re here, Anne,"" said Miss Lavendar, nibbling at her\ncandy. ""If you weren\'t I should be blue . . . very blue . . .  almost navy\nblue. Dreams and make-believes are all very well in the daytime and the\nsunshine, but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy. One wants\nreal things then. But you don\'t know this . . . seventeen never knows\nit. At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are\nwaiting for you further on. When I was seventeen, Anne, I didn\'t think\nforty-five would find me a white-haired little old maid with nothing but\ndreams to fill my life.""\n\n""But you aren\'t an old maid,"" said Anne, smiling into Miss Lavendar\'s\nwistful woodbrown eyes. ""Old maids are BORN . . . they don\'t BECOME.""\n\n""Some are born old maids, some achieve old maidenhood, and some have old\nmaidenhood thrust upon them,"" parodied Miss Lavendar whimsically.\n\n""You are one of those who have achieved it then,"" laughed Anne, ""and\nyou\'ve done it so beautifully that if every old maid were like you they\nwould come into the fashion, I think.""\n\n""I always like to do things as well as possible,"" said Miss Lavendar\nmeditatively, ""and since an old maid I had to be I was determined to be\na very nice one. People say I\'m odd; but it\'s just because I follow my\nown way of being an old maid and refuse to copy the traditional pattern.\nAnne, did anyone ever tell you anything about Stephen Irving and me?""\n\n""Yes,"" said Anne candidly, ""I\'ve heard that you and he were engaged\nonce.""\n\n""So we were . . . twenty-five years ago . . . a lifetime ago. And we\nwere to have been married the next spring. I had my wedding dress made,\nalthough nobody but mother and Stephen ever knew THAT. We\'d been engaged\nin a way almost all our lives, you might say. When Stephen was a little\nboy his mother would bring him here when she came to see my mother; and\nthe second time he ever came . . .  he was nine and I was six . . . he\ntold me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to\nmarry me when he grew up. I remember that I said \'Thank you\'; and when\nhe was gone I told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off\nmy mind, because I wasn\'t frightened any more about having to be an old\nmaid. How poor mother laughed!""\n\n""And what went wrong?"" asked Anne breathlessly.\n\n""We had just a stupid, silly, commonplace quarrel. So commonplace that,\nif you\'ll believe me, I don\'t even remember just how it began. I hardly\nknow who was the more to blame for it. Stephen did really begin it, but\nI suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine. He had a rival or\ntwo, you see. I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little.\nHe was a very high-strung, sensitive fellow. Well, we parted in a temper\non both sides. But I thought it would all come right; and it would have\nif Stephen hadn\'t come back too soon. Anne, my dear, I\'m sorry to say""\n. . . Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a\npredilection for murdering people, ""that I am a dreadfully sulky person.\nOh, you needn\'t smile, . . .  it\'s only too true. I DO sulk; and Stephen\ncame back before I had finished sulking. I wouldn\'t listen to him and I\nwouldn\'t forgive him; and so he went away for good. He was too proud to\ncome again. And then I sulked because he didn\'t come. I might have sent\nfor him perhaps, but I couldn\'t humble myself to do that. I was just\nas proud as he was . . . pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination,\nAnne. But I could never care for anybody else and I didn\'t want to.\nI knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry\nanybody who wasn\'t Stephen Irving. Well, it all seems like a dream now,\nof course. How sympathetic you look, Anne . . . as sympathetic as only\nseventeen can look. But don\'t overdo it. I\'m really a very happy,\ncontented little person in spite of my broken heart. My heart did break,\nif ever a heart did, when I realized that Stephen Irving was not coming\nback. But, Anne, a broken heart in real life isn\'t half as dreadful as\nit is in books. It\'s a good deal like a bad tooth . . . though you won\'t\nthink THAT a very romantic simile. It takes spells of aching and gives\nyou a sleepless night now and then, but between times it lets you enjoy\nlife and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the\nmatter with it. And now you\'re looking disappointed. You don\'t think\nI\'m half as interesting a person as you did five minutes ago when you\nbelieved I was always the prey of a tragic memory bravely hidden beneath\nexternal smiles. That\'s the worst . . . or the best . . .  of real life,\nAnne. It WON\'T let you be miserable. It keeps on trying to make you\ncomfortable . . . and succeeding...even when you\'re determined to be\nunhappy and romantic. Isn\'t this candy scrumptious? I\'ve eaten far more\nthan is good for me already but I\'m going to keep recklessly on.""\n\nAfter a little silence Miss Lavendar said abruptly,\n\n""It gave me a shock to hear about Stephen\'s son that first day you were\nhere, Anne. I\'ve never been able to mention him to you since, but I\'ve\nwanted to know all about him. What sort of a boy is he?""\n\n""He is the dearest, sweetest child I ever knew, Miss Lavendar . . .  and\nhe pretends things too, just as you and I do.""\n\n""I\'d like to see him,"" said Miss Lavendar softly, as if talking to\nherself. ""I wonder if he looks anything like the little dream-boy who\nlives here with me . . . MY little dream-boy.""\n\n""If you would like to see Paul I\'ll bring him through with me sometime,""\nsaid Anne.\n\n""I would like it . . . but not too soon. I want to get used to the\nthought. There might be more pain than pleasure in it . . . if he looked\ntoo much like Stephen . . . or if he didn\'t look enough like him. In a\nmonth\'s time you may bring him.""\n\nAccordingly, a month later Anne and Paul walked through the woods to\nthe stone house, and met Miss Lavendar in the lane. She had not been\nexpecting them just then and she turned very pale.\n\n""So this is Stephen\'s boy,"" she said in a low tone, taking Paul\'s hand\nand looking at him as he stood, beautiful and boyish, in his smart\nlittle fur coat and cap. ""He . . . he is very like his father.""\n\n""Everybody says I\'m a chip off the old block,"" remarked Paul, quite at\nhis ease.\n\nAnne, who had been watching the little scene, drew a relieved breath.\nShe saw that Miss Lavendar and Paul had ""taken"" to each other, and that\nthere would be no constraint or stiffness. Miss Lavendar was a very\nsensible person, in spite of her dreams and romance, and after\nthat first little betrayal she tucked her feelings out of sight and\nentertained Paul as brightly and naturally as if he were anybody\'s son\nwho had come to see her. They all had a jolly afternoon together and\nsuch a feast of fat things by way of supper as would have made old Mrs.\nIrving hold up her hands in horror, believing that Paul\'s digestion\nwould be ruined for ever.\n\n""Come again, laddie,"" said Miss Lavendar, shaking hands with him at\nparting.\n\n""You may kiss me if you like,"" said Paul gravely.\n\nMiss Lavendar stooped and kissed him.\n\n""How did you know I wanted to?"" she whispered.\n\n""Because you looked at me just as my little mother used to do when she\nwanted to kiss me. As a rule, I don\'t like to be kissed. Boys don\'t. You\nknow, Miss Lewis. But I think I rather like to have you kiss me. And of\ncourse I\'ll come to see you again. I think I\'d like to have you for a\nparticular friend of mine, if you don\'t object.""\n\n""I . . . I don\'t think I shall object,"" said Miss Lavendar. She turned\nand went in very quickly; but a moment later she was waving a gay and\nsmiling good-bye to them from the window.\n\n""I like Miss Lavendar,"" announced Paul, as they walked through the beech\nwoods. ""I like the way she looked at me, and I like her stone house, and\nI like Charlotta the Fourth. I wish Grandma Irving had a Charlotta the\nFourth instead of a Mary Joe. I feel sure Charlotta the Fourth wouldn\'t\nthink I was wrong in my upper story when I told her what I think about\nthings. Wasn\'t that a splendid tea we had, teacher? Grandma says a boy\nshouldn\'t be thinking about what he gets to eat, but he can\'t help it\nsometimes when he is real hungry. YOU know, teacher. I don\'t think Miss\nLavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didn\'t like\nit. She\'d get things for him he did like. But of course"" . . .  Paul was\nnothing if not fair-minded . . . ""that mightn\'t be very good for him. It\'s\nvery nice for a change though, teacher. YOU know.""\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nA Prophet in His Own Country\n\n\nOne May day Avonlea folks were mildly excited over some ""Avonlea\nNotes,"" signed ""Observer,"" which appeared in the Charlottetown \'Daily\nEnterprise.\' Gossip ascribed the authorship thereof to Charlie Sloane,\npartly because the said Charlie had indulged in similar literary flights\nin times past, and partly because one of the notes seemed to embody a\nsneer at Gilbert Blythe. Avonlea juvenile society persisted in regarding\nGilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane as rivals in the good graces of a\ncertain damsel with gray eyes and an imagination.\n\nGossip, as usual, was wrong. Gilbert Blythe, aided and abetted by Anne,\nhad written the notes, putting in the one about himself as a blind. Only\ntwo of the notes have any bearing on this history:\n\n""Rumor has it that there will be a wedding in our village ere the\ndaisies are in bloom. A new and highly respected citizen will lead to\nthe hymeneal altar one of our most popular ladies.\n\n""Uncle Abe, our well-known weather prophet, predicts a violent storm\nof thunder and lightning for the evening of the twenty-third of May,\nbeginning at seven o\'clock sharp. The area of the storm will extend over\nthe greater part of the Province. People traveling that evening will do\nwell to take umbrellas and mackintoshes with them.""\n\n""Uncle Abe really has predicted a storm for sometime this spring,"" said\nGilbert, ""but do you suppose Mr. Harrison really does go to see Isabella\nAndrews?""\n\n""No,"" said Anne, laughing, ""I\'m sure he only goes to play checkers with\nMr. Harrison Andrews, but Mrs. Lynde says she knows Isabella Andrews\nmust be going to get married, she\'s in such good spirits this spring.""\n\nPoor old Uncle Abe felt rather indignant over the notes. He suspected\nthat ""Observer"" was making fun of him. He angrily denied having assigned\nany particular date for his storm but nobody believed him.\n\nLife in Avonlea continued on the smooth and even tenor of its way.\nThe ""planting"" was put in; the Improvers celebrated an Arbor Day. Each\nImprover set out, or caused to be set out, five ornamental trees. As the\nsociety now numbered forty members, this meant a total of two hundred\nyoung trees. Early oats greened over the red fields; apple orchards\nflung great blossoming arms about the farmhouses and the Snow Queen\nadorned itself as a bride for her husband. Anne liked to sleep with her\nwindow open and let the cherry fragrance blow over her face all night.\nShe thought it very poetical. Marilla thought she was risking her life.\n\n""Thanksgiving should be celebrated in the spring,"" said Anne one evening\nto Marilla, as they sat on the front door steps and listened to the\nsilver-sweet chorus of the frogs. ""I think it would be ever so much\nbetter than having it in November when everything is dead or asleep.\nThen you have to remember to be thankful; but in May one simply can\'t\nhelp being thankful . . .  that they are alive, if for nothing else. I\nfeel exactly as Eve must have felt in the garden of Eden before the\ntrouble began. IS that grass in the hollow green or golden? It seems to\nme, Marilla, that a pearl of a day like this, when the blossoms are out\nand the winds don\'t know where to blow from next for sheer crazy delight\nmust be pretty near as good as heaven.""\n\nMarilla looked scandalized and glanced apprehensively around to make\nsure the twins were not within earshot. They came around the corner of\nthe house just then.\n\n""Ain\'t it an awful nice-smelling evening?"" asked Davy, sniffing\ndelightedly as he swung a hoe in his grimy hands. He had been working\nin his garden. That spring Marilla, by way of turning Davy\'s passion for\nreveling in mud and clay into useful channels, had given him and Dora\na small plot of ground for a garden. Both had eagerly gone to work in\na characteristic fashion. Dora planted, weeded, and watered carefully,\nsystematically, and dispassionately. As a result, her plot was already\ngreen with prim, orderly little rows of vegetables and annuals. Davy,\nhowever, worked with more zeal than discretion; he dug and hoed and\nraked and watered and transplanted so energetically that his seeds had\nno chance for their lives.\n\n""How is your garden coming on, Davy-boy?"" asked Anne.\n\n""Kind of slow,"" said Davy with a sigh. ""I don\'t know why the things\ndon\'t grow better. Milty Boulter says I must have planted them in the\ndark of the moon and that\'s the whole trouble. He says you must never\nsow seeds or kill pork or cut your hair or do any \'portant thing in the\nwrong time of the moon. Is that true, Anne? I want to know.""\n\n""Maybe if you didn\'t pull your plants up by the roots every other day to\nsee how they\'re getting on \'at the other end,\' they\'d do better,"" said\nMarilla sarcastically.\n\n""I only pulled six of them up,"" protested Davy. ""I wanted to see if\nthere was grubs at the roots. Milty Boulter said if it wasn\'t the moon\'s\nfault it must be grubs. But I only found one grub. He was a great big\njuicy curly grub. I put him on a stone and got another stone and smashed\nhim flat. He made a jolly SQUISH I tell you. I was sorry there wasn\'t\nmore of them. Dora\'s garden was planted same time\'s mine and her things\nare growing all right. It CAN\'T be the moon,"" Davy concluded in a\nreflective tone.\n\n""Marilla, look at that apple tree,"" said Anne. ""Why, the thing is human.\nIt is reaching out long arms to pick its own pink skirts daintily up and\nprovoke us to admiration.""\n\n""Those Yellow Duchess trees always bear well,"" said Marilla\ncomplacently. ""That tree\'ll be loaded this year. I\'m real glad. . .\nthey\'re great for pies.""\n\nBut neither Marilla nor Anne nor anybody else was fated to make pies out\nof Yellow Duchess apples that year.\n\nThe twenty-third of May came . . . an unseasonably warm day, as none\nrealized more keenly than Anne and her little beehive of pupils,\nsweltering over fractions and syntax in the Avonlea schoolroom. A hot\nbreeze blew all the forenoon; but after noon hour it died away into a\nheavy stillness. At half past three Anne heard a low rumble of thunder.\nShe promptly dismissed school at once, so that the children might get\nhome before the storm came.\n\nAs they went out to the playground Anne perceived a certain shadow and\ngloom over the world in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining\nbrightly. Annetta Bell caught her hand nervously.\n\n""Oh, teacher, look at that awful cloud!""\n\nAnne looked and gave an exclamation of dismay. In the northwest a mass\nof cloud, such as she had never in all her life beheld before, was\nrapidly rolling up. It was dead black, save where its curled and fringed\nedges showed a ghastly, livid white. There was something about it\nindescribably menacing as it gloomed up in the clear blue sky; now and\nagain a bolt of lightning shot across it, followed by a savage growl. It\nhung so low that it almost seemed to be touching the tops of the wooded\nhills.\n\nMr. Harmon Andrews came clattering up the hill in his truck wagon,\nurging his team of grays to their utmost speed. He pulled them to a halt\nopposite the school.\n\n""Guess Uncle Abe\'s hit it for once in his life, Anne,"" he shouted. ""His\nstorm\'s coming a leetle ahead of time. Did ye ever see the like of that\ncloud? Here, all you young ones, that are going my way, pile in, and\nthose that ain\'t scoot for the post office if ye\'ve more\'n a quarter of\na mile to go, and stay there till the shower\'s over.""\n\nAnne caught Davy and Dora by the hands and flew down the hill, along the\nBirch Path, and past Violet Vale and Willowmere, as fast as the twins\'\nfat legs could go. They reached Green Gables not a moment too soon and\nwere joined at the door by Marilla, who had been hustling her ducks and\nchickens under shelter. As they dashed into the kitchen the light seemed\nto vanish, as if blown out by some mighty breath; the awful cloud rolled\nover the sun and a darkness as of late twilight fell across the world.\nAt the same moment, with a crash of thunder and a blinding glare of\nlightning, the hail swooped down and blotted the landscape out in one\nwhite fury.\n\nThrough all the clamor of the storm came the thud of torn branches\nstriking the house and the sharp crack of breaking glass. In three\nminutes every pane in the west and north windows was broken and the\nhail poured in through the apertures covering the floor with stones, the\nsmallest of which was as big as a hen\'s egg. For three quarters of an\nhour the storm raged unabated and no one who underwent it ever forgot\nit. Marilla, for once in her life shaken out of her composure by sheer\nterror, knelt by her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen, gasping\nand sobbing between the deafening thunder peals. Anne, white as paper,\nhad dragged the sofa away from the window and sat on it with a twin on\neither side. Davy at the first crash had howled, ""Anne, Anne, is it the\nJudgment Day? Anne, Anne, I never meant to be naughty,"" and then\nhad buried his face in Anne\'s lap and kept it there, his little body\nquivering. Dora, somewhat pale but quite composed, sat with her hand\nclasped in Anne\'s, quiet and motionless. It is doubtful if an earthquake\nwould have disturbed Dora.\n\nThen, almost as suddenly as it began, the storm ceased. The hail\nstopped, the thunder rolled and muttered away to the eastward, and the\nsun burst out merry and radiant over a world so changed that it seemed\nan absurd thing to think that a scant three quarters of an hour could\nhave effected such a transformation.\n\nMarilla rose from her knees, weak and trembling, and dropped on her\nrocker. Her face was haggard and she looked ten years older.\n\n""Have we all come out of that alive?"" she asked solemnly.\n\n""You bet we have,"" piped Davy cheerfully, quite his own man again. ""I\nwasn\'t a bit scared either . . . only just at the first. It come on a\nfellow so sudden. I made up my mind quick as a wink that I wouldn\'t\nfight Teddy Sloane Monday as I\'d promised; but now maybe I will. Say,\nDora, was you scared?""\n\n""Yes, I was a little scared,"" said Dora primly, ""but I held tight to\nAnne\'s hand and said my prayers over and over again.""\n\n""Well, I\'d have said my prayers too if I\'d have thought of it,"" said\nDavy; ""but,"" he added triumphantly, ""you see I came through just as safe\nas you for all I didn\'t say them.""\n\nAnne got Marilla a glassful of her potent currant wine . . . HOW potent\nit was Anne, in her earlier days, had had all too good reason to know\n. . . and then they went to the door to look out on the strange scene.\n\nFar and wide was a white carpet, knee deep, of hailstones; drifts of\nthem were heaped up under the eaves and on the steps. When, three or\nfour days later, those hailstones melted, the havoc they had wrought was\nplainly seen, for every green growing thing in the field or garden was\ncut off. Not only was every blossom stripped from the apple trees but\ngreat boughs and branches were wrenched away. And out of the two hundred\ntrees set out by the Improvers by far the greater number were snapped\noff or torn to shreds.\n\n""Can it possibly be the same world it was an hour ago?"" asked Anne,\ndazedly. ""It MUST have taken longer than that to play such havoc.""\n\n""The like of this has never been known in Prince Edward Island,"" said\nMarilla, ""never. I remember when I was a girl there was a bad storm, but\nit was nothing to this. We\'ll hear of terrible destruction, you may be\nsure.""\n\n""I do hope none of the children were caught out in it,"" murmured Anne\nanxiously. As it was discovered later, none of the children had been,\nsince all those who had any distance to go had taken Mr. Andrews\'\nexcellent advice and sought refuge at the post office.\n\n""There comes John Henry Carter,"" said Marilla.\n\nJohn Henry came wading through the hailstones with a rather scared grin.\n\n""Oh, ain\'t this awful, Miss Cuthbert? Mr. Harrison sent me over to see\nif yous had come out all right.""\n\n""We\'re none of us killed,"" said Marilla grimly, ""and none of the\nbuildings was struck. I hope you got off equally well.""\n\n""Yas\'m. Not quite so well, ma\'am. We was struck. The lightning knocked\nover the kitchen chimbly and come down the flue and knocked over\nGinger\'s cage and tore a hole in the floor and went into the sullar.\nYas\'m.""\n\n""Was Ginger hurt?"" queried Anne.\n\n""Yas\'m. He was hurt pretty bad. He was killed."" Later on Anne went over\nto comfort Mr. Harrison. She found him sitting by the table, stroking\nGinger\'s gay dead body with a trembling hand.\n\n""Poor Ginger won\'t call you any more names, Anne,"" he said mournfully.\n\nAnne could never have imagined herself crying on Ginger\'s account, but\nthe tears came into her eyes.\n\n""He was all the company I had, Anne . . . and now he\'s dead. Well, well,\nI\'m an old fool to care so much. I\'ll let on I don\'t care. I know you\'re\ngoing to say something sympathetic as soon as I stop talking . . . but\ndon\'t. If you did I\'d cry like a baby. Hasn\'t this been a terrible\nstorm? I guess folks won\'t laugh at Uncle Abe\'s predictions again. Seems\nas if all the storms that he\'s been prophesying all his life that never\nhappened came all at once. Beats all how he struck the very day though,\ndon\'t it? Look at the mess we have here. I must hustle round and get\nsome boards to patch up that hole in the floor.""\n\nAvonlea folks did nothing the next day but visit each other and\ncompare damages. The roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the\nhailstones, so they walked or rode on horseback. The mail came late with\nill tidings from all over the province. Houses had been struck, people\nkilled and injured; the whole telephone and telegraph system had been\ndisorganized, and any number of young stock exposed in the fields had\nperished.\n\nUncle Abe waded out to the blacksmith\'s forge early in the morning and\nspent the whole day there. It was Uncle Abe\'s hour of triumph and he\nenjoyed it to the full. It would be doing Uncle Abe an injustice to say\nthat he was glad the storm had happened; but since it had to be he was\nvery glad he had predicted it . . . to the very day, too. Uncle Abe forgot\nthat he had ever denied setting the day. As for the trifling discrepancy\nin the hour, that was nothing.\n\nGilbert arrived at Green Gables in the evening and found Marilla and\nAnne busily engaged in nailing strips of oilcloth over the broken\nwindows.\n\n""Goodness only knows when we\'ll get glass for them,"" said Marilla. ""Mr.\nBarry went over to Carmody this afternoon but not a pane could he get\nfor love or money. Lawson and Blair were cleaned out by the Carmody\npeople by ten o\'clock. Was the storm bad at White Sands, Gilbert?""\n\n""I should say so. I was caught in the school with all the children and\nI thought some of them would go mad with fright. Three of them fainted,\nand two girls took hysterics, and Tommy Blewett did nothing but shriek\nat the top of his voice the whole time.""\n\n""I only squealed once,"" said Davy proudly. ""My garden was all smashed\nflat,"" he continued mournfully, ""but so was Dora\'s,"" he added in a tone\nwhich indicated that there was yet balm in Gilead.\n\nAnne came running down from the west gable.\n\n""Oh, Gilbert, have you heard the news? Mr. Levi Boulter\'s old house\nwas struck and burned to the ground. It seems to me that I\'m dreadfully\nwicked to feel glad over THAT, when so much damage has been done.\nMr. Boulter says he believes the A.V.I.S. magicked up that storm on\npurpose.""\n\n""Well, one thing is certain,"" said Gilbert, laughing, ""\'Observer\' has\nmade Uncle Abe\'s reputation as a weather prophet. \'Uncle Abe\'s storm\'\nwill go down in local history. It is a most extraordinary coincidence\nthat it should have come on the very day we selected. I actually have a\nhalf guilty feeling, as if I really had \'magicked\' it up. We may as\nwell rejoice over the old house being removed, for there\'s not much to\nrejoice over where our young trees are concerned. Not ten of them have\nescaped.""\n\n""Ah, well, we\'ll just have to plant them over again next spring,"" said\nAnne philosophically. ""That is one good thing about this world . . . there\nare always sure to be more springs.""\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nAn Avonlea Scandal\n\n\nOne blithe June morning, a fortnight after Uncle Abe\'s storm, Anne came\nslowly through the Green Gables yard from the garden, carrying in her\nhands two blighted stalks of white narcissus.\n\n""Look, Marilla,"" she said sorrowfully, holding up the flowers before the\neyes of a grim lady, with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron, who\nwas going into the house with a plucked chicken, ""these are the only\nbuds the storm spared . . . and even they are imperfect. I\'m so sorry\n. . . I wanted some for Matthew\'s grave. He was always so fond of June\nlilies.""\n\n""I kind of miss them myself,"" admitted Marilla, ""though it doesn\'t seem\nright to lament over them when so many worse things have happened. . .\nall the crops destroyed as well as the fruit.""\n\n""But people have sown their oats over again,"" said Anne comfortingly,\n""and Mr. Harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come\nout all right though late. And my annuals are all coming up again . . .\nbut oh, nothing can replace the June lilies. Poor little Hester Gray\nwill have none either. I went all the way back to her garden last night\nbut there wasn\'t one. I\'m sure she\'ll miss them.""\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s right for you to say such things, Anne, I really\ndon\'t,"" said Marilla severely. ""Hester Gray has been dead for thirty\nyears and her spirit is in heaven . . . I hope.""\n\n""Yes, but I believe she loves and remembers her garden here still,"" said\nAnne. ""I\'m sure no matter how long I\'d lived in heaven I\'d like to look\ndown and see somebody putting flowers on my grave. If I had had a garden\nhere like Hester Gray\'s it would take me more than thirty years, even in\nheaven, to forget being homesick for it by spells.""\n\n""Well, don\'t let the twins hear you talking like that,"" was Marilla\'s\nfeeble protest, as she carried her chicken into the house.\n\nAnne pinned her narcissi on her hair and went to the lane gate, where\nshe stood for awhile sunning herself in the June brightness before\ngoing in to attend to her Saturday morning duties. The world was growing\nlovely again; old Mother Nature was doing her best to remove the traces\nof the storm, and, though she was not to succeed fully for many a moon,\nshe was really accomplishing wonders.\n\n""I wish I could just be idle all day today,"" Anne told a bluebird, who\nwas singing and swinging on a willow bough, ""but a schoolma\'am, who is\nalso helping to bring up twins, can\'t indulge in laziness, birdie. How\nsweet you are singing, little bird. You are just putting the feelings of\nmy heart into song ever so much better than I could myself. Why, who is\ncoming?""\n\nAn express wagon was jolting up the lane, with two people on the front\nseat and a big trunk behind. When it drew near Anne recognized the\ndriver as the son of the station agent at Bright River; but his\ncompanion was a stranger . . . a scrap of a woman who sprang nimbly down\nat the gate almost before the horse came to a standstill. She was a very\npretty little person, evidently nearer fifty than forty, but with rosy\ncheeks, sparkling black eyes, and shining black hair, surmounted by\na wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet. In spite of having driven\neight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped\nout of the proverbial bandbox.\n\n""Is this where Mr. James A. Harrison lives?"" she inquired briskly.\n\n""No, Mr. Harrison lives over there,"" said Anne, quite lost in\nastonishment.\n\n""Well, I DID think this place seemed too tidy . . . MUCH too tidy for\nJames A. to be living here, unless he has greatly changed since I knew\nhim,"" chirped the little lady. ""Is it true that James A. is going to be\nmarried to some woman living in this settlement?""\n\n""No, oh no,"" cried Anne, flushing so guiltily that the stranger looked\ncuriously at her, as if she half suspected her of matrimonial designs on\nMr. Harrison.\n\n""But I saw it in an Island paper,"" persisted the Fair Unknown. ""A friend\nsent a marked copy to me . . . friends are always so ready to do such\nthings. James A.\'s name was written in over \'new citizen.\'""\n\n""Oh, that note was only meant as a joke,"" gasped Anne. ""Mr. Harrison has\nno intention of marrying ANYBODY. I assure you he hasn\'t.""\n\n""I\'m very glad to hear it,"" said the rosy lady, climbing nimbly back to\nher seat in the wagon, ""because he happens to be married already. _I_\nam his wife. Oh, you may well look surprised. I suppose he has been\nmasquerading as a bachelor and breaking hearts right and left. Well,\nwell, James A.,"" nodding vigorously over the fields at the long white\nhouse, ""your fun is over. I am here . . . though I wouldn\'t have bothered\ncoming if I hadn\'t thought you were up to some mischief. I suppose,""\nturning to Anne, ""that parrot of his is as profane as ever?""\n\n""His parrot . . . is dead . . . I THINK,"" gasped poor Anne, who couldn\'t\nhave felt sure of her own name at that precise moment.\n\n""Dead! Everything will be all right then,"" cried the rosy lady\njubilantly. ""I can manage James A. if that bird is out of the way.""\n\nWith which cryptic utterance she went joyfully on her way and Anne flew\nto the kitchen door to meet Marilla.\n\n""Anne, who was that woman?""\n\n""Marilla,"" said Anne solemnly, but with dancing eyes, ""do I look as if I\nwere crazy?""\n\n""Not more so than usual,"" said Marilla, with no thought of being\nsarcastic.\n\n""Well then, do you think I am awake?""\n\n""Anne, what nonsense has got into you? Who was that woman, I say?""\n\n""Marilla, if I\'m not crazy and not asleep she can\'t be such stuff as\ndreams are made of . . . she must be real. Anyway, I\'m sure I couldn\'t\nhave imagined such a bonnet. She says she is Mr. Harrison\'s wife,\nMarilla.""\n\nMarilla stared in her turn.\n\n""His wife! Anne Shirley! Then what has he been passing himself off as an\nunmarried man for?""\n\n""I don\'t suppose he did, really,"" said Anne, trying to be just. ""He\nnever said he wasn\'t married. People simply took it for granted. Oh\nMarilla, what will Mrs. Lynde say to this?""\n\nThey found out what Mrs. Lynde had to say when she came up that evening.\nMrs. Lynde wasn\'t surprised! Mrs. Lynde had always expected something\nof the sort! Mrs. Lynde had always known there was SOMETHING about Mr.\nHarrison!\n\n""To think of his deserting his wife!"" she said indignantly. ""It\'s like\nsomething you\'d read of in the States, but who would expect such a thing\nto happen right here in Avonlea?""\n\n""But we don\'t know that he deserted her,"" protested Anne, determined to\nbelieve her friend innocent till he was proved guilty. ""We don\'t know\nthe rights of it at all.""\n\n""Well, we soon will. I\'m going straight over there,"" said Mrs. Lynde,\nwho had never learned that there was such a word as delicacy in the\ndictionary. ""I\'m not supposed to know anything about her arrival, and\nMr. Harrison was to bring some medicine for Thomas from Carmody today,\nso that will be a good excuse. I\'ll find out the whole story and come in\nand tell you on the way back.""\n\nMrs. Lynde rushed in where Anne had feared to tread. Nothing would have\ninduced the latter to go over to the Harrison place; but she had her\nnatural and proper share of curiosity and she felt secretly glad that\nMrs. Lynde was going to solve the mystery. She and Marilla waited\nexpectantly for that good lady\'s return, but waited in vain. Mrs. Lynde\ndid not revisit Green Gables that night. Davy, arriving home at nine\no\'clock from the Boulter place, explained why.\n\n""I met Mrs. Lynde and some strange woman in the Hollow,"" he said, ""and\ngracious, how they were talking both at once! Mrs. Lynde said to tell\nyou she was sorry it was too late to call tonight. Anne, I\'m awful\nhungry. We had tea at Milty\'s at four and I think Mrs. Boulter is real\nmean. She didn\'t give us any preserves or cake  . . . and even the bread\nwas skurce.""\n\n""Davy, when you go visiting you must never criticize anything you are\ngiven to eat,"" said Anne solemnly. ""It is very bad manners.""\n\n""All right . . . I\'ll only think it,"" said Davy cheerfully. ""Do give a\nfellow some supper, Anne.""\n\nAnne looked at Marilla, who followed her into the pantry and shut the\ndoor cautiously.\n\n""You can give him some jam on his bread, I know what tea at Levi\nBoulter\'s is apt to be.""\n\nDavy took his slice of bread and jam with a sigh.\n\n""It\'s a kind of disappointing world after all,"" he remarked. ""Milty has\na cat that takes fits . . . she\'s took a fit regular every day for three\nweeks. Milty says it\'s awful fun to watch her. I went down today on\npurpose to see her have one but the mean old thing wouldn\'t take a fit\nand just kept healthy as healthy, though Milty and me hung round all\nthe afternoon and waited. But never mind""  . . . Davy brightened up as the\ninsidious comfort of the plum jam stole into his soul . . . ""maybe I\'ll\nsee her in one sometime yet. It doesn\'t seem likely she\'d stop having\nthem all at once when she\'s been so in the habit of it, does it? This\njam is awful nice.""\n\nDavy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure.\n\nSunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad; but by Monday\neverybody had heard some version of the Harrison story. The school\nbuzzed with it and Davy came home, full of information.\n\n""Marilla, Mr. Harrison has a new wife . . . well, not ezackly new, but\nthey\'ve stopped being married for quite a spell, Milty says. I always\ns\'posed people had to keep on being married once they\'d begun, but Milty\nsays no, there\'s ways of stopping if you can\'t agree. Milty says one way\nis just to start off and leave your wife, and that\'s what Mr. Harrison\ndid. Milty says Mr. Harrison left his wife because she throwed things at\nhim . . . HARD things . . . and Arty Sloane says it was because she\nwouldn\'t let him smoke, and Ned Clay says it was \'cause she never let up\nscolding him. I wouldn\'t leave MY wife for anything like that. I\'d just\nput my foot down and say, \'Mrs. Davy, you\'ve just got to do what\'ll\nplease ME \'cause I\'m a MAN.\' THAT\'D settle her pretty quick I guess. But\nAnnetta Clay says SHE left HIM because he wouldn\'t scrape his boots at\nthe door and she doesn\'t blame her. I\'m going right over to Mr.\nHarrison\'s this minute to see what she\'s like.""\n\nDavy soon returned, somewhat cast down.\n\n""Mrs. Harrison was away . . . she\'s gone to Carmody with Mrs. Rachel Lynde\nto get new paper for the parlor. And Mr. Harrison said to tell Anne to\ngo over and see him \'cause he wants to have a talk with her. And say,\nthe floor is scrubbed, and Mr. Harrison is shaved, though there wasn\'t\nany preaching yesterday.""\n\nThe Harrison kitchen wore a very unfamiliar look to Anne. The floor was\nindeed scrubbed to a wonderful pitch of purity and so was every article\nof furniture in the room; the stove was polished until she could see her\nface in it; the walls were whitewashed and the window panes sparkled\nin the sunlight. By the table sat Mr. Harrison in his working clothes,\nwhich on Friday had been noted for sundry rents and tatters but which\nwere now neatly patched and brushed. He was sprucely shaved and what\nlittle hair he had was carefully trimmed.\n\n""Sit down, Anne, sit down,"" said Mr. Harrison in a tone but two degrees\nremoved from that which Avonlea people used at funerals. ""Emily\'s\ngone over to Carmody with Rachel Lynde . . . she\'s struck up a lifelong\nfriendship already with Rachel Lynde. Beats all how contrary women\nare. Well, Anne, my easy times are over . . . all over. It\'s neatness and\ntidiness for me for the rest of my natural life, I suppose.""\n\nMr. Harrison did his best to speak dolefully, but an irrepressible\ntwinkle in his eye betrayed him.\n\n""Mr. Harrison, you are glad your wife is come back,"" cried Anne, shaking\nher finger at him. ""You needn\'t pretend you\'re not, because I can see it\nplainly.""\n\nMr. Harrison relaxed into a sheepish smile.\n\n""Well . . . well . . . I\'m getting used to it,"" he conceded. ""I can\'t say\nI was sorry to see Emily. A man really needs some protection in a\ncommunity like this, where he can\'t play a game of checkers with a\nneighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbor\'s\nsister and having it put in the paper.""\n\n""Nobody would have supposed you went to see Isabella Andrews if you\nhadn\'t pretended to be unmarried,"" said Anne severely.\n\n""I didn\'t pretend I was. If anybody\'d have asked me if I was married I\'d\nhave said I was. But they just took it for granted. I wasn\'t anxious to\ntalk about the matter . . . I was feeling too sore over it. It would have\nbeen nuts for Mrs. Rachel Lynde if she had known my wife had left me,\nwouldn\'t it now?""\n\n""But some people say that you left her.""\n\n""She started it, Anne, she started it. I\'m going to tell you the whole\nstory, for I don\'t want you to think worse of me than I deserve . . . nor\nof Emily neither. But let\'s go out on the veranda. Everything is so\nfearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick. I suppose I\'ll\nget used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard.\nEmily hasn\'t had time to tidy it up yet.""\n\nAs soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda Mr. Harrison\nbegan his tale of woe.\n\n""I lived in Scottsford, New Brunswick, before I came here, Anne. My\nsister kept house for me and she suited me fine; she was just reasonably\ntidy and she let me alone and spoiled me . . . so Emily says. But three\nyears ago she died. Before she died she worried a lot about what was\nto become of me and finally she got me to promise I\'d get married. She\nadvised me to take Emily Scott because Emily had money of her own and\nwas a pattern housekeeper. I said, says I, \'Emily Scott wouldn\'t look at\nme.\' \'You ask her and see,\' says my sister; and just to ease her mind I\npromised her I would . . . and I did. And Emily said she\'d have me. Never\nwas so surprised in my life, Anne . . . a smart pretty little woman like\nher and an old fellow like me. I tell you I thought at first I was in\nluck. Well, we were married and took a little wedding trip to St. John\nfor a fortnight and then we went home. We got home at ten o\'clock at\nnight, and I give you my word, Anne, that in half an hour that woman was\nat work housecleaning. Oh, I know you\'re thinking my house needed it . . .\nyou\'ve got a very expressive face, Anne; your thoughts just come out\non it like print . . . but it didn\'t, not that bad. It had got pretty\nmixed up while I was keeping bachelor\'s hall, I admit, but I\'d got a\nwoman to come in and clean it up before I was married and there\'d been\nconsiderable painting and fixing done. I tell you if you took Emily into\na brand new white marble palace she\'d be into the scrubbing as soon as\nshe could get an old dress on. Well, she cleaned house till one o\'clock\nthat night and at four she was up and at it again. And she kept on that\nway . . . far\'s I could see she never stopped. It was scour and sweep and\ndust everlasting, except on Sundays, and then she was just longing for\nMonday to begin again. But it was her way of amusing herself and I\ncould have reconciled myself to it if she\'d left me alone. But that\nshe wouldn\'t do. She\'d set out to make me over but she hadn\'t caught me\nyoung enough. I wasn\'t allowed to come into the house unless I changed\nmy boots for slippers at the door. I darsn\'t smoke a pipe for my life\nunless I went to the barn. And I didn\'t use good enough grammar. Emily\'d\nbeen a schoolteacher in her early life and she\'d never got over it. Then\nshe hated to see me eating with my knife. Well, there it was, pick and\nnag everlasting. But I s\'pose, Anne, to be fair, _I_ was cantankerous\ntoo. I didn\'t try to improve as I might have done . . . I just got cranky\nand disagreeable when she found fault. I told her one day she hadn\'t\ncomplained of my grammar when I proposed to her. It wasn\'t an overly\ntactful thing to say. A woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner\nthan for hinting she was too much pleased to get him. Well, we bickered\nalong like that and it wasn\'t exactly pleasant, but we might have got\nused to each other after a spell if it hadn\'t been for Ginger. Ginger\nwas the rock we split on at last. Emily didn\'t like parrots and she\ncouldn\'t stand Ginger\'s profane habits of speech. I was attached to the\nbird for my brother the sailor\'s sake. My brother the sailor was a pet\nof mine when we were little tads and he\'d sent Ginger to me when he was\ndying. I didn\'t see any sense in getting worked up over his swearing.\nThere\'s nothing I hate worse\'n profanity in a human being, but in a\nparrot, that\'s just repeating what it\'s heard with no more understanding\nof it than I\'d have of Chinese, allowances might be made. But Emily\ncouldn\'t see it that way. Women ain\'t logical. She tried to break Ginger\nof swearing but she hadn\'t any better success than she had in trying to\nmake me stop saying \'I seen\' and \'them things.\' Seemed as if the more\nshe tried the worse Ginger got, same as me.\n\n""Well, things went on like this, both of us getting raspier, till the\nCLIMAX came. Emily invited our minister and his wife to tea, and another\nminister and HIS wife that was visiting them. I\'d promised to put Ginger\naway in some safe place where nobody would hear him . . . Emily wouldn\'t\ntouch his cage with a ten-foot pole  . . .  and I meant to do it, for I\ndidn\'t want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house. But\nit slipped my mind . . . Emily was worrying me so much about clean collars\nand grammar that it wasn\'t any wonder . . . and I never thought of that\npoor parrot till we sat down to tea. Just as minister number one was in\nthe very middle of saying grace, Ginger, who was on the veranda outside\nthe dining room window, lifted up HIS voice. The gobbler had come into\nview in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome\neffect on Ginger. He surpassed himself that time. You can smile, Anne,\nand I don\'t deny I\'ve chuckled some over it since myself, but at the\ntime I felt almost as much mortified as Emily. I went out and carried\nGinger to the barn. I can\'t say I enjoyed the meal. I knew by the look\nof Emily that there was trouble brewing for Ginger and James A. When the\nfolks went away I started for the cow pasture and on the way I did some\nthinking. I felt sorry for Emily and kind of fancied I hadn\'t been so\nthoughtful of her as I might; and besides, I wondered if the ministers\nwould think that Ginger had learned his vocabulary from me. The long\nand short of it was, I decided that Ginger would have to be mercifully\ndisposed of and when I\'d druv the cows home I went in to tell Emily\nso. But there was no Emily and there was a letter on the table . . . just\naccording to the rule in story books. Emily writ that I\'d have to choose\nbetween her and Ginger; she\'d gone back to her own house and there she\nwould stay till I went and told her I\'d got rid of that parrot.\n\n""I was all riled up, Anne, and I said she might stay till doomsday if\nshe waited for that; and I stuck to it. I packed up her belongings and\nsent them after her. It made an awful lot of talk  . . . Scottsford was\npretty near as bad as Avonlea for gossip . . . and everybody sympathized\nwith Emily. It kept me all cross and cantankerous and I saw I\'d have to\nget out or I\'d never have any peace. I concluded I\'d come to the Island.\nI\'d been here when I was a boy and I liked it; but Emily had always said\nshe wouldn\'t live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after\ndark for fear they\'d fall off the edge. So, just to be contrary, I moved\nover here. And that\'s all there is to it. I hadn\'t ever heard a word\nfrom or about Emily till I come home from the back field Saturday and\nfound her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner I\'d had\nsince she left me all ready on the table. She told me to eat it first\nand then we\'d talk . . . by which I concluded that Emily had learned some\nlessons about getting along with a man. So she\'s here and she\'s going to\nstay . . . seeing that Ginger\'s dead and the Island\'s some bigger than she\nthought. There\'s Mrs. Lynde and her now. No, don\'t go, Anne. Stay and\nget acquainted with Emily. She took quite a notion to you Saturday . . .\nwanted to know who that handsome redhaired girl was at the next house.""\n\nMrs. Harrison welcomed Anne radiantly and insisted on her staying to\ntea.\n\n""James A. has been telling me all about you and how kind you\'ve been,\nmaking cakes and things for him,"" she said. ""I want to get acquainted\nwith all my new neighbors just as soon as possible. Mrs. Lynde is a\nlovely woman, isn\'t she? So friendly.""\n\nWhen Anne went home in the sweet June dusk, Mrs. Harrison went with her\nacross the fields where the fireflies were lighting their starry lamps.\n\n""I suppose,"" said Mrs. Harrison confidentially, ""that James A. has told\nyou our story?""\n\n""Yes.""\n\n""Then I needn\'t tell it, for James A. is a just man and he would tell\nthe truth. The blame was far from being all on his side. I can see that\nnow. I wasn\'t back in my own house an hour before I wished I hadn\'t been\nso hasty but I wouldn\'t give in. I see now that I expected too much of\na man. And I was real foolish to mind his bad grammar. It doesn\'t matter\nif a man does use bad grammar so long as he is a good provider and\ndoesn\'t go poking round the pantry to see how much sugar you\'ve used\nin a week. I feel that James A. and I are going to be real happy now.\nI wish I knew who \'Observer\' is, so that I could thank him. I owe him a\nreal debt of gratitude.""\n\nAnne kept her own counsel and Mrs. Harrison never knew that her\ngratitude found its way to its object. Anne felt rather bewildered\nover the far-reaching consequences of those foolish ""notes."" They had\nreconciled a man to his wife and made the reputation of a prophet.\n\nMrs. Lynde was in the Green Gables kitchen. She had been telling the\nwhole story to Marilla.\n\n""Well, and how do you like Mrs. Harrison?"" she asked Anne.\n\n""Very much. I think she\'s a real nice little woman.""\n\n""That\'s exactly what she is,"" said Mrs. Rachel with emphasis, ""and as\nI\'ve just been sayin\' to Marilla, I think we ought all to overlook Mr.\nHarrison\'s peculiarities for her sake and try to make her feel at home\nhere, that\'s what. Well, I must get back. Thomas\'ll be wearying for me.\nI get out a little since Eliza came and he\'s seemed a lot better these\npast few days, but I never like to be long away from him. I hear Gilbert\nBlythe has resigned from White Sands. He\'ll be off to college in the\nfall, I suppose.""\n\nMrs. Rachel looked sharply at Anne, but Anne was bending over a sleepy\nDavy nodding on the sofa and nothing was to be read in her face. She\ncarried Davy away, her oval girlish cheek pressed against his curly\nyellow head. As they went up the stairs Davy flung a tired arm about\nAnne\'s neck and gave her a warm hug and a sticky kiss.\n\n""You\'re awful nice, Anne. Milty Boulter wrote on his slate today and\nshowed it to Jennie Sloane,\n\n     ""\'Roses red and vi\'lets blue,\n     Sugar\'s sweet, and so are you""\n\nand that \'spresses my feelings for you ezackly, Anne.""\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nAround the Bend\n\n\nThomas Lynde faded out of life as quietly and unobtrusively as he had\nlived it. His wife was a tender, patient, unwearied nurse. Sometimes\nRachel had been a little hard on her Thomas in health, when his slowness\nor meekness had provoked her; but when he became ill no voice could be\nlower, no hand more gently skillful, no vigil more uncomplaining.\n\n""You\'ve been a good wife to me, Rachel,"" he once said simply, when she\nwas sitting by him in the dusk, holding his thin, blanched old hand\nin her work-hardened one. ""A good wife. I\'m sorry I ain\'t leaving you\nbetter off; but the children will look after you. They\'re all smart,\ncapable children, just like their mother. A good mother . . . a good\nwoman . . .  .""\n\nHe had fallen asleep then, and the next morning, just as the white dawn\nwas creeping up over the pointed firs in the hollow, Marilla went softly\ninto the east gable and wakened Anne.\n\n""Anne, Thomas Lynde is gone . . . their hired boy just brought the word.\nI\'m going right down to Rachel.""\n\nOn the day after Thomas Lynde\'s funeral Marilla went about Green Gables\nwith a strangely preoccupied air. Occasionally she looked at Anne,\nseemed on the point of saying something, then shook her head and\nbuttoned up her mouth. After tea she went down to see Mrs. Rachel; and\nwhen she returned she went to the east gable, where Anne was correcting\nschool exercises.\n\n""How is Mrs. Lynde tonight?"" asked the latter.\n\n""She\'s feeling calmer and more composed,"" answered Marilla, sitting\ndown on Anne\'s bed . . . a proceeding which betokened some unusual mental\nexcitement, for in Marilla\'s code of household ethics to sit on a\nbed after it was made up was an unpardonable offense. ""But she\'s very\nlonely. Eliza had to go home today . . . her son isn\'t well and she felt\nshe couldn\'t stay any longer.""\n\n""When I\'ve finished these exercises I\'ll run down and chat awhile with\nMrs. Lynde,"" said Anne. ""I had intended to study some Latin composition\ntonight but it can wait.""\n\n""I suppose Gilbert Blythe is going to college in the fall,"" said Marilla\njerkily. ""How would you like to go too, Anne?""\n\nAnne looked up in astonishment.\n\n""I would like it, of course, Marilla. But it isn\'t possible.""\n\n""I guess it can be made possible. I\'ve always felt that you should go.\nI\'ve never felt easy to think you were giving it all up on my account.""\n\n""But Marilla, I\'ve never been sorry for a moment that I stayed\nhome. I\'ve been so happy . . . Oh, these past two years have just been\ndelightful.""\n\n""Oh, yes, I know you\'ve been contented enough. But that isn\'t the\nquestion exactly. You ought to go on with your education. You\'ve saved\nenough to put you through one year at Redmond and the money the stock\nbrought in will do for another year . . . and there\'s scholarships and\nthings you might win.""\n\n""Yes, but I can\'t go, Marilla. Your eyes are better, of course; but I\ncan\'t leave you alone with the twins. They need so much looking after.""\n\n""I won\'t be alone with them. That\'s what I meant to discuss with you.\nI had a long talk with Rachel tonight. Anne, she\'s feeling dreadful bad\nover a good many things. She\'s not left very well off. It seems they\nmortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the youngest boy a start\nwhen he went west; and they\'ve never been able to pay much more than the\ninterest since. And then of course Thomas\' illness has cost a good deal,\none way or another. The farm will have to be sold and Rachel thinks\nthere\'ll be hardly anything left after the bills are settled. She says\nshe\'ll have to go and live with Eliza and it\'s breaking her heart to\nthink of leaving Avonlea. A woman of her age doesn\'t make new friends\nand interests easy. And, Anne, as she talked about it the thought came\nto me that I would ask her to come and live with me, but I thought I\nought to talk it over with you first before I said anything to her. If I\nhad Rachel living with me you could go to college. How do you feel about\nit?""\n\n""I feel . . . as if . . . somebody . . . had handed me . . . the moon\n. . . and I didn\'t know . . . exactly . . . what to do . . . with it,""\nsaid Anne dazedly. ""But as for asking Mrs. Lynde to come here, that is\nfor you to decide, Marilla. Do you think . . . are you sure . . . you\nwould like it? Mrs. Lynde is a good woman and a kind neighbor, but . . .\nbut . . .""\n\n""But she\'s got her faults, you mean to say? Well, she has, of course;\nbut I think I\'d rather put up with far worse faults than see Rachel go\naway from Avonlea. I\'d miss her terrible. She\'s the only close friend\nI\'ve got here and I\'d be lost without her. We\'ve been neighbors for\nforty-five years and we\'ve never had a quarrel . . . though we came rather\nnear it that time you flew at Mrs. Rachel for calling you homely and\nredhaired. Do you remember, Anne?""\n\n""I should think I do,"" said Anne ruefully. ""People don\'t forget things\nlike that. How I hated poor Mrs. Rachel at that moment!""\n\n""And then that \'apology\' you made her. Well, you were a handful, in all\nconscience, Anne. I did feel so puzzled and bewildered how to manage\nyou. Matthew understood you better.""\n\n""Matthew understood everything,"" said Anne softly, as she always spoke\nof him.\n\n""Well, I think it could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldn\'t clash\nat all. It always seemed to me that the reason two women can\'t get along\nin one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each\nother\'s way. Now, if Rachel came here, she could have the north gable\nfor her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not, for we\ndon\'t really need a spare room at all. She could put her stove there\nand what furniture she wanted to keep, and be real comfortable and\nindependent. She\'ll have enough to live on of course...her children\'ll\nsee to that...so all I\'d be giving her would be house room. Yes, Anne,\nfar as I\'m concerned I\'d like it.""\n\n""Then ask her,"" said Anne promptly. ""I\'d be very sorry myself to see\nMrs. Rachel go away.""\n\n""And if she comes,"" continued Marilla, ""You can go to college as well as\nnot. She\'ll be company for me and she\'ll do for the twins what I can\'t\ndo, so there\'s no reason in the world why you shouldn\'t go.""\n\nAnne had a long meditation at her window that night. Joy and regret\nstruggled together in her heart. She had come at last . . . suddenly and\nunexpectedly . . . to the bend in the road; and college was around it,\nwith a hundred rainbow hopes and visions; but Anne realized as well that\nwhen she rounded that curve she must leave many sweet things behind. . .\nall the little simple duties and interests which had grown so dear to\nher in the last two years and which she had glorified into beauty and\ndelight by the enthusiasm she had put into them. She must give up her\nschool . . .  and she loved every one of her pupils, even the stupid and\nnaughty ones. The mere thought of Paul Irving made her wonder if Redmond\nwere such a name to conjure with after all.\n\n""I\'ve put out a lot of little roots these two years,"" Anne told the\nmoon, ""and when I\'m pulled up they\'re going to hurt a great deal. But\nit\'s best to go, I think, and, as Marilla says, there\'s no good reason\nwhy I shouldn\'t. I must get out all my ambitions and dust them.""\n\nAnne sent in her resignation the next day; and Mrs. Rachel, after a\nheart to heart talk with Marilla, gratefully accepted the offer of a\nhome at Green Gables. She elected to remain in her own house for the\nsummer, however; the farm was not to be sold until the fall and there\nwere many arrangements to be made.\n\n""I certainly never thought of living as far off the road as Green\nGables,"" sighed Mrs. Rachel to herself. ""But really, Green Gables\ndoesn\'t seem as out of the world as it used to do . . . Anne has lots of\ncompany and the twins make it real lively. And anyhow, I\'d rather live\nat the bottom of a well than leave Avonlea.""\n\nThese two decisions being noised abroad speedily ousted the arrival of\nMrs. Harrison in popular gossip. Sage heads were shaken over Marilla\nCuthbert\'s rash step in asking Mrs. Rachel to live with her. People\nopined that they wouldn\'t get on together. They were both ""too fond of\ntheir own way,"" and many doleful predictions were made, none of which\ndisturbed the parties in question at all. They had come to a clear and\ndistinct understanding of the respective duties and rights of their new\narrangements and meant to abide by them.\n\n""I won\'t meddle with you nor you with me,"" Mrs. Rachel had said\ndecidedly, ""and as for the twins, I\'ll be glad to do all I can for them;\nbut I won\'t undertake to answer Davy\'s questions, that\'s what. I\'m not\nan encyclopedia, neither am I a Philadelphia lawyer. You\'ll miss Anne\nfor that.""\n\n""Sometimes Anne\'s answers were about as queer as Davy\'s questions,"" said\nMarilla drily. ""The twins will miss her and no mistake; but her future\ncan\'t be sacrificed to Davy\'s thirst for information. When he asks\nquestions I can\'t answer I\'ll just tell him children should be seen and\nnot heard. That was how I was brought up, and I don\'t know but what it\nwas just as good a way as all these new-fangled notions for training\nchildren.""\n\n""Well, Anne\'s methods seem to have worked fairly well with Davy,"" said\nMrs. Lynde smilingly. ""He is a reformed character, that\'s what.""\n\n""He isn\'t a bad little soul,"" conceded Marilla. ""I never expected to\nget as fond of those children as I have. Davy gets round you somehow\n. . . and Dora is a lovely child, although she is . . . kind of . . .\nwell, kind of . . .""\n\n""Monotonous? Exactly,"" supplied Mrs. Rachel. ""Like a book where every\npage is the same, that\'s what. Dora will make a good, reliable woman\nbut she\'ll never set the pond on fire. Well, that sort of folks are\ncomfortable to have round, even if they\'re not as interesting as the\nother kind.""\n\nGilbert Blythe was probably the only person to whom the news of Anne\'s\nresignation brought unmixed pleasure. Her pupils looked upon it as\na sheer catastrophe. Annetta Bell had hysterics when she went home.\nAnthony Pye fought two pitched and unprovoked battles with other boys by\nway of relieving his feelings. Barbara Shaw cried all night. Paul Irving\ndefiantly told his grandmother that she needn\'t expect him to eat any\nporridge for a week.\n\n""I can\'t do it, Grandma,"" he said. ""I don\'t really know if I can eat\nANYTHING. I feel as if there was a dreadful lump in my throat. I\'d have\ncried coming home from school if Jake Donnell hadn\'t been watching me.\nI believe I will cry after I go to bed. It wouldn\'t show on my eyes\ntomorrow, would it? And it would be such a relief. But anyway, I can\'t\neat porridge. I\'m going to need all my strength of mind to bear up\nagainst this, Grandma, and I won\'t have any left to grapple with\nporridge. Oh Grandma, I don\'t know what I\'ll do when my beautiful\nteacher goes away. Milty Boulter says he bets Jane Andrews will get\nthe school. I suppose Miss Andrews is very nice. But I know she won\'t\nunderstand things like Miss Shirley.""\n\nDiana also took a very pessimistic view of affairs.\n\n""It will be horribly lonesome here next winter,"" she mourned, one\ntwilight when the moonlight was raining ""airy silver"" through the cherry\nboughs and filling the east gable with a soft, dream-like radiance\nin which the two girls sat and talked, Anne on her low rocker by the\nwindow, Diana sitting Turkfashion on the bed. ""You and Gilbert will\nbe gone  . . . and the Allans too. They are going to call Mr. Allan to\nCharlottetown and of course he\'ll accept. It\'s too mean. We\'ll be\nvacant all winter, I suppose, and have to listen to a long string of\ncandidates . . . and half of them won\'t be any good.""\n\n""I hope they won\'t call Mr. Baxter from East Grafton here, anyhow,""\nsaid Anne decidedly. ""He wants the call but he does preach such gloomy\nsermons. Mr. Bell says he\'s a minister of the old school, but Mrs. Lynde\nsays there\'s nothing whatever the matter with him but indigestion. His\nwife isn\'t a very good cook, it seems, and Mrs. Lynde says that when a\nman has to eat sour bread two weeks out of three his theology is bound\nto get a kink in it somewhere. Mrs. Allan feels very badly about going\naway. She says everybody has been so kind to her since she came here\nas a bride that she feels as if she were leaving lifelong friends. And\nthen, there\'s the baby\'s grave, you know. She says she doesn\'t see how\nshe can go away and leave that . . . it was such a little mite of a thing\nand only three months old, and she says she is afraid it will miss its\nmother, although she knows better and wouldn\'t say so to Mr. Allan for\nanything. She says she has slipped through the birch grove back of the\nmanse nearly every night to the graveyard and sung a little lullaby to\nit. She told me all about it last evening when I was up putting some of\nthose early wild roses on Matthew\'s grave. I promised her that as long\nas I was in Avonlea I would put flowers on the baby\'s grave and when I\nwas away I felt sure that . . .""\n\n""That I would do it,"" supplied Diana heartily. ""Of course I will. And\nI\'ll put them on Matthew\'s grave too, for your sake, Anne.""\n\n""Oh, thank you. I meant to ask you to if you would. And on little Hester\nGray\'s too? Please don\'t forget hers. Do you know, I\'ve thought and\ndreamed so much about little Hester Gray that she has become strangely\nreal to me. I think of her, back there in her little garden in that\ncool, still, green corner; and I have a fancy that if I could steal back\nthere some spring evening, just at the magic time \'twixt light and\ndark, and tiptoe so softly up the beech hill that my footsteps could not\nfrighten her, I would find the garden just as it used to be, all sweet\nwith June lilies and early roses, with the tiny house beyond it all hung\nwith vines; and little Hester Gray would be there, with her soft eyes,\nand the wind ruffling her dark hair, wandering about, putting her\nfingertips under the chins of the lilies and whispering secrets with the\nroses; and I would go forward, oh, so softly, and hold out my hands and\nsay to her, \'Little Hester Gray, won\'t you let me be your playmate, for\nI love the roses too?\' And we would sit down on the old bench and talk\na little and dream a little, or just be beautifully silent together. And\nthen the moon would rise and I would look around me  . . . and there would\nbe no Hester Gray and no little vine-hung house, and no roses . . . only\nan old waste garden starred with June lilies amid the grasses, and the\nwind sighing, oh, so sorrowfully in the cherry trees. And I would not\nknow whether it had been real or if I had just imagined it all."" Diana\ncrawled up and got her back against the headboard of the bed. When your\ncompanion of twilight hour said such spooky things it was just as well\nnot to be able to fancy there was anything behind you.\n\n""I\'m afraid the Improvement Society will go down when you and Gilbert\nare both gone,"" she remarked dolefully.\n\n""Not a bit of fear of it,"" said Anne briskly, coming back from dreamland\nto the affairs of practical life. ""It is too firmly established for\nthat, especially since the older people are becoming so enthusiastic\nabout it. Look what they are doing this summer for their lawns and\nlanes. Besides, I\'ll be watching for hints at Redmond and I\'ll write a\npaper for it next winter and send it over. Don\'t take such a gloomy view\nof things, Diana. And don\'t grudge me my little hour of gladness and\njubilation now. Later on, when I have to go away, I\'ll feel anything but\nglad.""\n\n""It\'s all right for you to be glad . . . you\'re going to college and\nyou\'ll have a jolly time and make heaps of lovely new friends.""\n\n""I hope I shall make new friends,"" said Anne thoughtfully. ""The\npossibilities of making new friends help to make life very fascinating.\nBut no matter how many friends I make they\'ll never be as dear to me as\nthe old ones . . . especially a certain girl with black eyes and dimples.\nCan you guess who she is, Diana?""\n\n""But there\'ll be so many clever girls at Redmond,"" sighed Diana, ""and\nI\'m only a stupid little country girl who says \'I seen\' sometimes. . .\nthough I really know better when I stop to think. Well, of course these\npast two years have really been too pleasant to last. I know SOMEBODY\nwho is glad you are going to Redmond anyhow. Anne, I\'m going to ask\nyou a question . . . a serious question. Don\'t be vexed and do answer\nseriously. Do you care anything for Gilbert?""\n\n""Ever so much as a friend and not a bit in the way you mean,"" said Anne\ncalmly and decidedly; she also thought she was speaking sincerely.\n\nDiana sighed. She wished, somehow, that Anne had answered differently.\n\n""Don\'t you mean EVER to be married, Anne?""\n\n""Perhaps . . . some day . . . when I meet the right one,"" said Anne,\nsmiling dreamily up at the moonlight.\n\n""But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one?"" persisted\nDiana.\n\n""Oh, I should know him . . . SOMETHING would tell me. You know what my\nideal is, Diana.""\n\n""But people\'s ideals change sometimes.""\n\n""Mine won\'t. And I COULDN\'T care for any man who didn\'t fulfill it.""\n\n""What if you never meet him?""\n\n""Then I shall die an old maid,"" was the cheerful response. ""I daresay it\nisn\'t the hardest death by any means.""\n\n""Oh, I suppose the dying would be easy enough; it\'s the living an old\nmaid I shouldn\'t like,"" said Diana, with no intention of being humorous.\n""Although I wouldn\'t mind being an old maid VERY much if I could be one\nlike Miss Lavendar. But I never could be. When I\'m forty-five I\'ll be\nhorribly fat. And while there might be some romance about a thin old\nmaid there couldn\'t possibly be any about a fat one. Oh, mind you,\nNelson Atkins proposed to Ruby Gillis three weeks ago. Ruby told me all\nabout it. She says she never had any intention of taking him, because\nany one who married him will have to go in with the old folks; but Ruby\nsays that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that\nit simply swept her off her feet. But she didn\'t want to do anything\nrash so she asked for a week to consider; and two days later she was\nat a meeting of the Sewing Circle at his mother\'s and there was a book\ncalled \'The Complete Guide to Etiquette,\' lying on the parlor table.\nRuby said she simply couldn\'t describe her feelings when in a section\nof it headed, \'The Deportment of Courtship and Marriage,\' she found the\nvery proposal Nelson had made, word for word. She went home and wrote\nhim a perfectly scathing refusal; and she says his father and mother\nhave taken turns watching him ever since for fear he\'ll drown himself in\nthe river; but Ruby says they needn\'t be afraid; for in the Deportment\nof Courtship and Marriage it told how a rejected lover should behave\nand there\'s nothing about drowning in THAT. And she says Wilbur Blair\nis literally pining away for her but she\'s perfectly helpless in the\nmatter.""\n\nAnne made an impatient movement.\n\n""I hate to say it . . . it seems so disloyal . . . but, well, I don\'t\nlike Ruby Gillis now. I liked her when we went to school and Queen\'s\ntogether . . . though not so well as you and Jane of course. But this last\nyear at Carmody she seems so different . . . so . . . so . . .""\n\n""I know,"" nodded Diana. ""It\'s the Gillis coming out in her . . .  she\ncan\'t help it. Mrs. Lynde says that if ever a Gillis girl thought about\nanything but the boys she never showed it in her walk and conversation.\nShe talks about nothing but boys and what compliments they pay her, and\nhow crazy they all are about her at Carmody. And the strange thing is,\nthey ARE, too . . ."" Diana admitted this somewhat resentfully. ""Last\nnight when I saw her in Mr. Blair\'s store she whispered to me that she\'d\njust made a new \'mash.\' I wouldn\'t ask her who it was, because I\nknew she was dying to BE asked. Well, it\'s what Ruby always wanted, I\nsuppose. You remember even when she was little she always said she meant\nto have dozens of beaus when she grew up and have the very gayest time\nshe could before she settled down. She\'s so different from Jane, isn\'t\nshe? Jane is such a nice, sensible, lady-like girl.""\n\n""Dear old Jane is a jewel,"" agreed Anne, ""but,"" she added, leaning\nforward to bestow a tender pat on the plump, dimpled little hand hanging\nover her pillow, ""there\'s nobody like my own Diana after all. Do\nyou remember that evening we first met, Diana, and \'swore\' eternal\nfriendship in your garden? We\'ve kept that \'oath,\' I think . . . we\'ve\nnever had a quarrel nor even a coolness. I shall never forget the thrill\nthat went over me the day you told me you loved me. I had had such a\nlonely, starved heart all through my childhood. I\'m just beginning to\nrealize how starved and lonely it really was. Nobody cared anything for\nme or wanted to be bothered with me. I should have been miserable if\nit hadn\'t been for that strange little dream-life of mine, wherein I\nimagined all the friends and love I craved. But when I came to Green\nGables everything was changed. And then I met you. You don\'t know what\nyour friendship meant to me. I want to thank you here and now, dear, for\nthe warm and true affection you\'ve always given me.""\n\n""And always, always will,"" sobbed Diana. ""I shall NEVER love anybody\n. . . any GIRL . . . half as well as I love you. And if I ever do marry\nand have a little girl of my own I\'m going to name her ANNE.""\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nAn Afternoon at the Stone House\n\n\n""Where are you going, all dressed up, Anne?"" Davy wanted to know. ""You\nlook bully in that dress.""\n\nAnne had come down to dinner in a new dress of pale green muslin . . .\nthe first color she had worn since Matthew\'s death. It became her\nperfectly, bringing out all the delicate, flower-like tints of her face\nand the gloss and burnish of her hair.\n\n""Davy, how many times have I told you that you mustn\'t use that word,""\nshe rebuked. ""I\'m going to Echo Lodge.""\n\n""Take me with you,"" entreated Davy.\n\n""I would if I were driving. But I\'m going to walk and it\'s too far for\nyour eight-year-old legs. Besides, Paul is going with me and I fear you\ndon\'t enjoy yourself in his company.""\n\n""Oh, I like Paul lots better\'n I did,"" said Davy, beginning to make\nfearful inroads into his pudding. ""Since I\'ve got pretty good myself I\ndon\'t mind his being gooder so much. If I can keep on I\'ll catch up with\nhim some day, both in legs and goodness. \'Sides, Paul\'s real nice to\nus second primer boys in school. He won\'t let the other big boys meddle\nwith us and he shows us lots of games.""\n\n""How came Paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday?"" asked\nAnne. ""I met him on the playground, such a dripping figure that I sent\nhim promptly home for clothes without waiting to find out what had\nhappened.""\n\n""Well, it was partly a zacksident,"" explained Davy. ""He stuck his head\nin on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally. We was all\ndown at the brook and Prillie Rogerson got mad at Paul about something\n. . . she\'s awful mean and horrid anyway, if she IS pretty . . . and said\nthat his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night. Paul\nwouldn\'t have minded what she said, I guess, but Gracie Andrews laughed,\nand Paul got awful red, \'cause Gracie\'s his girl, you know. He\'s CLEAN\nGONE on her . . . brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the\nshore road. He got as red as a beet and said his grandmother didn\'t do\nany such thing and his hair was born curly. And then he laid down on\nthe bank and stuck his head right into the spring to show them. Oh,\nit wasn\'t the spring we drink out of . . ."" seeing a horrified look on\nMarilla\'s face . . . ""it was the little one lower down. But the bank\'s\nawful slippy and Paul went right in. I tell you he made a bully splash.\nOh, Anne, Anne, I didn\'t mean to say that . . . it just slipped out before\nI thought. He made a SPLENDID splash. But he looked so funny when he\ncrawled out, all wet and muddy. The girls laughed more\'n ever, but\nGracie didn\'t laugh. She looked sorry. Gracie\'s a nice girl but she\'s\ngot a snub nose. When I get big enough to have a girl I won\'t have one\nwith a snub nose . . . I\'ll pick one with a pretty nose like yours, Anne.""\n\n""A boy who makes such a mess of syrup all over his face when he is\neating his pudding will never get a girl to look at him,"" said Marilla\nseverely.\n\n""But I\'ll wash my face before I go courting,"" protested Davy, trying to\nimprove matters by rubbing the back of his hand over the smears. ""And\nI\'ll wash behind my ears too, without being told. I remembered to this\nmorning, Marilla. I don\'t forget half as often as I did. But . . ."" and\nDavy sighed . . . ""there\'s so many corners about a fellow that it\'s awful\nhard to remember them all. Well, if I can\'t go to Miss Lavendar\'s I\'ll\ngo over and see Mrs. Harrison. Mrs. Harrison\'s an awful nice woman, I\ntell you. She keeps a jar of cookies in her pantry a-purpose for little\nboys, and she always gives me the scrapings out of a pan she\'s mixed\nup a plum cake in. A good many plums stick to the sides, you see. Mr.\nHarrison was always a nice man, but he\'s twice as nice since he got\nmarried over again. I guess getting married makes folks nicer. Why don\'t\nYOU get married, Marilla? I want to know.""\n\nMarilla\'s state of single blessedness had never been a sore point with\nher, so she answered amiably, with an exchange of significant looks with\nAnne, that she supposed it was because nobody would have her.\n\n""But maybe you never asked anybody to have you,"" protested Davy.\n\n""Oh, Davy,"" said Dora primly, shocked into speaking without being spoken\nto, ""it\'s the MEN that have to do the asking.""\n\n""I don\'t know why they have to do it ALWAYS,"" grumbled Davy. ""Seems\nto me everything\'s put on the men in this world. Can I have some more\npudding, Marilla?""\n\n""You\'ve had as much as was good for you,"" said Marilla; but she gave him\na moderate second helping.\n\n""I wish people could live on pudding. Why can\'t they, Marilla? I want to\nknow.""\n\n""Because they\'d soon get tired of it.""\n\n""I\'d like to try that for myself,"" said skeptical Davy. ""But I guess\nit\'s better to have pudding only on fish and company days than none at\nall. They never have any at Milty Boulter\'s. Milty says when company\ncomes his mother gives them cheese and cuts it herself . . . one little\nbit apiece and one over for manners.""\n\n""If Milty Boulter talks like that about his mother at least you needn\'t\nrepeat it,"" said Marilla severely.\n\n""Bless my soul,"" . . . Davy had picked this expression up from Mr.\nHarrison and used it with great gusto . . . ""Milty meant it as a\ncompelment. He\'s awful proud of his mother, cause folks say she could\nscratch a living on a rock.""\n\n""I . . . I suppose them pesky hens are in my pansy bed again,"" said\nMarilla, rising and going out hurriedly.\n\nThe slandered hens were nowhere near the pansy bed and Marilla did not\neven glance at it. Instead, she sat down on the cellar hatch and laughed\nuntil she was ashamed of herself.\n\nWhen Anne and Paul reached the stone house that afternoon they found\nMiss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth in the garden, weeding, raking,\nclipping, and trimming as if for dear life. Miss Lavendar herself, all\ngay and sweet in the frills and laces she loved, dropped her shears\nand ran joyously to meet her guests, while Charlotta the Fourth grinned\ncheerfully.\n\n""Welcome, Anne. I thought you\'d come today. You belong to the afternoon\nso it brought you. Things that belong together are sure to come\ntogether. What a lot of trouble that would save some people if they only\nknew it. But they don\'t . . . and so they waste beautiful energy moving\nheaven and earth to bring things together that DON\'T belong. And you,\nPaul . . . why, you\'ve grown! You\'re half a head taller than when you were\nhere before.""\n\n""Yes, I\'ve begun to grow like pigweed in the night, as Mrs. Lynde\nsays,"" said Paul, in frank delight over the fact. ""Grandma says it\'s the\nporridge taking effect at last. Perhaps it is. Goodness knows . . ."" Paul\nsighed deeply . . . ""I\'ve eaten enough to make anyone grow. I do hope,\nnow that I\'ve begun, I\'ll keep on till I\'m as tall as father. He is six\nfeet, you know, Miss Lavendar.""\n\nYes, Miss Lavendar did know; the flush on her pretty cheeks deepened\na little; she took Paul\'s hand on one side and Anne\'s on the other and\nwalked to the house in silence.\n\n""Is it a good day for the echoes, Miss Lavendar?"" queried Paul\nanxiously. The day of his first visit had been too windy for echoes and\nPaul had been much disappointed.\n\n""Yes, just the best kind of a day,"" answered Miss Lavendar, rousing\nherself from her reverie. ""But first we are all going to have something\nto eat. I know you two folks didn\'t walk all the way back here through\nthose beechwoods without getting hungry, and Charlotta the Fourth and\nI can eat any hour of the day . . . we have such obliging appetites. So\nwe\'ll just make a raid on the pantry. Fortunately it\'s lovely and\nfull. I had a presentiment that I was going to have company today and\nCharlotta the Fourth and I prepared.""\n\n""I think you are one of the people who always have nice things in\ntheir pantry,"" declared Paul. ""Grandma\'s like that too. But she doesn\'t\napprove of snacks between meals. I wonder,"" he added meditatively, ""if I\nOUGHT to eat them away from home when I know she doesn\'t approve.""\n\n""Oh, I don\'t think she would disapprove after you have had a long walk.\nThat makes a difference,"" said Miss Lavendar, exchanging amused glances\nwith Anne over Paul\'s brown curls. ""I suppose that snacks ARE extremely\nunwholesome. That is why we have them so often at Echo Lodge. We. . .\nCharlotta the Fourth and I . . . live in defiance of every known law\nof diet. We eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to\nthink of it, by day or night; and we flourish like green bay trees.\nWe are always intending to reform. When we read any article in a paper\nwarning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the\nkitchen wall so that we\'ll remember it. But we never can somehow . . .\nuntil after we\'ve gone and eaten that very thing. Nothing has ever\nkilled us yet; but Charlotta the Fourth has been known to have bad\ndreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before\nwe went to bed.""\n\n""Grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter\nbefore I go to bed; and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread,""\nsaid Paul. ""So I\'m always glad when it\'s Sunday night . . .  for more\nreasons than one. Sunday is a very long day on the shore road. Grandma\nsays it\'s all too short for her and that father never found Sundays\ntiresome when he was a little boy. It wouldn\'t seem so long if I could\ntalk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn\'t\napprove of it on Sundays. I think a good deal; but I\'m afraid my\nthoughts are worldly. Grandma says we should never think anything but\nreligious thoughts on Sundays. But teacher here said once that every\nreally beautiful thought was religious, no matter what it was about, or\nwhat day we thought it on. But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons\nand Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly\nreligious thoughts about. And when it comes to a difference of opinion\nbetween Grandma and teacher I don\'t know what to do. In my heart"" . . .\nPaul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to\nMiss Lavendar\'s immediately sympathetic face . . . ""I agree with teacher.\nBut then, you see, Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a\nbrilliant success of him; and teacher has never brought anybody up yet,\nthough she\'s helping with Davy and Dora. But you can\'t tell how they\'ll\nturn out till they ARE grown up. So sometimes I feel as if it might be\nsafer to go by Grandma\'s opinions.""\n\n""I think it would,"" agreed Anne solemnly. ""Anyway, I daresay that if\nyour Grandma and I both got down to what we really do mean, under our\ndifferent ways of expressing it, we\'d find out we both meant much the\nsame thing. You\'d better go by her way of expressing it, since it\'s been\nthe result of experience. We\'ll have to wait until we see how the twins\ndo turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good."" After\nlunch they went back to the garden, where Paul made the acquaintance of\nthe echoes, to his wonder and delight, while Anne and Miss Lavendar sat\non the stone bench under the poplar and talked.\n\n""So you are going away in the fall?"" said Miss Lavendar wistfully. ""I\nought to be glad for your sake, Anne . . . but I\'m horribly, selfishly\nsorry. I shall miss you so much. Oh, sometimes, I think it is of no use\nto make friends. They only go out of your life after awhile and leave a\nhurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came.""\n\n""That sounds like something Miss Eliza Andrews might say but never Miss\nLavendar,"" said Anne. ""NOTHING is worse than emptiness . . . and I\'m not\ngoing out of your life. There are such things as letters and vacations.\nDearest, I\'m afraid you\'re looking a little pale and tired.""\n\n""Oh . . . hoo . . . hoo . . . hoo,"" went Paul on the dyke, where he had\nbeen making noises diligently . . . not all of them melodious in the\nmaking, but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of\nsound by the fairy alchemists over the river. Miss Lavendar made an\nimpatient movement with her pretty hands.\n\n""I\'m just tired of everything . . . even of the echoes. There is nothing\nin my life but echoes . . . echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys.\nThey\'re beautiful and mocking. Oh Anne, it\'s horrid of me to talk like\nthis when I have company. It\'s just that I\'m getting old and it doesn\'t\nagree with me. I know I\'ll be fearfully cranky by the time I\'m sixty.\nBut perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills."" At this moment\nCharlotta the Fourth, who had disappeared after lunch, returned, and\nannounced that the northeast corner of Mr. John Kimball\'s pasture was\nred with early strawberries, and wouldn\'t Miss Shirley like to go and\npick some.\n\n""Early strawberries for tea!"" exclaimed Miss Lavendar. ""Oh, I\'m not so\nold as I thought . . . and I don\'t need a single blue pill! Girls, when\nyou come back with your strawberries we\'ll have tea out here under the\nsilver poplar. I\'ll have it all ready for you with home-grown cream.""\n\nAnne and Charlotta the Fourth accordingly betook themselves back to Mr.\nKimball\'s pasture, a green remote place where the air was as soft as\nvelvet and fragrant as a bed of violets and golden as amber.\n\n""Oh, isn\'t it sweet and fresh back here?"" breathed Anne. ""I just feel as\nif I were drinking in the sunshine.""\n\n""Yes, ma\'am, so do I. That\'s just exactly how I feel too, ma\'am,"" agreed\nCharlotta the Fourth, who would have said precisely the same thing if\nAnne had remarked that she felt like a pelican of the wilderness. Always\nafter Anne had visited Echo Lodge Charlotta the Fourth mounted to her\nlittle room over the kitchen and tried before her looking glass to speak\nand look and move like Anne. Charlotta could never flatter herself\nthat she quite succeeded; but practice makes perfect, as Charlotta had\nlearned at school, and she fondly hoped that in time she might catch the\ntrick of that dainty uplift of chin, that quick, starry outflashing\nof eyes, that fashion of walking as if you were a bough swaying in the\nwind. It seemed so easy when you watched Anne. Charlotta the Fourth\nadmired Anne wholeheartedly. It was not that she thought her so very\nhandsome. Diana Barry\'s beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was\nmuch more to Charlotta the Fourth\'s taste than Anne\'s moonshine charm of\nluminous gray eyes and the pale, everchanging roses of her cheeks.\n\n""But I\'d rather look like you than be pretty,"" she told Anne sincerely.\n\nAnne laughed, sipped the honey from the tribute, and cast away the\nsting. She was used to taking her compliments mixed. Public opinion\nnever agreed on Anne\'s looks. People who had heard her called handsome\nmet her and were disappointed. People who had heard her called plain\nsaw her and wondered where other people\'s eyes were. Anne herself would\nnever believe that she had any claim to beauty. When she looked in the\nglass all she saw was a little pale face with seven freckles on the nose\nthereof. Her mirror never revealed to her the elusive, ever-varying play\nof feeling that came and went over her features like a rosy illuminating\nflame, or the charm of dream and laughter alternating in her big eyes.\n\nWhile Anne was not beautiful in any strictly defined sense of the word\nshe possessed a certain evasive charm and distinction of appearance that\nleft beholders with a pleasurable sense of satisfaction in that softly\nrounded girlhood of hers, with all its strongly felt potentialities.\nThose who knew Anne best felt, without realizing that they felt it, that\nher greatest attraction was the aura of possibility surrounding her. . .\nthe power of future development that was in her. She seemed to walk in\nan atmosphere of things about to happen.\n\nAs they picked, Charlotta the Fourth confided to Anne her fears\nregarding Miss Lavendar. The warm-hearted little handmaiden was honestly\nworried over her adored mistress\' condition.\n\n""Miss Lavendar isn\'t well, Miss Shirley, ma\'am. I\'m sure she isn\'t,\nthough she never complains. She hasn\'t seemed like herself this long\nwhile, ma\'am . . . not since that day you and Paul were here together\nbefore. I feel sure she caught cold that night, ma\'am. After you and him\nhad gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with\nnothing but a little shawl on her. There was a lot of snow on the walks\nand I feel sure she got a chill, ma\'am. Ever since then I\'ve noticed her\nacting tired and lonesome like. She don\'t seem to take an interest in\nanything, ma\'am. She never pretends company\'s coming, nor fixes up for\nit, nor nothing, ma\'am. It\'s only when you come she seems to chirk up a\nbit. And the worst sign of all, Miss Shirley, ma\'am . . ."" Charlotta the\nFourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly\nweird and awful symptom indeed . . . ""is that she never gets cross now\nwhen I breaks things. Why, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, yesterday I bruk\nher green and yaller bowl that\'s always stood on the bookcase. Her\ngrandmother brought it out from England and Miss Lavendar was awful\nchoice of it. I was dusting it just as careful, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, and\nit slipped out, so fashion, afore I could grab holt of it, and bruk into\nabout forty millyun pieces. I tell you I was sorry and scared. I thought\nMiss Lavendar would scold me awful, ma\'am; and I\'d ruther she had than\ntake it the way she did. She just come in and hardly looked at it and\nsaid, \'It\'s no matter, Charlotta. Take up the pieces and throw them\naway.\' Just like that, Miss Shirley, ma\'am . . . \'take up the pieces and\nthrow them away,\' as if it wasn\'t her grandmother\'s bowl from England.\nOh, she isn\'t well and I feel awful bad about it. She\'s got nobody to\nlook after her but me.""\n\nCharlotta the Fourth\'s eyes brimmed up with tears. Anne patted the\nlittle brown paw holding the cracked pink cup sympathetically.\n\n""I think Miss Lavendar needs a change, Charlotta. She stays here alone\ntoo much. Can\'t we induce her to go away for a little trip?""\n\nCharlotta shook her head, with its rampant bows, disconsolately.\n\n""I don\'t think so, Miss Shirley, ma\'am. Miss Lavendar hates visiting.\nShe\'s only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just\ngoes to see them as a family duty. Last time when she come home she said\nshe wasn\'t going to visit for family duty no more. \'I\'ve come home in\nlove with loneliness, Charlotta,\' she says to me, \'and I never want to\nstray from my own vine and fig tree again. My relations try so hard to\nmake an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me.\' Just like that,\nMiss Shirley, ma\'am. \'It has a very bad effect on me.\' So I don\'t think\nit would do any good to coax her to go visiting.""\n\n""We must see what can be done,"" said Anne decidedly, as she put the last\npossible berry in her pink cup. ""Just as soon as I have my vacation I\'ll\ncome through and spend a whole week with you. We\'ll have a picnic every\nday and pretend all sorts of interesting things, and see if we can\'t\ncheer Miss Lavendar up.""\n\n""That will be the very thing, Miss Shirley, ma\'am,"" exclaimed Charlotta\nthe Fourth in rapture. She was glad for Miss Lavendar\'s sake and for her\nown too. With a whole week in which to study Anne constantly she would\nsurely be able to learn how to move and behave like her.\n\nWhen the girls got back to Echo Lodge they found that Miss Lavendar\nand Paul had carried the little square table out of the kitchen to\nthe garden and had everything ready for tea. Nothing ever tasted so\ndelicious as those strawberries and cream, eaten under a great blue\nsky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds, and in the long\nshadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings. After tea Anne\nhelped Charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen, while Miss Lavendar sat\non the stone bench with Paul and heard all about his rock people. She\nwas a good listener, this sweet Miss Lavendar, but just at the last it\nstruck Paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the Twin Sailors.\n\n""Miss Lavendar, why do you look at me like that?"" he asked gravely.\n\n""How do I look, Paul?""\n\n""Just as if you were looking through me at somebody I put you in mind\nof,"" said Paul, who had such occasional flashes of uncanny insight that\nit wasn\'t quite safe to have secrets when he was about.\n\n""You do put me in mind of somebody I knew long ago,"" said Miss Lavendar\ndreamily.\n\n""When you were young?""\n\n""Yes, when I was young. Do I seem very old to you, Paul?""\n\n""Do you know, I can\'t make up my mind about that,"" said Paul\nconfidentially. ""Your hair looks old . . . I never knew a young person\nwith white hair. But your eyes are as young as my beautiful teacher\'s\nwhen you laugh. I tell you what, Miss Lavendar"" . . .  Paul\'s voice and\nface were as solemn as a judge\'s . . . ""I think you would make a splendid\nmother. You have just the right look in your eyes . . .  the look my\nlittle mother always had. I think it\'s a pity you haven\'t any boys of\nyour own.""\n\n""I have a little dream boy, Paul.""\n\n""Oh, have you really? How old is he?""\n\n""About your age I think. He ought to be older because I dreamed him long\nbefore you were born. But I\'ll never let him get any older than eleven\nor twelve; because if I did some day he might grow up altogether and\nthen I\'d lose him.""\n\n""I know,"" nodded Paul. ""That\'s the beauty of dream-people . . . they stay\nany age you want them. You and my beautiful teacher and me myself are\nthe only folks in the world that I know of that have dream-people. Isn\'t\nit funny and nice we should all know each other? But I guess that kind\nof people always find each other out. Grandma never has dream-people and\nMary Joe thinks I\'m wrong in the upper story because I have them. But I\nthink it\'s splendid to have them. YOU know, Miss Lavendar. Tell me all\nabout your little dream-boy.""\n\n""He has blue eyes and curly hair. He steals in and wakens me with a kiss\nevery morning. Then all day he plays here in the garden . . .  and I play\nwith him. Such games as we have. We run races and talk with the echoes;\nand I tell him stories. And when twilight comes . . .""\n\n""I know,"" interrupted Paul eagerly. ""He comes and sits beside you . . .\nSO . . . because of course at twelve he\'d be too big to climb into your\nlap  . . . and lays his head on your shoulder . . . SO . . . and you put\nyour arms about him and hold him tight, tight, and rest your cheek on\nhis head . . .  yes, that\'s the very way. Oh, you DO know, Miss\nLavendar.""\n\nAnne found the two of them there when she came out of the stone house,\nand something in Miss Lavendar\'s face made her hate to disturb them.\n\n""I\'m afraid we must go, Paul, if we want to get home before dark. Miss\nLavendar, I\'m going to invite myself to Echo Lodge for a whole week\npretty soon.""\n\n""If you come for a week I\'ll keep you for two,"" threatened Miss\nLavendar.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nThe Prince Comes Back to the Enchanted Palace\n\n\nThe last day of school came and went. A triumphant ""semi-annual\nexamination"" was held and Anne\'s pupils acquitted themselves splendidly.\nAt the close they gave her an address and a writing desk. All the girls\nand ladies present cried, and some of the boys had it cast up to them\nlater on that they cried too, although they always denied it.\n\nMrs. Harmon Andrews, Mrs. Peter Sloane, and Mrs. William Bell walked\nhome together and talked things over.\n\n""I do think it is such a pity Anne is leaving when the children seem\nso much attached to her,"" sighed Mrs. Peter Sloane, who had a habit of\nsighing over everything and even finished off her jokes that way. ""To\nbe sure,"" she added hastily, ""we all know we\'ll have a good teacher next\nyear too.""\n\n""Jane will do her duty, I\'ve no doubt,"" said Mrs. Andrews rather\nstiffly. ""I don\'t suppose she\'ll tell the children quite so many fairy\ntales or spend so much time roaming about the woods with them. But she\nhas her name on the Inspector\'s Roll of Honor and the Newbridge people\nare in a terrible state over her leaving.""\n\n""I\'m real glad Anne is going to college,"" said Mrs. Bell. ""She has\nalways wanted it and it will be a splendid thing for her.""\n\n""Well, I don\'t know."" Mrs. Andrews was determined not to agree fully\nwith anybody that day. ""I don\'t see that Anne needs any more education.\nShe\'ll probably be marrying Gilbert Blythe, if his infatuation for her\nlasts till he gets through college, and what good will Latin and Greek\ndo her then? If they taught you at college how to manage a man there\nmight be some sense in her going.""\n\nMrs. Harmon Andrews, so Avonlea gossip whispered, had never learned\nhow to manage her ""man,"" and as a result the Andrews household was not\nexactly a model of domestic happiness.\n\n""I see that the Charlottetown call to Mr. Allan is up before the\nPresbytery,"" said Mrs. Bell. ""That means we\'ll be losing him soon, I\nsuppose.""\n\n""They\'re not going before September,"" said Mrs. Sloane. ""It will be\na great loss to the community . . . though I always did think that Mrs.\nAllan dressed rather too gay for a minister\'s wife. But we are none of\nus perfect. Did you notice how neat and snug Mr. Harrison looked today?\nI never saw such a changed man. He goes to church every Sunday and has\nsubscribed to the salary.""\n\n""Hasn\'t that Paul Irving grown to be a big boy?"" said Mrs. Andrews. ""He\nwas such a mite for his age when he came here. I declare I hardly knew\nhim today. He\'s getting to look a lot like his father.""\n\n""He\'s a smart boy,"" said Mrs. Bell.\n\n""He\'s smart enough, but"" . . . Mrs. Andrews lowered her voice . . . ""I\nbelieve he tells queer stories. Gracie came home from school one day\nlast week with the greatest rigmarole he had told her about people who\nlived down at the shore . . . stories there couldn\'t be a word of truth\nin, you know. I told Gracie not to believe them, and she said Paul\ndidn\'t intend her to. But if he didn\'t what did he tell them to her\nfor?""\n\n""Anne says Paul is a genius,"" said Mrs. Sloane.\n\n""He may be. You never know what to expect of them Americans,"" said Mrs.\nAndrews. Mrs. Andrews\' only acquaintance with the word ""genius"" was\nderived from the colloquial fashion of calling any eccentric individual\n""a queer genius."" She probably thought, with Mary Joe, that it meant a\nperson with something wrong in his upper story.\n\nBack in the schoolroom Anne was sitting alone at her desk, as she had\nsat on the first day of school two years before, her face leaning on her\nhand, her dewy eyes looking wistfully out of the window to the Lake of\nShining Waters. Her heart was so wrung over the parting with her pupils\nthat for a moment college had lost all its charm. She still felt the\nclasp of Annetta Bell\'s arms about her neck and heard the childish\nwail, ""I\'ll NEVER love any teacher as much as you, Miss Shirley, never,\nnever.""\n\nFor two years she had worked earnestly and faithfully, making many\nmistakes and learning from them. She had had her reward. She had taught\nher scholars something, but she felt that they had taught her much\nmore . . . lessons of tenderness, self-control, innocent wisdom, lore\nof childish hearts. Perhaps she had not succeeded in ""inspiring"" any\nwonderful ambitions in her pupils, but she had taught them, more by her\nown sweet personality than by all her careful precepts, that it was good\nand necessary in the years that were before them to live their lives\nfinely and graciously, holding fast to truth and courtesy and kindness,\nkeeping aloof from all that savored of falsehood and meanness and\nvulgarity. They were, perhaps, all unconscious of having learned such\nlessons; but they would remember and practice them long after they had\nforgotten the capital of Afghanistan and the dates of the Wars of the\nRoses.\n\n""Another chapter in my life is closed,"" said Anne aloud, as she locked\nher desk. She really felt very sad over it; but the romance in the idea\nof that ""closed chapter"" did comfort her a little.\n\nAnne spent a fortnight at Echo Lodge early in her vacation and everybody\nconcerned had a good time.\n\nShe took Miss Lavendar on a shopping expedition to town and persuaded\nher to buy a new organdy dress; then came the excitement of cutting\nand making it together, while the happy Charlotta the Fourth basted and\nswept up clippings. Miss Lavendar had complained that she could not feel\nmuch interest in anything, but the sparkle came back to her eyes over\nher pretty dress.\n\n""What a foolish, frivolous person I must be,"" she sighed. ""I\'m\nwholesomely ashamed to think that a new dress . . .  even it is a\nforget-me-not organdy . . . should exhilarate me so, when a good\nconscience and an extra contribution to Foreign Missions couldn\'t do\nit.""\n\nMidway in her visit Anne went home to Green Gables for a day to mend the\ntwins\' stockings and settle up Davy\'s accumulated store of questions. In\nthe evening she went down to the shore road to see Paul Irving. As she\npassed by the low, square window of the Irving sitting room she caught\na glimpse of Paul on somebody\'s lap; but the next moment he came flying\nthrough the hall.\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley,"" he cried excitedly, ""you can\'t think what has\nhappened! Something so splendid. Father is here . . .  just think of that!\nFather is here! Come right in. Father, this is my beautiful teacher. YOU\nknow, father.""\n\nStephen Irving came forward to meet Anne with a smile. He was a tall,\nhandsome man of middle age, with iron-gray hair, deep-set, dark blue\neyes, and a strong, sad face, splendidly modeled about chin and brow.\nJust the face for a hero of romance, Anne thought with a thrill of\nintense satisfaction. It was so disappointing to meet someone who ought\nto be a hero and find him bald or stooped, or otherwise lacking in\nmanly beauty. Anne would have thought it dreadful if the object of Miss\nLavendar\'s romance had not looked the part.\n\n""So this is my little son\'s \'beautiful teacher,\' of whom I have heard\nso much,"" said Mr. Irving with a hearty handshake. ""Paul\'s letters have\nbeen so full of you, Miss Shirley, that I feel as if I were pretty well\nacquainted with you already. I want to thank you for what you have done\nfor Paul. I think that your influence has been just what he needed.\nMother is one of the best and dearest of women; but her robust,\nmatter-of-fact Scotch common sense could not always understand a\ntemperament like my laddie\'s. What was lacking in her you have supplied.\nBetween you, I think Paul\'s training in these two past years has been as\nnearly ideal as a motherless boy\'s could be.""\n\nEverybody likes to be appreciated. Under Mr. Irving\'s praise Anne\'s\nface ""burst flower like into rosy bloom,"" and the busy, weary man of the\nworld, looking at her, thought he had never seen a fairer, sweeter slip\nof girlhood than this little ""down east"" schoolteacher with her red hair\nand wonderful eyes.\n\nPaul sat between them blissfully happy.\n\n""I never dreamed father was coming,"" he said radiantly. ""Even Grandma\ndidn\'t know it. It was a great surprise. As a general thing . . ."" Paul\nshook his brown curls gravely . . . ""I don\'t like to be surprised. You\nlose all the fun of expecting things when you\'re surprised. But in a\ncase like this it is all right. Father came last night after I had gone\nto bed. And after Grandma and Mary Joe had stopped being surprised he\nand Grandma came upstairs to look at me, not meaning to wake me up till\nmorning. But I woke right up and saw father. I tell you I just sprang at\nhim.""\n\n""With a hug like a bear\'s,"" said Mr. Irving, putting his arms around\nPaul\'s shoulder smilingly. ""I hardly knew my boy, he had grown so big\nand brown and sturdy.""\n\n""I don\'t know which was the most pleased to see father, Grandma or I,""\ncontinued Paul. ""Grandma\'s been in kitchen all day making the things\nfather likes to eat. She wouldn\'t trust them to Mary Joe, she says.\nThat\'s HER way of showing gladness. _I_ like best just to sit and talk\nto father. But I\'m going to leave you for a little while now if you\'ll\nexcuse me. I must get the cows for Mary Joe. That is one of my daily\nduties.""\n\nWhen Paul had scampered away to do his ""daily duty"" Mr. Irving talked to\nAnne of various matters. But Anne felt that he was thinking of something\nelse underneath all the time. Presently it came to the surface.\n\n""In Paul\'s last letter he spoke of going with you to visit an old . . .\nfriend of mine . . . Miss Lewis at the stone house in Grafton. Do you know\nher well?""\n\n""Yes, indeed, she is a very dear friend of mine,"" was Anne\'s demure\nreply, which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her\nfrom head to foot at Mr. Irving\'s question. Anne ""felt instinctively""\nthat romance was peeping at her around a corner.\n\nMr. Irving rose and went to the window, looking out on a great, golden,\nbillowing sea where a wild wind was harping. For a few moments there was\nsilence in the little dark-walled room. Then he turned and looked down\ninto Anne\'s sympathetic face with a smile, half-whimsical, half-tender.\n\n""I wonder how much you know,"" he said.\n\n""I know all about it,"" replied Anne promptly. ""You see,"" she explained\nhastily, ""Miss Lavendar and I are very intimate. She wouldn\'t tell\nthings of such a sacred nature to everybody. We are kindred spirits.""\n\n""Yes, I believe you are. Well, I am going to ask a favor of you. I would\nlike to go and see Miss Lavendar if she will let me. Will you ask her if\nI may come?""\n\nWould she not? Oh, indeed she would! Yes, this was romance, the very,\nthe real thing, with all the charm of rhyme and story and dream. It was\na little belated, perhaps, like a rose blooming in October which should\nhave bloomed in June; but none the less a rose, all sweetness and\nfragrance, with the gleam of gold in its heart. Never did Anne\'s\nfeet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the\nbeechwoods to Grafton the next morning. She found Miss Lavendar in the\ngarden. Anne was fearfully excited. Her hands grew cold and her voice\ntrembled.\n\n""Miss Lavendar, I have something to tell you . . . something very\nimportant. Can you guess what it is?""\n\nAnne never supposed that Miss Lavendar could GUESS; but Miss Lavendar\'s\nface grew very pale and Miss Lavendar said in a quiet, still voice,\nfrom which all the color and sparkle that Miss Lavendar\'s voice usually\nsuggested had faded.\n\n""Stephen Irving is home?""\n\n""How did you know? Who told you?"" cried Anne disappointedly, vexed that\nher great revelation had been anticipated.\n\n""Nobody. I knew that must be it, just from the way you spoke.""\n\n""He wants to come and see you,"" said Anne. ""May I send him word that he\nmay?""\n\n""Yes, of course,"" fluttered Miss Lavendar. ""There is no reason why he\nshouldn\'t. He is only coming as any old friend might.""\n\nAnne had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to\nwrite a note at Miss Lavendar\'s desk.\n\n""Oh, it\'s delightful to be living in a storybook,"" she thought gaily.\n""It will come out all right of course . . . it must . . . and Paul will\nhave a mother after his own heart and everybody will be happy. But Mr.\nIrving will take Miss Lavendar away . . . and dear knows what will\nhappen to the little stone house . . . and so there are two sides to it,\nas there seems to be to everything in this world."" The important note\nwas written and Anne herself carried it to the Grafton post office,\nwhere she waylaid the mail carrier and asked him to leave it at the\nAvonlea office.\n\n""It\'s so very important,"" Anne assured him anxiously. The mail carrier\nwas a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a\nmessenger of Cupid; and Anne was none too certain that his memory was to\nbe trusted. But he said he would do his best to remember and she had to\nbe contented with that.\n\nCharlotta the Fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house\nthat afternoon . . . a mystery from which she was excluded. Miss Lavendar\nroamed about the garden in a distracted fashion. Anne, too, seemed\npossessed by a demon of unrest, and walked to and fro and went up and\ndown. Charlotta the Fourth endured it till patience ceased to be a\nvirtue; then she confronted Anne on the occasion of that romantic young\nperson\'s third aimless peregrination through the kitchen.\n\n""Please, Miss Shirley, ma\'am,"" said Charlotta the Fourth, with an\nindignant toss of her very blue bows, ""it\'s plain to be seen you and\nMiss Lavendar have got a secret and I think, begging your pardon if I\'m\ntoo forward, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, that it\'s real mean not to tell me\nwhen we\'ve all been such chums.""\n\n""Oh, Charlotta dear, I\'d have told you all about it if it were my\nsecret . . . but it\'s Miss Lavendar\'s, you see. However, I\'ll tell you\nthis much . . . and if nothing comes of it you must never breathe a word\nabout it to a living soul. You see, Prince Charming is coming tonight.\nHe came long ago, but in a foolish moment went away and wandered afar\nand forgot the secret of the magic pathway to the enchanted castle,\nwhere the princess was weeping her faithful heart out for him. But\nat last he remembered it again and the princess is waiting still. . .\nbecause nobody but her own dear prince could carry her off.""\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, what is that in prose?"" gasped the mystified\nCharlotta.\n\nAnne laughed.\n\n""In prose, an old friend of Miss Lavendar\'s is coming to see her\ntonight.""\n\n""Do you mean an old beau of hers?"" demanded the literal Charlotta.\n\n""That is probably what I do mean . . . in prose,"" answered Anne gravely.\n""It is Paul\'s father . . . Stephen Irving. And goodness knows what will\ncome of it, but let us hope for the best, Charlotta.""\n\n""I hope that he\'ll marry Miss Lavendar,"" was Charlotta\'s unequivocal\nresponse. ""Some women\'s intended from the start to be old maids, and I\'m\nafraid I\'m one of them, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, because I\'ve awful little\npatience with the men. But Miss Lavendar never was. And I\'ve been awful\nworried, thinking what on earth she\'d do when I got so big I\'d HAVE to\ngo to Boston. There ain\'t any more girls in our family and dear\nknows what she\'d do if she got some stranger that might laugh at her\npretendings and leave things lying round out of their place and not\nbe willing to be called Charlotta the Fifth. She might get someone who\nwouldn\'t be as unlucky as me in breaking dishes but she\'d never get\nanyone who\'d love her better.""\n\nAnd the faithful little handmaiden dashed to the oven door with a sniff.\n\nThey went through the form of having tea as usual that night at Echo\nLodge; but nobody really ate anything. After tea Miss Lavendar went to\nher room and put on her new forget-me-not organdy, while Anne did her\nhair for her. Both were dreadfully excited; but Miss Lavendar pretended\nto be very calm and indifferent.\n\n""I must really mend that rent in the curtain tomorrow,"" she said\nanxiously, inspecting it as if it were the only thing of any importance\njust then. ""Those curtains have not worn as well as they should,\nconsidering the price I paid. Dear me, Charlotta has forgotten to dust\nthe stair railing AGAIN. I really MUST speak to her about it.""\n\nAnne was sitting on the porch steps when Stephen Irving came down the\nlane and across the garden.\n\n""This is the one place where time stands still,"" he said, looking around\nhim with delighted eyes. ""There is nothing changed about this house or\ngarden since I was here twenty-five years ago. It makes me feel young\nagain.""\n\n""You know time always does stand still in an enchanted palace,"" said\nAnne seriously. ""It is only when the prince comes that things begin to\nhappen.""\n\nMr. Irving smiled a little sadly into her uplifted face, all astar with\nits youth and promise.\n\n""Sometimes the prince comes too late,"" he said. He did not ask Anne\nto translate her remark into prose. Like all kindred spirits he\n""understood.""\n\n""Oh, no, not if he is the real prince coming to the true princess,"" said\nAnne, shaking her red head decidedly, as she opened the parlor door.\nWhen he had gone in she shut it tightly behind him and turned to\nconfront Charlotta the Fourth, who was in the hall, all ""nods and becks\nand wreathed smiles.""\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am,"" she breathed, ""I peeked from the kitchen\nwindow . . . and he\'s awful handsome . . . and just the right age for Miss\nLavendar. And oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, do you think it would be much\nharm to listen at the door?""\n\n""It would be dreadful, Charlotta,"" said Anne firmly, ""so just you come\naway with me out of the reach of temptation.""\n\n""I can\'t do anything, and it\'s awful to hang round just waiting,"" sighed\nCharlotta. ""What if he don\'t propose after all, Miss Shirley, ma\'am?\nYou can never be sure of them men. My older sister, Charlotta the\nFirst, thought she was engaged to one once. But it turned out HE had a\ndifferent opinion and she says she\'ll never trust one of them again. And\nI heard of another case where a man thought he wanted one girl awful bad\nwhen it was really her sister he wanted all the time. When a man don\'t\nknow his own mind, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, how\'s a poor woman going to be\nsure of it?""\n\n""We\'ll go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons,"" said Anne.\n""That\'s a task which won\'t require much thinking fortunately . . .  for I\nCOULDN\'T think tonight. And it will pass the time.""\n\nIt passed an hour. Then, just as Anne laid down the last shining spoon,\nthey heard the front door shut. Both sought comfort fearfully in each\nother\'s eyes.\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am,"" gasped Charlotta, ""if he\'s going away this\nearly there\'s nothing into it and never will be."" They flew to the\nwindow. Mr. Irving had no intention of going away. He and Miss Lavendar\nwere strolling slowly down the middle path to the stone bench.\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, he\'s got his arm around her waist,"" whispered\nCharlotta the Fourth delightedly. ""He must have proposed to her or she\'d\nnever allow it.""\n\nAnne caught Charlotta the Fourth by her own plump waist and danced her\naround the kitchen until they were both out of breath.\n\n""Oh, Charlotta,"" she cried gaily, ""I\'m neither a prophetess nor the\ndaughter of a prophetess but I\'m going to make a prediction. There\'ll\nbe a wedding in this old stone house before the maple leaves are red. Do\nyou want that translated into prose, Charlotta?""\n\n""No, I can understand that,"" said Charlotta. ""A wedding ain\'t poetry.\nWhy, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, you\'re crying! What for?""\n\n""Oh, because it\'s all so beautiful . . . and story bookish . . . and\nromantic . . . and sad,"" said Anne, winking the tears out of her eyes.\n""It\'s all perfectly lovely . . . but there\'s a little sadness mixed up in\nit too, somehow.""\n\n""Oh, of course there\'s a resk in marrying anybody,"" conceded Charlotta\nthe Fourth, ""but, when all\'s said and done, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, there\'s\nmany a worse thing than a husband.""\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nPoetry and Prose\n\n\nFor the next month Anne lived in what, for Avonlea, might be called\na whirl of excitement. The preparation of her own modest outfit for\nRedmond was of secondary importance. Miss Lavendar was getting ready to\nbe married and the stone house was the scene of endless consultations\nand plannings and discussions, with Charlotta the Fourth hovering on the\noutskirts of things in agitated delight and wonder. Then the dressmaker\ncame, and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions\nand being fitted. Anne and Diana spent half their time at Echo Lodge and\nthere were nights when Anne could not sleep for wondering whether she\nhad done right in advising Miss Lavendar to select brown rather than\nnavy blue for her traveling dress, and to have her gray silk made\nprincess.\n\nEverybody concerned in Miss Lavendar\'s story was very happy. Paul Irving\nrushed to Green Gables to talk the news over with Anne as soon as his\nfather had told him.\n\n""I knew I could trust father to pick me out a nice little second\nmother,"" he said proudly. ""It\'s a fine thing to have a father you can\ndepend on, teacher. I just love Miss Lavendar. Grandma is pleased, too.\nShe says she\'s real glad father didn\'t pick out an American for his\nsecond wife, because, although it turned out all right the first time,\nsuch a thing wouldn\'t be likely to happen twice. Mrs. Lynde says she\nthoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely Miss Lavendar\nwill give up her queer notions and be like other people, now that she\'s\ngoing to be married. But I hope she won\'t give her queer notions up,\nteacher, because I like them. And I don\'t want her to be like other\npeople. There are too many other people around as it is. YOU know,\nteacher.""\n\nCharlotta the Fourth was another radiant person.\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, it has all turned out so beautiful. When Mr.\nIrving and Miss Lavendar come back from their tower I\'m to go up to\nBoston and live with them . . . and me only fifteen, and the other girls\nnever went till they were sixteen. Ain\'t Mr. Irving splendid? He\njust worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer\nsometimes to see the look in his eyes when he\'s watching her. It beggars\ndescription, Miss Shirley, ma\'am. I\'m awful thankful they\'re so fond\nof each other. It\'s the best way, when all\'s said and done, though some\nfolks can get along without it. I\'ve got an aunt who has been married\nthree times and says she married the first time for love and the last\ntwo times for strictly business, and was happy with all three except at\nthe times of the funerals. But I think she took a resk, Miss Shirley,\nma\'am.""\n\n""Oh, it\'s all so romantic,"" breathed Anne to Marilla that night. ""If I\nhadn\'t taken the wrong path that day we went to Mr. Kimball\'s I\'d never\nhave known Miss Lavendar; and if I hadn\'t met her I\'d never have taken\nPaul there . . . and he\'d never have written to his father about visiting\nMiss Lavendar just as Mr. Irving was starting for San Francisco. Mr.\nIrving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his\npartner to San Francisco and come here instead. He hadn\'t heard anything\nof Miss Lavendar for fifteen years. Somebody had told him then that\nshe was to be married and he thought she was and never asked anybody\nanything about her. And now everything has come right. And I had a\nhand in bringing it about. Perhaps, as Mrs. Lynde says, everything is\nforeordained and it was bound to happen anyway. But even so, it\'s nice\nto think one was an instrument used by predestination. Yes indeed, it\'s\nvery romantic.""\n\n""I can\'t see that it\'s so terribly romantic at all,"" said Marilla rather\ncrisply. Marilla thought Anne was too worked up about it and had plenty\nto do with getting ready for college without ""traipsing"" to Echo Lodge\ntwo days out of three helping Miss Lavendar. ""In the first place two\nyoung fools quarrel and turn sulky; then Steve Irving goes to the States\nand after a spell gets married up there and is perfectly happy from all\naccounts. Then his wife dies and after a decent interval he thinks he\'ll\ncome home and see if his first fancy\'ll have him. Meanwhile, she\'s been\nliving single, probably because nobody nice enough came along to want\nher, and they meet and agree to be married after all. Now, where is the\nromance in all that?""\n\n""Oh, there isn\'t any, when you put it that way,"" gasped Anne, rather\nas if somebody had thrown cold water over her. ""I suppose that\'s how\nit looks in prose. But it\'s very different if you look at it through\npoetry . . . and _I_ think it\'s nicer . . ."" Anne recovered herself and\nher eyes shone and her cheeks flushed . . . ""to look at it through\npoetry.""\n\nMarilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further\nsarcastic comments. Perhaps some realization came to her that after all\nit was better to have, like Anne, ""the vision and the faculty divine""\n. . . that gift which the world cannot bestow or take away, of looking at\nlife through some transfiguring . . . or revealing? . . . medium, whereby\neverything seemed apparelled in celestial light, wearing a glory and\na freshness not visible to those who, like herself and Charlotta the\nFourth, looked at things only through prose.\n\n""When\'s the wedding to be?"" she asked after a pause.\n\n""The last Wednesday in August. They are to be married in the garden\nunder the honeysuckle trellis . . . the very spot where Mr. Irving\nproposed to her twenty-five years ago. Marilla, that IS romantic, even\nin prose. There\'s to be nobody there except Mrs. Irving and Paul and\nGilbert and Diana and I, and Miss Lavendar\'s cousins. And they will\nleave on the six o\'clock train for a trip to the Pacific coast. When\nthey come back in the fall Paul and Charlotta the Fourth are to go up to\nBoston to live with them. But Echo Lodge is to be left just as it is. . .\nonly of course they\'ll sell the hens and cow, and board up the windows\n. . . and every summer they\'re coming down to live in it. I\'m so glad. It\nwould have hurt me dreadfully next winter at Redmond to think of that\ndear stone house all stripped and deserted, with empty rooms . . . or far\nworse still, with other people living in it. But I can think of it now,\njust as I\'ve always seen it, waiting happily for the summer to bring\nlife and laughter back to it again.""\n\nThere was more romance in the world than that which had fallen to\nthe share of the middle-aged lovers of the stone house. Anne stumbled\nsuddenly on it one evening when she went over to Orchard Slope by the\nwood cut and came out into the Barry garden. Diana Barry and Fred Wright\nwere standing together under the big willow. Diana was leaning against\nthe gray trunk, her lashes cast down on very crimson cheeks. One hand\nwas held by Fred, who stood with his face bent toward her, stammering\nsomething in low earnest tones. There were no other people in the world\nexcept their two selves at that magic moment; so neither of them saw\nAnne, who, after one dazed glance of comprehension, turned and sped\nnoiselessly back through the spruce wood, never stopping till she gained\nher own gable room, where she sat breathlessly down by her window and\ntried to collect her scattered wits.\n\n""Diana and Fred are in love with each other,"" she gasped. ""Oh, it does\nseem so . . . so . . . so HOPELESSLY grown up.""\n\nAnne, of late, had not been without her suspicions that Diana was\nproving false to the melancholy Byronic hero of her early dreams. But\nas ""things seen are mightier than things heard,"" or suspected, the\nrealization that it was actually so came to her with almost the shock of\nperfect surprise. This was succeeded by a queer, little lonely feeling\n. . . as if, somehow, Diana had gone forward into a new world, shutting\na gate behind her, leaving Anne on the outside.\n\n""Things are changing so fast it almost frightens me,"" Anne thought,\na little sadly. ""And I\'m afraid that this can\'t help making some\ndifference between Diana and me. I\'m sure I can\'t tell her all my\nsecrets after this . . . she might tell Fred. And what CAN she see in\nFred? He\'s very nice and jolly . . . but he\'s just Fred Wright.""\n\nIt is always a very puzzling question . . . what can somebody see in\nsomebody else? But how fortunate after all that it is so, for if\neverybody saw alike . . . well, in that case, as the old Indian said,\n""Everybody would want my squaw."" It was plain that Diana DID see\nsomething in Fred Wright, however Anne\'s eyes might be holden. Diana\ncame to Green Gables the next evening, a pensive, shy young lady, and\ntold Anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the east gable. Both\ngirls cried and kissed and laughed.\n\n""I\'m so happy,"" said Diana, ""but it does seem ridiculous to think of me\nbeing engaged.""\n\n""What is it really like to be engaged?"" asked Anne curiously.\n\n""Well, that all depends on who you\'re engaged to,"" answered Diana, with\nthat maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those who are\nengaged over those who are not. ""It\'s perfectly lovely to be engaged to\nFred . . . but I think it would be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone\nelse.""\n\n""There\'s not much comfort for the rest of us in that, seeing that there\nis only one Fred,"" laughed Anne.\n\n""Oh, Anne, you don\'t understand,"" said Diana in vexation. ""I didn\'t\nmean THAT . . . it\'s so hard to explain. Never mind, you\'ll understand\nsometime, when your own turn comes.""\n\n""Bless you, dearest of Dianas, I understand now. What is an imagination\nfor if not to enable you to peep at life through other people\'s eyes?""\n\n""You must be my bridesmaid, you know, Anne. Promise me that . . .\nwherever you may be when I\'m married.""\n\n""I\'ll come from the ends of the earth if necessary,"" promised Anne\nsolemnly.\n\n""Of course, it won\'t be for ever so long yet,"" said Diana, blushing.\n""Three years at the very least . . . for I\'m only eighteen and mother says\nno daughter of hers shall be married before she\'s twenty-one. Besides,\nFred\'s father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm for him and he\nsays he\'s got to have it two thirds paid for before he\'ll give it to him\nin his own name. But three years isn\'t any too much time to get ready\nfor housekeeping, for I haven\'t a speck of fancy work made yet. But I\'m\ngoing to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow. Myra Gillis had thirty-seven\ndoilies when she was married and I\'m determined I shall have as many as\nshe had.""\n\n""I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only\nthirty-six doilies,"" conceded Anne, with a solemn face but dancing eyes.\n\nDiana looked hurt.\n\n""I didn\'t think you\'d make fun of me, Anne,"" she said reproachfully.\n\n""Dearest, I wasn\'t making fun of you,"" cried Anne repentantly. ""I\nwas only teasing you a bit. I think you\'ll make the sweetest little\nhousekeeper in the world. And I think it\'s perfectly lovely of you to be\nplanning already for your home o\'dreams.""\n\nAnne had no sooner uttered the phrase, ""home o\'dreams,"" than it\ncaptivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one of\nher own. It was, of course, tenanted by an ideal master, dark, proud,\nand melancholy; but oddly enough, Gilbert Blythe persisted in hanging\nabout too, helping her arrange pictures, lay out gardens, and accomplish\nsundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero evidently\nconsidered beneath his dignity. Anne tried to banish Gilbert\'s image\nfrom her castle in Spain but, somehow, he went on being there, so\nAnne, being in a hurry, gave up the attempt and pursued her aerial\narchitecture with such success that her ""home o\'dreams"" was built and\nfurnished before Diana spoke again.\n\n""I suppose, Anne, you must think it\'s funny I should like Fred so well\nwhen he\'s so different from the kind of man I\'ve always said I would\nmarry . . . the tall, slender kind? But somehow I wouldn\'t want Fred to be\ntall and slender . . . because, don\'t you see, he wouldn\'t be Fred then.\nOf course,"" added Diana rather dolefully, ""we will be a dreadfully pudgy\ncouple. But after all that\'s better than one of us being short and fat\nand the other tall and lean, like Morgan Sloane and his wife. Mrs. Lynde\nsays it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees\nthem together.""\n\n""Well,"" said Anne to herself that night, as she brushed her hair before\nher gilt framed mirror, ""I am glad Diana is so happy and satisfied.\nBut when my turn comes . . . if it ever does . . . I do hope there\'ll be\nsomething a little more thrilling about it. But then Diana thought so\ntoo, once. I\'ve heard her say time and again she\'d never get engaged any\npoky commonplace way . . . he\'d HAVE to do something splendid to win her.\nBut she has changed. Perhaps I\'ll change too. But I won\'t . . . and\nI\'m determined I won\'t. Oh, I think these engagements are dreadfully\nunsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends.""\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nA Wedding at the Stone House\n\nThe last week in August came. Miss Lavendar was to be married in it.\nTwo weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College. In a\nweek\'s time Mrs. Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and set up\nher lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room, which was already\nprepared for her coming. She had sold all her superfluous household\nplenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial\noccupation of helping the Allans pack up. Mr. Allan was to preach his\nfarewell sermon the next Sunday. The old order was changing rapidly to\ngive place to the new, as Anne felt with a little sadness threading all\nher excitement and happiness.\n\n""Changes ain\'t totally pleasant but they\'re excellent things,"" said Mr.\nHarrison philosophically. ""Two years is about long enough for things\nto stay exactly the same. If they stayed put any longer they might grow\nmossy.""\n\nMr. Harrison was smoking on his veranda. His wife had self-sacrificingly\ntold that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an\nopen window. Mr. Harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors\naltogether to smoke in fine weather, and so mutual goodwill reigned.\n\nAnne had come over to ask Mrs. Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias.\nShe and Diana were going through to Echo Lodge that evening to help Miss\nLavendar and Charlotta the Fourth with their final preparations for the\nmorrow\'s bridal. Miss Lavendar herself never had dahlias; she did not\nlike them and they would not have suited the fine retirement of her\nold-fashioned garden. But flowers of any kind were rather scarce in\nAvonlea and the neighboring districts that summer, thanks to Uncle Abe\'s\nstorm; and Anne and Diana thought that a certain old cream-colored stone\njug, usually kept sacred to doughnuts, brimmed over with yellow dahlias,\nwould be just the thing to set in a dim angle of the stone house stairs,\nagainst the dark background of red hall paper.\n\n""I s\'pose you\'ll be starting off for college in a fortnight\'s time?""\ncontinued Mr. Harrison. ""Well, we\'re going to miss you an awful lot,\nEmily and me. To be sure, Mrs. Lynde\'ll be over there in your place.\nThere ain\'t nobody but a substitute can be found for them.""\n\nThe irony of Mr. Harrison\'s tone is quite untransferable to paper. In\nspite of his wife\'s intimacy with Mrs. Lynde, the best that could be\nsaid of the relationship between her and Mr. Harrison even under the new\nregime, was that they preserved an armed neutrality.\n\n""Yes, I\'m going,"" said Anne. ""I\'m very glad with my head . . . and very\nsorry with my heart.""\n\n""I s\'pose you\'ll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round\nloose at Redmond.""\n\n""I may try for one or two of them,"" confessed Anne, ""but I don\'t care so\nmuch for things like that as I did two years ago. What I want to get out\nof my college course is some knowledge of the best way of living life\nand doing the most and best with it. I want to learn to understand and\nhelp other people and myself.""\n\nMr. Harrison nodded.\n\n""That\'s the idea exactly. That\'s what college ought to be for, instead\nof for turning out a lot of B.A.\'s, so chock full of book-learning\nand vanity that there ain\'t room for anything else. You\'re all right.\nCollege won\'t be able to do you much harm, I reckon.""\n\nDiana and Anne drove over to Echo Lodge after tea, taking with them all\nthe flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their own and\ntheir neighbors\' gardens had yielded. They found the stone house agog\nwith excitement. Charlotta the Fourth was flying around with such vim\nand briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess the power of\nbeing everywhere at once. Like the helmet of Navarre, Charlotta\'s blue\nbows waved ever in the thickest of the fray.\n\n""Praise be to goodness you\'ve come,"" she said devoutly, ""for there\'s\nheaps of things to do . . . and the frosting on that cake WON\'T harden\n. . . and there\'s all the silver to be rubbed up yet . . .  and the\nhorsehair trunk to be packed . . . and the roosters for the chicken\nsalad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet, crowing, Miss\nShirley, ma\'am. And Miss Lavendar ain\'t to be trusted to do a thing. I\nwas thankful when Mr. Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for\na walk in the woods. Courting\'s all right in its place, Miss Shirley,\nma\'am, but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring\neverything\'s spoiled. That\'s MY opinion, Miss Shirley, ma\'am.""\n\nAnne and Diana worked so heartily that by ten o\'clock even Charlotta\nthe Fourth was satisfied. She braided her hair in innumerable plaits and\ntook her weary little bones off to bed.\n\n""But I\'m sure I shan\'t sleep a blessed wink, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, for\nfear that something\'ll go wrong at the last minute . . . the cream won\'t\nwhip . . . or Mr. Irving\'ll have a stroke and not be able to come.""\n\n""He isn\'t in the habit of having strokes, is he?"" asked Diana, the\ndimpled corners of her mouth twitching. To Diana, Charlotta the Fourth\nwas, if not exactly a thing of beauty, certainly a joy forever.\n\n""They\'re not things that go by habit,"" said Charlotta the Fourth with\ndignity. ""They just HAPPEN . . . and there you are. ANYBODY can have a\nstroke. You don\'t have to learn how. Mr. Irving looks a lot like an\nuncle of mine that had one once just as he was sitting down to dinner\none day. But maybe everything\'ll go all right. In this world you\'ve just\ngot to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God\nsends.""\n\n""The only thing I\'m worried about is that it won\'t be fine tomorrow,""\nsaid Diana. ""Uncle Abe predicted rain for the middle of the week, and\never since the big storm I can\'t help believing there\'s a good deal in\nwhat Uncle Abe says.""\n\nAnne, who knew better than Diana just how much Uncle Abe had to do with\nthe storm, was not much disturbed by this. She slept the sleep of the\njust and weary, and was roused at an unearthly hour by Charlotta the\nFourth.\n\n""Oh, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, it\'s awful to call you so early,"" came wailing\nthrough the keyhole, ""but there\'s so much to do yet . . . and oh, Miss\nShirley, ma\'am, I\'m skeered it\'s going to rain and I wish you\'d get up\nand tell me you think it ain\'t."" Anne flew to the window, hoping against\nhope that Charlotta the Fourth was saying this merely by way of rousing\nher effectually. But alas, the morning did look unpropitious. Below the\nwindow Miss Lavendar\'s garden, which should have been a glory of pale\nvirgin sunshine, lay dim and windless; and the sky over the firs was\ndark with moody clouds.\n\n""Isn\'t it too mean!"" said Diana.\n\n""We must hope for the best,"" said Anne determinedly. ""If it only doesn\'t\nactually rain, a cool, pearly gray day like this would really be nicer\nthan hot sunshine.""\n\n""But it will rain,"" mourned Charlotta, creeping into the room, a figure\nof fun, with her many braids wound about her head, the ends, tied up\nwith white thread, sticking out in all directions. ""It\'ll hold off till\nthe last minute and then pour cats and dogs. And all the folks will get\nsopping . . . and track mud all over the house . . . and they won\'t be\nable to be married under the honeysuckle . . . and it\'s awful unlucky\nfor no sun to shine on a bride, say what you will, Miss Shirley, ma\'am.\n_I_ knew things were going too well to last.""\n\nCharlotta the Fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out of\nMiss Eliza Andrews\' book.\n\nIt did not rain, though it kept on looking as if it meant to. By noon\nthe rooms were decorated, the table beautifully laid; and upstairs was\nwaiting a bride, ""adorned for her husband.""\n\n""You do look sweet,"" said Anne rapturously.\n\n""Lovely,"" echoed Diana.\n\n""Everything\'s ready, Miss Shirley, ma\'am, and nothing dreadful has\nhappened YET,"" was Charlotta\'s cheerful statement as she betook herself\nto her little back room to dress. Out came all the braids; the resultant\nrampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and tied, not with two\nbows alone, but with four, of brand-new ribbon, brightly blue. The two\nupper bows rather gave the impression of overgrown wings sprouting from\nCharlotta\'s neck, somewhat after the fashion of Raphael\'s cherubs. But\nCharlotta the Fourth thought them very beautiful, and after she had\nrustled into a white dress, so stiffly starched that it could stand\nalone, she surveyed herself in her glass with great satisfaction . . . a\nsatisfaction which lasted until she went out in the hall and caught\na glimpse through the spare room door of a tall girl in some softly\nclinging gown, pinning white, star-like flowers on the smooth ripples of\nher ruddy hair.\n\n""Oh, I\'ll NEVER be able to look like Miss Shirley,"" thought poor\nCharlotta despairingly. ""You just have to be born so, I guess . . .  don\'t\nseem\'s if any amount of practice could give you that AIR.""\n\nBy one o\'clock the guests had come, including Mr. and Mrs. Allan, for\nMr. Allan was to perform the ceremony in the absence of the Grafton\nminister on his vacation. There was no formality about the marriage.\nMiss Lavendar came down the stairs to meet her bridegroom at the foot,\nand as he took her hand she lifted her big brown eyes to his with a look\nthat made Charlotta the Fourth, who intercepted it, feel queerer than\never. They went out to the honeysuckle arbor, where Mr. Allan was\nawaiting them. The guests grouped themselves as they pleased. Anne and\nDiana stood by the old stone bench, with Charlotta the Fourth between\nthem, desperately clutching their hands in her cold, tremulous little\npaws.\n\nMr. Allan opened his blue book and the ceremony proceeded. Just as\nMiss Lavendar and Stephen Irving were pronounced man and wife a very\nbeautiful and symbolic thing happened. The sun suddenly burst through\nthe gray and poured a flood of radiance on the happy bride. Instantly\nthe garden was alive with dancing shadows and flickering lights.\n\n""What a lovely omen,"" thought Anne, as she ran to kiss the bride. Then\nthe three girls left the rest of the guests laughing around the bridal\npair while they flew into the house to see that all was in readiness for\nthe feast.\n\n""Thanks be to goodness, it\'s over, Miss Shirley, ma\'am,"" breathed\nCharlotta the Fourth, ""and they\'re married safe and sound, no matter\nwhat happens now. The bags of rice are in the pantry, ma\'am, and the old\nshoes are behind the door, and the cream for whipping is on the sullar\nsteps.""\n\nAt half past two Mr. and Mrs. Irving left, and everybody went to Bright\nRiver to see them off on the afternoon train. As Miss Lavendar . . . I\nbeg her pardon, Mrs. Irving . . . stepped from the door of her old home\nGilbert and the girls threw the rice and Charlotta the Fourth hurled an\nold shoe with such excellent aim that she struck Mr. Allan squarely on\nthe head. But it was reserved for Paul to give the prettiest send-off.\nHe popped out of the porch ringing furiously a huge old brass dinner\nbell which had adorned the dining room mantel. Paul\'s only motive was to\nmake a joyful noise; but as the clangor died away, from point and curve\nand hill across the river came the chime of ""fairy wedding bells,""\nringing clearly, sweetly, faintly and more faint, as if Miss Lavendar\'s\nbeloved echoes were bidding her greeting and farewell. And so, amid this\nbenediction of sweet sounds, Miss Lavendar drove away from the old life\nof dreams and make-believes to a fuller life of realities in the busy\nworld beyond.\n\nTwo hours later Anne and Charlotta the Fourth came down the lane again.\nGilbert had gone to West Grafton on an errand and Diana had to keep an\nengagement at home. Anne and Charlotta had come back to put things in\norder and lock up the little stone house. The garden was a pool of late\ngolden sunshine, with butterflies hovering and bees booming; but the\nlittle house had already that indefinable air of desolation which always\nfollows a festivity.\n\n""Oh dear me, don\'t it look lonesome?"" sniffed Charlotta the Fourth, who\nhad been crying all the way home from the station. ""A wedding ain\'t much\ncheerfuller than a funeral after all, when it\'s all over, Miss Shirley,\nma\'am.""\n\nA busy evening followed. The decorations had to be removed, the dishes\nwashed, the uneaten delicacies packed into a basket for the delectation\nof Charlotta the Fourth\'s young brothers at home. Anne would not rest\nuntil everything was in apple-pie order; after Charlotta had gone home\nwith her plunder Anne went over the still rooms, feeling like one who\ntrod alone some banquet hall deserted, and closed the blinds. Then\nshe locked the door and sat down under the silver poplar to wait for\nGilbert, feeling very tired but still unweariedly thinking ""long, long\nthoughts.""\n\n""What are you thinking of, Anne?"" asked Gilbert, coming down the walk.\nHe had left his horse and buggy out at the road.\n\n""Of Miss Lavendar and Mr. Irving,"" answered Anne dreamily. ""Isn\'t it\nbeautiful to think how everything has turned out . . . how they have come\ntogether again after all the years of separation and misunderstanding?""\n\n""Yes, it\'s beautiful,"" said Gilbert, looking steadily down into Anne\'s\nuplifted face, ""but wouldn\'t it have been more beautiful still, Anne, if\nthere had been NO separation or misunderstanding . . .  if they had come\nhand in hand all the way through life, with no memories behind them but\nthose which belonged to each other?""\n\nFor a moment Anne\'s heart fluttered queerly and for the first time her\neyes faltered under Gilbert\'s gaze and a rosy flush stained the\npaleness of her face. It was as if a veil that had hung before her\ninner consciousness had been lifted, giving to her view a revelation of\nunsuspected feelings and realities. Perhaps, after all, romance did not\ncome into one\'s life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down;\nperhaps it crept to one\'s side like an old friend through quiet ways;\nperhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of\nillumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music,\nperhaps . . .  perhaps . . . love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful\nfriendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath.\n\nThen the veil dropped again; but the Anne who walked up the dark lane\nwas not quite the same Anne who had driven gaily down it the evening\nbefore. The page of girlhood had been turned, as by an unseen finger,\nand the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery,\nits pain and gladness.\n\nGilbert wisely said nothing more; but in his silence he read the history\nof the next four years in the light of Anne\'s remembered blush. Four\nyears of earnest, happy work . . . and then the guerdon of a useful\nknowledge gained and a sweet heart won.\n\nBehind them in the garden the little stone house brooded among the\nshadows. It was lonely but not forsaken. It had not yet done with dreams\nand laughter and the joy of life; there were to be future summers for\nthe little stone house; meanwhile, it could wait. And over the river in\npurple durance the echoes bided their time.\n\n     [Note:\n\n     The correct words were obtained from the L.C.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'}","{'text': 'Who moves in with Marilla at Green Gables?', 'tokens': array(['Who', 'moves', 'in', 'with', 'Marilla', 'at', 'Green', 'Gables',

His friend Jeff works in the same place, but as a porter. Their real dream is to perform as radio comedians on the air, with their own show. Unfortunately they haven't convinced anyone about their great sense of humor yet. When they try to help the station receptionist, Anne Mason, by setting up a false audition for the position as singer, they are almost fired for their antics.\nThe station has financial problems related to their current moody singer Rita Wilson, and try to find a way to get rid of her. Their prayers are heard when Rita is shot and killed during a blackout when she is rehearsing for a broadcast.\nPolice detectives Marty Phillips and Delaney arrive at the scene, and even though they haven't found the murder weapon, they start suspecting a wannabe cowboy singer, Tex Barton, who tried to slip out the back door after the shooting. He was in the audience when Rita was rehearsing before the blackout.\nStation producer Farrell is afraid of being suspected as well, since he had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting. He asks Frankie, who overheard the discussion, to not tell the police about it. As a sign of gratitude, Farrell promises to give Anne a real audition for the position as singer, which is empty since Rita is gone.\nFrankie soon finds the weapon used to shoot Rita, hidden in a ventilator duct. It turns out the gun belongs to Tex, and has been used in a prior shooting by a woman named Gladys Wharton. When Frankie and Jeff audition for a comedy spot on air (with Frankie in blackface as a disguise), the police come looking for Tex. Later, Tex is found murdered in the office of the station owner.\nFrankie and Jeff decide to do a little investigation of their own, and search Tex's room to see if they can find anything. The only thing of interest is a picture of Anne, suggesting that her real name is Gladys. Anne is therefore suspected of the murder and arrested by the police. However, a while later she makes bail and is released.\nFrankie discovers from a radio station in Cheyenne that the shooter Gladys Wharton was a blonde woman who fell for one of her superiors and left her husband - Tex. Since Anne is a true brunette, Frankie concludes that Rita could be Gladys instead of Anne.\nWhen all the station executives are gathered in one room by the police, one of them, Van Martin, pulls out a gun and confesses to both crimes. When Jeff enters the room unannounced, he accidentally knocks the gun out of Van's hand and the police arrest him."", 'tokens': array(['Frankie', 'Ryan', 'works', 'as', 'a', 'page', 'boy', 'at', 'a',

The story concerns a two-year-old girl who drifts in a boat onto a beach in Glamorganshire in the calm before a storm. The little girl calls herself Bardie. Llewellyn is tempted to keep the girl, but decides to give her up and keeps the boat for himself. He quarters the pretty child in a simple, but well-to-do, household in his neighbourhood. As she grows up he dotes upon her so far as he can. He watches anxiously over her fortunes, partly or principally because he thinks his own may be bound up with them. It is clear from the refinement of the girl's manners, and from the fineness of her clothes she was washed ashore in, that she is no common child.\nDavy joins the crew of a ketch trading between Barnstaple and Porthcawl. Whilst in Devon, he encounters several characters who hold the key to solving the mystery of the maid of Sker. These include Sir Philip Bampfylde who spends most of his time looking for his two grandchildren who have mysteriously disappeared; Parson Chowne, a parson of demoniac wickedness and craft who works his will for many years in the north of Devon, defying God, man, and the law; and Captain Drake Bamfylde who is under suspicion of having made away with the children of his elder brother, and heirs to the family property. Old Davy gradually unravels the mystery and sets matters right, although many distractions delay him including an extended period at sea in which Blackmore gives a graphic account of the Battle of the Nile."", 'tokens': array(['The', 'Maid', 'of', 'Sker', 'is', 'set', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of',

Yet no peace there is for me among my friends\nand neighbours, unless I will set to and try--as they bid me twice a-day\nperhaps--whether I cannot tell the rights of a curious adventure which\nit pleased Providence should happen, off and on, amidst us, now for a\ngood many years, and with many ins and outs to it. They assure me, also,\nthat all good people who can read and write for ten, or it may be\ntwenty, miles around the place I live in, will buy my book--if I can\nmake it--at a higher price, perhaps, per lb., than they would give me\neven for sewin, which are the very best fish I catch: and hence\nprovision may be found for the old age and infirmities, now gaining upon\nme, every time I try to go out fishing.\n\nIn this encouragement and prospect I have little faith, knowing how much\nmore people care about what they eat than what they read. Nevertheless I\nwill hope for the best, especially as my evenings now are very long and\nwearisome; and I was counted a hopeful scholar, fifty years agone\nperhaps, in our village school here--not to mention the Royal Navy; and\nmost of all, because a very wealthy gentleman, whose name will appear in\nthis story, has promised to pay all expenses, and Â£50 down (if I do it\nwell), and to leave me the profit, if any.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the work of writing must be very dull to me,\nafter all the change of scene, and the open air and sea, and the many\nsprees ashore, and the noble fights with Frenchmen, and the power of\noaths that made me jump so in his Majesty\'s navy. God save the King, and\nQueen, and members of the Royal Family, be they as many as they\nwill--and they seem, in faith, to be manifold. But His power is equal to\nit all, if they will but try to meet Him.\n\nHowever, not to enter upon any view of politics--all of which are far\nbeyond the cleverest hand at a bait among us--I am inditing of a thing\nvery plain and simple, when you come to understand it; yet containing a\nlittle strangeness, and some wonder, here and there, and apt to move\ngood people\'s grief at the wrongs we do one another. Great part of it\nfell under mine own eyes, for a period of a score of years, or something\nthereabout. My memory still is pretty good; but if I contradict myself,\nor seem to sweep beyond my reach, or in any way to meddle with things\nwhich I had better have let alone, as a humble man and a Christian, I\npray you to lay the main fault thereof on the badness of the times, and\nthe rest upon human nature. For I have been a roving man, and may have\ngathered much of evil from contact with my fellow-men, although by\norigin meant for good. In this I take some blame to myself; for if I had\npolished my virtue well, the evil could not have stuck to it.\nNevertheless, I am, on the whole, pretty well satisfied with myself;\nhoping to be of such quality as the Lord prefers to those perfect\ncreatures with whom He has no trouble at all, and therefore no\nenjoyment.\n\nBut sometimes, taking up a book, I am pestered with a troop of doubts;\nnot only about my want of skill, and language, and experience, but\nchiefly because I never have been a man of consummate innocence,\nexcellence, and high wisdom, such as all these writers are, if we go by\ntheir own opinions.\n\nNow, when I plead among my neighbours, at the mouth of the old well, all\nthe above, my sad shortcomings, and my own strong sense of them (which\nperhaps is somewhat over-strong), they only pat me on the back, and\nsmile at one another, and make a sort of coughing noise, according to my\nbashfulness. And then if I look pleased (which for my life I cannot help\ndoing), they wink, as it were, at one another, and speak up like this:--\n\n""Now, Davy, you know better. You think yourself at least as good as any\none of us, Davy, and likely far above us all. Therefore, Davy the\nfisherman, out with all you have to say, without any French palaver.\nYou have a way of telling things so that we can see them.""\n\nWith this, and with that, and most of all with hinting about a\nFrenchman, they put me on my mettle, so that I sit upon the side-stones\nof the old-well gallery (which are something like the companion-rail of\na fore-and-after), and gather them around me, with the householders put\nforemost, according to their income, and the children listening between\ntheir legs; and thus I begin, but never end, the tale I now begin to\nyou, and perhaps shall never end it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHUNGER DRIVES HIM A-FISHING.\n\n\nIn the summer of the year 1782, I, David Llewellyn, of Newton-Nottage,\nfisherman and old sailor, was in great distress and trouble, more than I\nlike to tell you. My dear wife (a faithful partner for eight-and-twenty\nyears, in spite of a very quick temper) was lately gone to a better\nworld; and I missed her tongue and her sharp look-out at almost every\ncorner. Also my son (as fine a seaman as ever went aloft), after helping\nLord Rodney to his great victory over Grass the Frenchman, had been lost\nin a prize-ship called the Tonner, of 54 guns and 500 Crappos, which\nsank with all hands on her way home to Spithead, under Admiral Graves.\nHis young wife (who had been sent to us to see to, with his blessing) no\nsooner heard of this sad affair as in the Gazette reported, and his pay\nthat week stopped on her, but she fell into untimely travail, and was\ndead ere morning. So I buried my wife and daughter-in-law, and lost all\nchance to bury my son, between two Bridgend market-days.\n\nNow this is not very much, of course, compared with the troubles some\npeople have. But I had not been used to this matter, except in case of a\nmessmate; and so I was greatly broken down, and found my eyes so weak of\na morning, that I would not be seen out of doors, almost.\n\nThe only one now to keep a stir or sound of life in my little cottage,\nwhich faces to the churchyard, was my orphan grandchild ""Bunny,""\ndaughter of my son just drowned, and his only child that we knew of.\nBunny was a rare strong lass, five years old about then, I think; a\nstout and hearty-feeding child, able to chew every bit of her victuals,\nand mounting a fine rosy colour, and eyes as black as Archangel pitch.\n\nOne day, when I was moping there, all abroad about my bearings, and no\nbetter than water-ballasted, the while I looked at my wife\'s new broom,\nnow carrying cobweb try-sails, this little Bunny came up to me as if she\nhad a boarding-pike, and sprang into the netting hammocks of the best\nblack coat I wore.\n\n""Grand-da!"" she said, and looked to know in what way I would look at\nher; ""Grand-da, I must have sumkin more to eat.""\n\n""Something more to eat!"" I cried, almost with some astonishment, well as\nI knew her appetite; for the child had eaten a barley-loaf, and two\npig\'s feet, and a dog-fish.\n\n""Yes, more; more bexfass, grand-da."" And though she had not the words to\ntell, she put her hands in a way that showed me she ought to have more\nsolid food. I could not help looking sadly at her, proud as I was of her\nappetite. But, recovering in a minute or two, I put a good face upon it.\n\n""My dear, and you shall have more,"" I said; ""only take your feet out of\nmy pocket. Little heart have I for fishing, God knows; but a-fishing I\nwill go this day, if mother Jones will see to you.""\n\nFor I could not leave her alone quite yet, although she was a brave\nlittle maid, and no fire now was burning. But within a child\'s trot from\nmy door, and down toward the sandhills, was that famous ancient well of\nwhich I spoke just now, dedicate to St John the Baptist, where they used\nto scourge themselves. The village church stood here, they say, before\nthe inroad of the sand; and the water was counted holy. How that may be,\nI do not know; but the well is very handy. It has a little grey round\ntower of stone domed over the heart of it, to which a covered way goes\ndown, with shallow steps irregular. If it were not for this plan, the\nsand would whelm the whole of it over; even as it has overwhelmed all\nthe departure of the spring, and the cottages once surrounding it. Down\nthese steps the children go, each with a little brown pitcher, holding\nhands and groping at the sides, as they begin to feel darker. And what\nwith the sand beneath their feet, and the narrowing of the roof above,\nand the shadows moving round them, and the doubt where the water begins\nor ends (which nobody knows at any time), it is much but what some\nlittle maid tumbles in, and the rest have to pull her out again.\n\nFor this well has puzzled all the country, and all the men of great\nlearning, being as full of contrariety as a maiden courted. It comes and\ngoes, in a manner, against the coming and going of the sea, which is\nonly half a mile from it; and twice in a day it is many feet deep, and\nagain not as many inches. And the water is so crystal-clear, that down\nin the dark it is like a dream. Some people say that John the Baptist\nhad nothing to do with the making of it, because it was made before his\ntime by the ancient family of De Sandford, who once owned all the manors\nhere. In this, however, I place no faith, having read my Bible to better\npurpose than to believe that John Baptist was the sort of man to claim\nanything, least of all any water, unless he came honestly by it.\n\nIn either case, it is very pretty to see the children round the entrance\non a summer afternoon, when they are sent for water. They are all a\nlittle afraid of it, partly because of its maker\'s name, and his having\nhis head on a charger, and partly on account of its curious ways, and\nthe sand coming out of its ""nostrils"" when first it begins to flow.\n\nThat day with which I begin my story, Mrs Jones was good enough to take\ncharge of little Bunny; and after getting ready to start, I set the\nthong of our latch inside, so that none but neighbours who knew the\ntrick could enter our little cottage (or rather ""mine"" I should say\nnow); and thus with conger-rod, and prawn-net, and a long pole for the\nbass, and a junk of pressed tobacco, and a lump of barley-bread, and a\nmaybird stuffed with onions (just to refine the fishiness), away I set\nfor a long-shore day, upon as dainty a summer morn as ever shone out of\nthe heavens.\n\n""Fisherman Davy"" (as they call me all around our parts) was fifty and\ntwo years of age, I believe, that very same July, and with all my heart\nI wish that he were as young this very day. For I never have found such\ncall to enter into the affairs of another world, as to forget my\nbusiness here, or press upon Providence impatiently for a more heavenly\nstate of things. People may call me worldly-minded for cherishing such a\nview of this earth; and perhaps it is not right of me. However, I can\nput up with it, and be in no unkindly haste to say ""good-bye"" to my\nneighbours. For, to my mind, such a state of seeking, as many amongst us\ndo even boast of, is, unless in a bad cough or a perilous calenture, a\ncertain proof of curiosity displeasing to our Maker, and I might even\nsay of fickleness degrading to a true Briton.\n\nThe sun came down upon my head, so that I thought of bygone days, when I\nserved under Captain Howe, or Sir Edward Hawke, and used to stroll away\nupon leave, with half a hundred Jacks ashore, at Naples, or in Bermudas,\nor wherever the luck might happen. Now, however, was no time for me to\nthink of strolling, because I could no longer live at the expense of the\nGovernment, which is the highest luck of all, and full of noble dignity.\nThings were come to such a push that I must either work or starve; and\ncould I but recall the past, I would stroll less in the days gone by. A\npension of one and eightpence farthing for the weeks I was alive (being\nin right of a heavy wound in capture of the Bellona, Frenchman of\ntwo-and-thirty guns, by his Majesty\'s frigate Vesta, under Captain Hood)\nwas all I had to hold on by, in support of myself and Bunny, except the\nslippery fish that come and go as Providence orders them. She had sailed\nfrom Martinique, when luckily we fell in with her; and I never shall\nforget the fun, and the five hours at close quarters. We could see the\npowder on the other fellows\' faces while they were training their guns\nat us, and we showed them, with a slap, our noses, which they never\ncontrived to hit. She carried heavier metal than ours, and had sixty\nmore men to work it, and therefore we were obliged at last to capture\nher by boarding. I, like a fool, was the first that leaped into her\nmizen-chains, without looking before me, as ought to have been. The\nFrenchmen came too fast upon me, and gave me more than I bargained for.\n\nThus it happened that I fell off, in the very prime of life and\nstrength, from an able-bodied seaman and captain of the foretop to a\nsort of lurcher along shore, and a man who must get his own living with\nnets and rods and suchlike. For that very beautiful fight took place in\nthe year 1759, before I was thirty years old, and before his present\nmost gracious Majesty came to the throne of England. And inasmuch as a\nvillanous Frenchman made at me with a cutlash, and a power of blue oaths\n(taking a nasty advantage of me, while I was yet entangled), and thumped\nin three of my ribs before a kind Providence enabled me to relieve him\nof his head at a blow--I was discharged, when we came to Spithead, with\nan excellent character in a silk bag, and a considerable tightness of\nbreathing, and leave to beg my way home again.\n\nNow I had not the smallest meaning to enter into any of these\nparticulars about myself, especially as my story must be all about other\npeople--beautiful maidens, and fine young men, and several of the prime\ngentry. But as I have written it, so let it stay; because, perhaps,\nafter all, it is well that people should have some little knowledge of\nthe man they have to deal with, and learn that his character and\nposition are a long way above all attempt at deceit.\n\nTo come back once again, if you please, to that very hot day of July\n1782--whence I mean to depart no more until I have fully done with\nit--both from the state of the moon, I knew, and from the neap when my\nwife went off, that the top of the spring was likely to be in the dusk\nof that same evening. At first I had thought of going down straight\nbelow us to Newton Bay, and peddling over the Black Rocks towards the\nOgmore river, some two miles to the east of us. But the bright sun gave\nme more enterprise; and remembering how the tide would ebb, also how low\nmy pocket was, I felt myself bound in honour to Bunny to make a real\npush for it, and thoroughly search the conger-holes and the\nlobster-ledges, which are the best on all our coast, round about Pool\nTavan, and down below the old house at Sker.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE FISH ARE AS HUNGRY AS HE IS.\n\n\nTo fish at Sker had always been a matter of some risk and conflict;\ninasmuch as Evan Thomas, who lived in the ancient house there, and kept\nthe rabbit-warren, never could be brought to know that the sea did not\nbelong to him. He had a grant from the manor, he said, and the shore was\npart of the manor; and whosoever came hankering there was a poacher, a\nthief, and a robber. With these hard words, and harder blows, he kept\noff most of the neighbourhood; but I always felt that the lurch of the\ntide was no more than the heeling of a ship, and therefore that any one\nfree of the sea, was free of the ebb and flow of it.\n\nSo when he began to reproach me once, I allowed him to swear himself\nthoroughly out, and then, in a steadfast manner, said, ""Black Evan, the\nshore is not mine or yours. Stand you here and keep it, and I will never\ncome again;"" for in three hours\' time there would be a fathom of water\nwhere we stood. And when he caught me again, I answered, ""Evan Black, if\nyou catch me inland, meddling with any of your land-goods, coneys, or\nhares, or partridges, give me a leathering like a man, and I must put up\nwith it; but dare you touch me on this shore, which belongs to our lord\nthe King, all the way under high-water mark, and by the rod of the Red\nSea I will show you the law of it.""\n\nHe looked at me and the pole I bore, and, heavy and strong man as he\nwas, he thought it wiser to speak me fair. ""Well, well, Dyo, dear,"" he\nsaid in Welsh, having scarce any English, ""you have served the King,\nDyo, and are bound to know what is right and wrong; only let me know,\ngood man, if you see any other rogues fishing here.""\n\nThis I promised him freely enough, because, of course, I had no\nobjection to his forbidding other people, and especially one vile\nScotchman. Yet being a man of no liberality, he never could see even me\nfish there without following and abusing me, and most of all after a\nmarket-day.\n\nThat tide I had the rarest sport that ever you did see. Scarcely a\nconger-hole I tried without the landlord being at home, and biting\nsavagely at the iron, which came (like a rate) upon him; whereupon I had\nhim by the jaw, as the tax-collector has us. Scarcely a lobster-shelf I\nfelt, tickling as I do under the weeds, but what a grand old soldier\ncame to the portcullis of his stronghold, and nabbed the neat-hide up my\nfingers, and stuck thereto till I hauled him out ""nolus-woluss,"" as we\nsay; and there he showed his purple nippers, and his great long\nwhiskers, and then his sides, hooped like a cask, till his knuckled legs\nfought with the air, and the lobes of his tail were quivering. It was\nfine to see these fellows, worth at least a shilling, and to pop them\ninto my basket, where they clawed at one another. Glorious luck I had,\nin truth, and began to forget my troubles, and the long way home again\nto a lonely cottage, and my fear that little Bunny was passing a sorry\nday of it. She should have a new pair of boots, and mother Jones a good\nSunday dinner; and as for myself, I would think, perhaps, about half a\nglass of fine old rum (to remind me of the navy), and a pipe of the\nshort cut Bristol tobacco--but that must depend upon circumstances.\n\nNow circumstances had so much manners (contrary to their custom) that\nthey contrived to keep themselves continually in my favour. Not only did\nI fetch up and pile a noble heap of oysters and mussels just at the\nlowest of the ebb, but after that, when the tide was flowing, and my\nwork grew brisker--as it took me by the calves, and my feet were not cut\nby the mussels more than I could walk upon--suddenly I found a thing\nbeating all experience both of the past and future.\n\nThis was, that the heat of the weather, and the soft south wind\nprevailing, had filled the deep salt-water pools among the rocks of Pool\nTavan, and as far as Ffynnon wen, with the finest prawns ever seen or\ndreamed of; and also had peopled the shallow pools higher up the beach\nwith shoals of silver mullet-fry--small indeed, and as quick as\nlightning, but well worth a little trouble to catch, being as fine\neating as any lady in the land could long for.\n\nAnd here for a moment I stood in some doubt, whether first to be down on\nthe prawns or the mullet; but soon I remembered the tide would come\nfirst into the pools that held the prawns. Now it did not take me very\nlong to fill a great Holland bag with these noble fellows, rustling\ntheir whiskers, and rasping their long saws at one another. Four gallons\nI found, and a little over, when I came to measure them; and sixteen\nshillings I made of them, besides a good many which Bunny ate raw.\n\nNeither was my luck over yet, for being now in great heart and good\nfeather, what did I do but fall very briskly upon the grey mullet in the\npools: and fast as they scoured away down the shallows, fluting the\nsurface with lines of light, and huddling the ripples all up in a curve,\nas they swung themselves round on their tails with a sweep, when they\ncould swim no further--nevertheless it was all in vain, for I blocked\nthem in with a mole of kelp, weighted with heavy pebbles, and then baled\nthem out at my pleasure.\n\nNow the afternoon was wearing away, and the flood making strongly up\nchannel by the time I came back from Ffynnon wen--whither the mullet had\nled me--to my headquarters opposite Sker farmhouse, at the basin of Pool\nTavan. This pool is made by a ring of rocks sloping inward from the sea,\nand is dry altogether for two hours\' ebb and two hours\' flow of a good\nspring-tide, except so much as a little land-spring, sliding down the\nslippery sea-weed, may have power to keep it moist.\n\nA wonderful place here is for wild-fowl, the very choicest of all I\nknow, both when the sluice of the tide runs out and when it comes\nswelling back again; for as the water ebbs away with a sulky wash in the\nhollow places, and the sand runs down in little crannies, and the\nbladder-weeds hang trickling, and the limpets close their valves, and\nthe beautiful jelly-flowers look no better than chilblains,--all this\nvoid and glistening basin is at once alive with birds.\n\nFirst the seapie runs and chatters, and the turn-stone pries about with\nhis head laid sideways in a most sagacious manner, and the sanderlings\nglide in file, and the greenshanks separately. Then the shy curlews over\nthe point warily come, and leave one to watch; while the brave little\nmallard teal, with his green triangles glistening, stands on one foot in\nthe fresh-water runnel, and shakes with his quacks of enjoyment.\n\nAgain, at the freshening of the flood, when the round pool fills with\nsea (pouring in through the gate of rock), and the waves push merrily\nonward, then a mighty stir arises, and a different race of birds--those\nwhich love a swimming dinner--swoop upon Pool Tavan. Here is the giant\ngrey gull, breasting (like a cherub in church) before he dowses down his\nhead, and here the elegant kittywake, and the sullen cormorant in the\nshadow swimming; and the swiftest of swift wings, the silver-grey\nsea-swallow, dips like a butterfly and is gone; while from slumber out\nat sea, or on the pool of Kenfig, in a long wedge, cleaves the air the\nwhistling flight of wild-ducks.\n\nStanding upright for a moment, with their red toes on the water, and\ntheir strong wings flapping, in they souse with one accord and a\nstrenuous delight. Then ensues a mighty quacking of unanimous content, a\ncourteous nodding of quick heads, and a sluicing and a shovelling of\nwater over shoulder-blades, in all the glorious revelry of insatiable\nwashing.\n\nRecovering thence, they dress themselves in a sober-minded manner,\npaddling very quietly, proudly puffing out their breasts, arching their\nnecks, and preening themselves, titivating (as we call it) with their\nbills in and out the down, and shoulders up to run the wet off; then\nturning their heads, as if on a swivel, they fettle their backs and\ntheir scapular plume. Then, being as clean as clean can be, they begin\nto think of their dinners, and with stretched necks down they dive to\ncatch some luscious morsel, and all you can see is a little sharp tail\nand a pair of red feet kicking.\n\nBless all their innocent souls, how often I longed to have a good shot\nat them, and might have killed eight or ten at a time with a long gun\nheavily loaded! But all these birds knew, as well as I did, that I had\nno gun with me; and although they kept at a tidy distance, yet they let\nme look at them, which I did with great peace of mind all the time I was\neating my supper. The day had been too busy till now to stop for any\nfeeding; but now there would be twenty minutes or so ere the bass came\ninto Pool Tavan, for these like a depth of water.\n\nSo after consuming my bread and maybird, and having a good drink from\nthe spring, I happened to look at my great flag-basket, now ready to\nburst with congers and lobsters and mullet, and spider-crabs for Bunny\n(who could manage any quantity), also with other good saleable fish; and\nI could not help saying to myself, ""Come, after all now, Davy Llewellyn,\nyou are not gone so far as to want a low Scotchman to show you the place\nwhere the fish live."" And with that I lit a pipe.\n\nWhat with the hard work, and the heat, and the gentle plash of wavelets,\nand the calmness of the sunset, and the power of red onions, what did I\ndo but fall asleep as snugly as if I had been on watch in one of his\nMajesty\'s ships of the line after a heavy gale of wind? And when I woke\nup again, behold, the shadows of the rocks were over me, and the sea was\nsaluting the calves of my legs, which up to that mark were naked; and\nbut for my instinct in putting my basket up on a rock behind me, all my\nnoble catch of fish must have gone to the locker of Davy Jones.\n\nAt this my conscience smote me hard, as if I were getting old too soon;\nand with one or two of the short strong words which I had learned in the\nnavy, where the chaplain himself stirred us up with them, up I roused\nand rigged my pole for a good bout at the bass. At the butt of the ash\nwas a bar of square oak, figged in with a screw-bolt, and roven round\nthis was my line of good hemp, twisted evenly, so that if any fish came\nwho could master me, and pull me off the rocks almost, I could indulge\nhim with some slack by unreeving a fathom of line. At the end of the\npole was a strong loop-knot, through which ran the line, bearing two\nlarge hooks, with the eyes of their shanks lashed tightly with cobbler\'s\nends upon whipcord. The points of the hooks were fetched up with a file,\nand the barbs well backened, and the whole dressed over with whale-oil.\nThen upon one hook I fixed a soft crab, and on the other a cuttle-fish.\nThere were lug-worms also in my pot, but they would do better after\ndark, when a tumbling cod might be on the feed.\n\nGood-luck and bad-luck has been my lot ever since I can remember;\nsometimes a long spell of one, wing and wing, as you might say, and then\na long leg of the other. But never in all my born days did I have such a\nspell of luck in the fishing way as on that blessed 10th of July 1782.\n\nWhat to do with it all now became a puzzle, for I could not carry it\nhome all at once; and as to leaving a bit behind, or refusing to catch a\nsingle fish that wanted to be caught, neither of these was a possible\nthing to a true-born fisherman.\n\nAt last things came to such a pitch that it was difficult not to believe\nthat all must be the crowd and motion of a very pleasant dream. Here was\nthe magic ring of the pool, shaped by a dance of sea-fairies, and the\nfading light shed doubtfully upon the haze of the quivering sea, and the\nsilver water lifting like a mirror on a hinge, while the black rocks\nseemed to nod to it; and here was I pulling out big fishes almost faster\nthan I cast in.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nHE LANDS AN UNEXPECTED FISH.\n\n\nNow, as the rising sea came sliding over the coronet of rocks, as well\nas through the main entrance--for even the brim of the pool is covered\nat high water--I beheld a glorious sight, stored in my remembrance of\nthe southern regions, but not often seen at home. The day had been very\nhot and brilliant, with a light air from the south; and at sunset a haze\narose, and hung as if it were an awning over the tranquil sea. First, a\ngauze of golden colour, as the western light came through, and then a\ntissue shot with red, and now a veil of silvery softness, as the summer\nmoon grew bright.\n\nThen the quiet waves began--as their plaited lines rolled onward into\nfrills of whiteness--in the very curl and fall, to glisten with a\nflitting light. Presently, as each puny breaker overshone the one in\nfront, not the crest and comb alone, but the slope behind it, and the\ncrossing flaws inshore, gleamed with hovering radiance and soft flashes\nvanishing; till, in the deepening of the dusk, each advancing crest was\nsparkling with a mane of fire, every breaking wavelet glittered like a\nshaken seam of gold. Thence the shower of beads and lustres lapsed into\na sliding tier, moving up the sands with light, or among the pebbles\nbreaking into a cataract of gems.\n\nBeing an ancient salt, of course I was not dismayed by this show of\nphosphorus, nor even much astonished, but rather pleased to watch the\nbrightness, as it brought back to my mind thoughts of beautiful sunburnt\ndamsels whom I had led along the shore of the lovely Mediterranean. Yet\nour stupid landsmen, far and wide, were panic-struck; and hundreds fell\nupon their knees, expecting the last trump to sound. All I said to\nmyself was this: ""No wonder I had such sport to-day; change of weather\nsoon, I doubt, and perhaps a thunderstorm.""\n\nAs I gazed at all this beauty, trying not to go astray with wonder and\nwith weariness, there, in the gateway of black rock, with the offing\ndark behind her, and the glittering waves upon their golden shoulders\nbearing her--sudden as an apparition came a smoothly-gliding boat.\nBeaded all athwart the bows and down the bends with drops of light,\nholding stem well up in air, and the forefoot shedding gold, she came as\nstrait toward this poor and unconverted Davy as if an angel held the\ntiller, with an admiral in the stern-sheets.\n\nHereupon such terror seized me, after the wonders of the day, that my\npole fell downright into the water (of which a big fish wronged me so as\nto slip the hook and be off again), and it was no more than the turn of\na hair but what I had run away head over heels. For the day had been so\nmiraculous, beginning with starvation, and going on with so much heat\nand hard work and enjoyment, and such a draught of fishes, that a poor\nbody\'s wits were gone with it; and therefore I doubt not it must have\nbeen an especial decree of Providence that in turning round to run away\nI saw my big fish-basket.\n\nTo carry this over the rocks at a run was entirely impossible (although\nI was still pretty good in my legs), but to run away without it was a\ngreat deal more impossible for a man who had caught the fish himself;\nand beside the fish in the basket, there must have been more than two\nhundredweight of bass that would not go into it. Three hundred and a\nhalf in all was what I set it down at, taking no heed of prawns and\nlobsters; and with any luck in selling, it must turn two guineas.\n\nHence, perhaps, it came to pass (as much as from downright bravery, of\nwhich sometimes I have some little) that I felt myself bound to creep\nback again, under the shade of a cold wet rock, just to know what that\nboat was up to.\n\nA finer floatage I never saw, and her lines were purely elegant, and\nshe rode above the water without so much as parting it. Then, in spite\nof all my fear, I could not help admiring; and it struck me hotly at the\nheart, ""Oh, if she is but a real boat, what a craft for my business!""\nAnd with that I dropped all fear. For I had not been able, for many\nyears, to carry on my fishing as skill and knowledge warranted, only\nbecause I could not afford to buy a genuine boat of my own, and hitherto\nhad never won the chance without the money.\n\nAs yet I could see no soul on board. No one was rowing, that was\ncertain, neither any sign of a sail to give her steerage-way. However,\nshe kept her course so true that surely there must be some hand\ninvisible at the tiller. This conclusion flurried me again, very\nundesirably; and I set my right foot in such a manner as to be off in a\ntwinkling of anything unholy.\n\nBut God has care of the little souls which nobody else takes heed of;\nand so He ordained that the boat should heel, and then yaw across the\nmiddle of the pool; but for which black rocks alone would have been her\nwelcome.\n\nAt once my heart came back to me; for I saw at once, as an old sailor\npretty well up in shipwrecks, that the boat was no more than a derelict;\nand feeling that here was my chance of chances, worth perhaps ten times\nmy catch of fish, I set myself in earnest to the catching of that boat.\n\nTherefore I took up my pole again, and finding that the brace of fish\nwhom I had been over-scared to land had got away during my slackness, I\nspread the hooks, and cast them both, with the slugs of lead upon them,\nand half a fathom of spare line ready, as far as ever my arms would\nthrow.\n\nThe flight of the hooks was beyond my sight, for the phosphorus spread\nconfusion; but I heard most clearly the thump, thump of the two leaden\nbobs--the heavy and the light one--upon hollow planking. Upon this I\nstruck as I would at a fish, and the hooks got hold (or at any rate one\nof them), and I felt the light boat following faster as she began to get\nway on the haul; and so I drew her gently toward me, being still in some\nmisgiving, although resolved to go through with it.\n\nBut, bless my heart, when the light boat glided buoyantly up to my very\nfeet, and the moon shone over the starboard gunwale, and without much\ndrawback I gazed at it--behold! the little craft was laden with a\nfreight of pure innocence! All for captain, crew, and cargo, was a\nlittle helpless child. In the stern-sheets, fast asleep, with the baby\nface towards me, lay a little child in white. Something told me that it\nwas not dead, or even ailing; only adrift upon the world, and not at\nall aware of it. Quite an atom of a thing, taking God\'s will anyhow;\ncast, no doubt, according to the rocking of the boat, only with one tiny\narm put up to keep the sun away, before it fell asleep.\n\nBeing taken quite aback with pity, sorrow, and some anger (which must\nhave been of instinct), I laid hold of the bows of the skiff, and drew\nher up a narrow channel, where the land-spring found its way. The lift\nof a round wave helped her on, and the bladder-weed saved any chafing. A\nbrand-new painter (by the feel) it was that I caught hold of; but\ninstead of a hitch at the end, it had a clean sharp cut across it.\nHaving made it fast with my fishing-pole jammed hard into a crevice of\nrock, I stepped on board rather gingerly, and, seating myself on the\nforward thwart, gazed from a respectful distance at the little stranger.\n\nThe light of the moon was clear and strong, and the phosphorus of the\nsea less dazing as the night grew deeper, therefore I could see pretty\nwell; and I took a fresh plug of tobacco before any further meddling.\nFor the child was fast asleep; and, according to my experience, they are\nalways best in that way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nA LITTLE ORPHAN MERMAID.\n\n\nBy the clear moonlight I saw a very wee maiden, all in white, having\nneither cloak nor shawl, nor any other soft appliance to protect or\ncomfort her, but lying with her little back upon the aftmost planking,\nwith one arm bent (as I said before), and the other drooping at her\nside, as if the baby-hand had been at work to ease her crying; and then,\nwhen tears were tired out, had dropped in sleep or numb despair.\n\nMy feelings were so moved by this, as I became quite sure at last that\nhere was a little mortal, that the tears came to mine own eyes too, she\nlooked so purely pitiful. ""The Lord in heaven have mercy on the little\ndear!"" I cried, without another thought about it; and then I went and\nsat close by, so that she lay between my feet.\n\nHowever, she would not awake, in spite of my whistling gradually, and\nsinging a little song to her, and playing with her curls of hair;\ntherefore, as nothing can last for ever, and the tide was rising fast, I\nwas forced to give the little lady, not what you would call a kick so\nmuch as a very gentle movement of the muscles of the foot.\n\nShe opened her eyes at this, and yawned, but was much inclined to shut\nthem again; till I (having to get home that night) could make no further\nallowance for her, as having no home to go to; and upon this I got over\nall misgivings about the dirtiness of my jacket, and did what I had\nfeared to do, by reason of great respect for her; that is to say, I put\nboth hands very carefully under her, and lifted her like a delicate\nfish, and set her crosswise on my lap, and felt as if I understood her;\nand she could not have weighed more than twenty pounds, according to my\nheft of fish.\n\nHaving been touched with trouble lately, I was drawn out of all\nexperience now (for my nature is not over-soft) towards this little\nthing, so cast, in a dream almost, upon me. I thought of her mother,\nwell drowned, no doubt, and the father who must have petted her, and of\nthe many times to come when none would care to comfort her. And though a\nchild is but a child, somehow I took to that child. Therefore I became\nmost anxious as to her state of body, and handled her little mites of\nfeet, and her fingers, and all her outworks; because I was not sure at\nall that the manner of her yawning might be nothing more or less than a\ngoing out of this world almost. For think, if you can see it so, how\neverything was against her. To be adrift without any food, or any one to\ntend her, many hours, or days perhaps, with a red-hot sun or cold stars\noverhead, and the greedy sea beneath her!\n\nHowever, there she was alive, and warm, and limp, to the best of my\njudgment, sad though I was to confess to myself that I knew more of bass\nthan of babies. For it had always so pleased God that I happened to be\naway at sea when He thought fit to send them; therefore my legs went\nabroad with fear of dandling this one, that now was come, in a way to\ndisgrace a seaman; for if she should happen to get into irons, I never\ncould get her out again.\n\nUpon that matter, at any rate, I need not have concerned myself, for the\nchild was so trim and well ballasted, also ribbed so stiff and sound,\nthat any tack I set her on she would stick to it, and start no rope; and\nknowing that this was not altogether the manner of usual babies (who yaw\nabout, and no steerage-way), I felt encouraged, and capable almost of a\nwoman\'s business. Therefore I gave her a little tickle; and verily she\nbegan to laugh, or perhaps I should say by rights to smile, in a gentle\nand superior way--for she always was superior. And a funnier creature\nnever lived, neither one that could cry so distressfully.\n\n""Wake up, wake up, my deary,"" said I, ""and don\'t you be afraid of me. A\nfine little girl I\'ve got at home, about twice the size that you be, and\ngoes by the name of \'Bunny.\'""\n\n""Bunny!"" she said; and I was surprised, not being up to her qualities,\nthat she could speak so clearly. Then it struck me that if she could\ntalk like that I might as well know more about her. So I began, very\ncraftily, with the thing all children are proud about, and are generally\nsure to be up to.\n\n""Pretty little soul,"" I said, ""how old do you call yourself?""\n\nAt this she gathered up her forehead, not being used to the way I put\nit, while she was trying to think it out.\n\n""How old are you, deary?"" said I, trying hard to suck up my lips and\nchirp, as I had seen the nurses do.\n\n""I\'se two, I\'se two,"" she answered, looking with some astonishment;\n""didn\'t \'a know that? Hot\'s \'a name?""\n\nThis proof of her high standing and knowledge of the world took me for\nthe moment a good deal off my legs, until I remembered seeing it put as\na thing all must give in to, that the rising generation was beyond our\nunderstanding. So I answered, very humbly, ""Deary, my name is \'old\nDavy.\' Baby, kiss old Davy.""\n\n""I \'ill,"" she answered, briskly. ""Old Davy, I likes \'a. I\'ll be a good\ngal, I \'ill.""\n\n""A good girl! To be sure you will. Bless my heart, I never saw such a\ngirl."" And I kissed her three or four times over, until she began to\nsmell my plug, and Bunny was nobody in my eyes. ""But what\'s your own\nname, deary, now you know old Davy\'s name?""\n\n""I\'se Bardie. Didn\'t \'a know that?""\n\n""To be sure I did,"" for a little fib was needful from the way she looked\nat me, and the biggest one ever told would have been a charity under the\ncircumstances.\n\n""Pease, old Davy, I\'se aye hungy,"" she went on ere I was right again,\n""and I \'ants a dink o\' yater.""\n\n""What a fool I am!"" cried I. ""Of course you do, you darling. What an\natomy you are to talk! Stop here a moment.""\n\nSetting her on the seat by herself (like a stupid, as I was, for she\nmight have tumbled overboard), I jumped out of the boat to fetch her\nwater from the spring-head, as well as the relics of my food from the\ncorner of the fish-basket. And truly vexed was I with myself for\ndevouring of my dinner so. But no sooner was I gone, than feeling so\nleft alone again after so much desertion, what did the little thing do\nbut spring like a perfect grasshopper, and, slipping under the\nafter-thwart, set off in the bravest toddle for the very bow of the\nboat, in fear of losing sight of me? Unluckily, the boat just happened\nto lift upon a bit of a wave, and, not having won her sea-legs yet in\nspite of that long cruise, down came poor Bardie with a thump, which\nhurt me more than her, I think.\n\nKnowing what Bunny would have done, I expected a fearful roar, and back\nI ran to lift her up. But even before I could interfere, she was up\nagain and all alive, with both her arms stretched out to show, and her\nface set hard to defy herself.\n\n""I \'ont ky, I \'ont, I tell \'a. \'Ee see if I does now, and ma say hot a\ngood gal I is.""\n\n""Where did you knock yourself, little wonder? Let old Davy make it well.\nShow old Davy the poor sore place.""\n\n""Nare it is. Gardy lÃ\xa0! nare poor Bardie knock herself.""\n\nAnd she held up her short white smock, and showed me the bend of her\ndelicate round knee as simply and kindly as could be.\n\n""I \'ont ky; no, I \'ont,"" she went on, with her pretty lips screwed up.\n""Little brother ky, \'e know; but Bardie a gate big gal, savvy voo?\nBardie too big enough to ky.""\n\nHowever, all this greatness vanished when a drop of blood came oozing\nfrom the long black bruise, and still more when I tried to express my\ndeep compassion. The sense of bad-luck was too strong for the courage of\neven two years\' growth, and little Bardie proved herself of just the\nright age for crying. I had observed how clear and bright and musical\nher voice was for such a tiny creature; and now the sound of her great\nwoe, and scene of her poor helpless plight, was enough to move the rocks\ninto a sense of pity for her.\n\nHowever, while she had her cry out (as the tide would never wait), I\ntook the liberty of stowing all my fish and fishing-tackle on board of\nthat handy little boat, which I began to admire and long for more and\nmore every time I jumped from the rock into her foresheets. And finding\nhow tight and crank she was, and full of spring at every step and with a\npair of good ash sculls, and, most of all, discovering the snuggest of\nsnug lockers, my conscience (always a foremost feature) showed me in the\nstrongest light that it would be a deeply ungracious, ungrateful, and\neven sinful thing, if I failed to thank an ever wise and overruling\nProvidence for sending me this useful gift in so express a manner.\n\nAnd taking this pious and humble view of the night\'s occurrence, I soon\nperceived a special fitness in the time of its ordering. For it happened\nto be the very night when Evan Thomas was out of the way, as I had been\ntold at Nottage, and the steward of the manor safe to be as drunk as a\nfiddler at Bridgend; and it was not more than a few months since that\nenvious Scotchman, Sandy Macraw (a scurvy limb of the coastguards, who\nlived by poaching on my born rights), had set himself up with a boat,\nforsooth, on purpose to rogue me and rob me the better. No doubt he had\nstolen it somewhere, for he first appeared at night with it; and now\nhere was a boat, in all honesty mine, which would travel two feet for\neach one of his tub!\n\nBy the time I had finished these grateful reflections, and resolved to\ncontribute any unsold crabs to the Dissenting minister\'s salary (in\nrecognition of the hand of Providence, and what he had taught me\nconcerning it no longer ago than last Sabbath-day, when he said that the\nLord would make up to me for the loss of my poor wife, though never\ndreaming, I must confess, of anything half so good as a boat), and by\nthe time that I had moored this special mercy snugly, and hidden the\noars, so that no vile wrecker could make off with her feloniously, that\ndear little child was grown quiet again, being unable to cry any more,\nand now beginning to watch my doings as much as I could wish, or more.\n\nShe never seemed tired of watching me, having slept out all her sleep\nfor the moment; and as I piled up fish on fish, and they came sliding,\nslippery, she came shyly, eyeing them with a desire to see each one,\npushing her mites of fingers out, and then drawing back in a hurry as\ntheir bellies shone in the moonlight. Some of the congers could wriggle\nstill, and they made her scream when they did it; but the lobsters were\nher chief delight, being all alive and kicking. She came and touched\nthem reverently, and ready to run if they took it amiss; and then she\nstroked their whiskers, crying, ""Pitty, pitty! jolly, jolly!"" till one\ngreat fellow, who knew no better, would have nipped her wrist asunder if\nI had not ricked his claw.\n\n""Now, deary,"" said I, as I drew her away, ""you have brought poor old\nDavy a beautiful boat, and the least that he can do for you is to get\nyou a good supper."" For since her tumble the little soul had seemed\nneither hungry nor thirsty.\n\n""Pease, old Davy,"" she answered, ""I \'ants to go to mama and papa, and\nickle bother and Susan.""\n\n""The devil you do!"" thought I, in a whistle, not seeing my way to a fib\nas yet.\n\n""Does \'ee know mama and papa, and ickle bother, old Davy?""\n\n""To be sure I do, my deary--better than I know you, almost.""\n\n""\'Et me go to them, \'et me go to them. Hot ma say about my poor leggy\npeggy?""\n\nThis was more than I could tell; believing her mother to be, no doubt,\nsome thirty fathoms under water, and her father and little brother in\nabout the same predicament.\n\n""Come along, my little dear, and I\'ll take you to your mother."" This was\nwhat I said, not being ready, as yet, with a corker.\n\n""I\'se yeady, old Davy,"" she answered; ""I\'se kite yeady. \'Hen \'ll \'e be\nyeady? Peshy voo.""\n\n""Ready and steady: word of command! march!"" said I, looking up at the\nmoon, to try to help me out of it. But the only thing that I could find\nto help me in this trouble was to push about and stir, and keep her\nlooking at me. She was never tired of looking at things with life or\nmotion in them; and this I found the special business of her nature\nafterwards.\n\nNow, being sure of my boat, I began to think what to do with Bardie. And\nmany foolish ideas came, but I saw no way to a wise one, or at least I\nthought so then, and unhappily looked to prudence more than to gracious\nProvidence, for which I have often grieved bitterly, ever since it\nturned out who Bardie was.\n\nFor the present, however (though strongly smitten with her manners,\nappearance, and state of shipwreck, as well as impressed with a general\nsense of her being meant for good-luck to me), I could not see my way to\ntake her to my home and support her. Many and many times over I said to\nmyself, in my doubt and uneasiness, and perhaps more times than need\nhave been if my conscience had joined me, that it was no good to be a\nfool, to give way (as a woman might do) to the sudden affair of the\nmoment, and a hot-hearted mode of regarding it. And the harder I worked\nat the stowing of fish, the clearer my duty appeared to me.\n\nSo by the time that all was ready for starting with this boat of mine,\nthe sea being all the while as pretty as a pond by candle-light, it was\nsettled in my mind what to do with Bardie. She must go to the old\nSker-house. And having taken a special liking (through the goodness of\nmy nature and the late distress upon me) to this little helpless thing,\nmost sincerely I prayed to God that all might be ordered for the best;\nas indeed it always is, if we leave it to Him.\n\nNevertheless I ought never to have left it to Him, as every one now\nacknowledges. But how could I tell?\n\nBy this time she began to be overcome with circumstances, as might\nhappen naturally to a child but two years old, after long exposure\nwithout any food or management. Scared, and strange, and tired out, she\nfell down anyhow in the boat, and lay like a log, and frightened me.\nMany men would have cared no more, but, taking the baby for dead, have\ndropped her into the grave of the waters. I, however, have always been\nof a very different stamp from these; and all the wars, and discipline,\nand doctrine I have encountered, never could imbue me with the cruelty\nof my betters. Therefore I was shocked at thinking that the little dear\nwas dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nFINDS A HOME OF SOME SORT.\n\n\nHowever, it was high time now, if we had any hope at all of getting into\nSker-house that night, to be up and moving. For though Evan Thomas might\nbe late, Moxy, his wife, would be early; and the door would open to none\nbut the master after the boys were gone to bed. For the house is very\nlonely; and people no longer innocent as they used to be in that\nneighbourhood.\n\nI found the child quite warm and nice, though overwhelmed with weight of\nsleep; and setting her crosswise on my shoulders, whence she slid down\ninto my bosom, over the rocks I picked my way, by the light of the full\nclear moon, towards the old Sker-Grange, which stands a little back\nfrom the ridge of beach, and on the edge of the sandhills.\n\nThis always was, and always must be, a very sad and lonesome place,\nclose to a desolate waste of sand, and the continual roaring of the sea\nupon black rocks. A great grey house, with many chimneys, many gables,\nand many windows, yet not a neighbour to look out on, not a tree to feed\nits chimneys, scarce a firelight in its gables in the very depth of\nwinter. Of course, it is said to be haunted; and though I believe not\naltogether in any stories of that kind--despite some very strange things\nindeed which I have beheld at sea--at any rate, I would rather not hear\nany yarns on that matter just before bedtime in that house; and most\npeople would agree with me, unless I am much mistaken.\n\nFor the whole neighbourhood--if so you may call it, where there are no\nneighbours--is a very queer one--stormy, wild, and desolate, with little\nmore than rocks and sand and sea to make one\'s choice among. As to the\nsea, not only dull, and void it is of any haven, or of proper traffic,\nbut as dangerous as need be, even in good weather, being full of\ndraughts and currents, with a tide like a mill-race, suffering also the\nups and downs which must be where the Atlantic Ocean jostles with blind\nnarrowings: it offers, moreover, a special peril (a treacherous and a\nshifty one) in the shape of some horrible quicksands, known as the\n""Sker-Weathers:"" these at the will of storm and current change about\nfrom place to place, but are, for the most part, some two miles from\nshore, and from two to four miles long, according to circumstances;\nsometimes almost bare at half-tide, and sometimes covered at low water.\nIf any ship falls into them, the bravest skipper that ever stood upon a\nquarter-deck can do no more than pipe to prayers, though one or two\ncraft have escaped when the tide was rising rapidly.\n\nAs for the shore, it is no better (when once you get beyond the rocks)\nthan a stretch of sandhills, with a breadth of flaggy marsh behind them\nall the way to the mouth of Neath river, some three leagues to the\nwestward. Eastward, the scene is fairer inland, but the coast itself\nmore rugged and steep, and scarcely more inhabited, having no house\nnearer than Rhwychyns, which is only a small farm, nearly two miles from\nSker-Grange, and a mile from any other house. And if you strike inland\nfrom Sker--that is to say, to the northward--there is nothing to see but\nsand, warren, and furze, and great fields marked with rubble, even as\nfar as Kenfig.\n\nLooking at that vast lonely house, there were two things I never could\nmake out. The first was, who could ever have been mad enough to build it\nthere?--for it must have cost a mint of money, being all of quarried and\ncarried stone, and with no rich farm to require it. And the second thing\nwas still worse a puzzle: how could any one ever live there?\n\nAs to the first point, the story is, that the house was built by abbots\nof Neath, when owners of Sker-manor, adding to it, very likely, as they\nfollowed one another; and then it was used as their manor-court, and for\npurposes more important, as a place of refection, being near good\nfisheries, and especially Kenfig Pool, stocked with all fresh-water\nfish, and every kind of wild-fowl.\n\nBut upon the other question all that I can say is this: I have knocked\nabout the world a good bit, and have suffered many trials, by the which\nI am, no doubt, chastened and highly rectified; nevertheless, I would\nrather end my life among the tomb-stones, if only allowed three\nfarthings\' worth of tobacco every day, than live with all those abbots\'\nluxuries in that old grey house.\n\nHowever, there were no abbots now, nor any sort of luxury, only a rough\nunpleasant farmer, a kind but slovenly wife of his, and five great lads,\nnotorious for pleasing no one except themselves; also a boy of a\ndifferent order, as you soon shall see.\n\nThinking of all this, I looked with tenderness at the little dear,\nfallen back so fast asleep, innocent, and trustful, with her head upon\nmy shoulder, and her breathing in my beard. Turning away at view of the\nhouse, I brought the moonlight on her face, and this appeared so pure,\nand calm, and fit for better company, that a pain went to my heart, as\nin Welsh we speak of it.\n\nBecause she was so fast asleep, and that alone is something holy in a\nvery little child; so much it seems to be the shadow of the death\nitself, in their pausing fluttering lives, in their want of wit for\ndreaming, and their fitness for a world of which they must know more\nthan this; also to a man who feels the loss of much believing, and what\ngrievous gain it is to make doubt of everything, such a simple trust in\nHim, than whom we find no better father, such a confidence of safety at\nthe very outset seems a happy art unknown, and tempts him back to\nignorance. Well aware what years must bring, from all the ill they have\nbrought to us, we cannot watch this simple sort without a sadness on our\nside, a pity, and a longing, as for something lost and gone.\n\nIn the scoop between two sandhills such a power of moonlight fell upon\nthe face of this baby, that it only wanted the accident of her lifting\nbright eyes to me to make me cast away all prudence, and even the dread\nof Bunny. But a man at my time of life must really look to the main\nchance first, and scout all romantic visions; and another face means\nanother mouth, however pretty it may be. Moreover, I had no wife now,\nnor woman to look after us; and what can even a man-child do, without\ntheir apparatus? While on the other hand I knew that (however dreary\nSker might be) there was one motherly heart inside it. Therefore it came\nto pass that soon the shadow of that dark house fell upon the little one\nin my arms, while with a rotten piece of timber, which was lying handy,\nI thumped and thumped at the old oak door, but nobody came to answer me;\nnobody even seemed to hear, though every knock went further and further\ninto the emptiness of the place.\n\nBut just as I had made up my mind to lift the latch, and to walk in\nfreely, as I would have done in most other houses, but stood upon\nscruple with Evan Thomas, I heard a slow step in the distance, and Moxy\nThomas appeared at last--a kindly-hearted and pleasant woman, but apt to\nbe low-spirited (as was natural for Evan\'s wife), and not very much of a\nmanager. And yet it seems hard to blame her there, when I come to think\nof it, for most of the women are but so, round about our\nneighbourhood--sanding up of room and passage, and forming patterns on\nthe floor every other Saturday, and yet the roof all frayed with\ncobwebs, and the corners such as, in the navy, we should have been\nrope-ended for.\n\nBy means of nature, Moxy was shaped for a thoroughly good and lively\nwoman; and such no doubt she would have been, if she had had the luck to\nmarry me, as at one time was our signification. God, however, ordered\nthings in a different manner, and no doubt He was considering what might\nbe most for my benefit. Nevertheless, in the ancient days, when I was a\nfine young tar on leave, and all Sunday-school set caps at me (perhaps I\nwas two-and-twenty then), the only girl I would allow to sit on the\ncrossing of my legs, upon a well-dusted tombstone, and suck the things I\ncarried for them (all being fond of peppermint), was this little Moxy\nStradling, of good Newton family, and twelve years old at that time. She\nmade me swear on the blade of my knife never to have any one but her;\nand really I looked forward to it as almost beyond a joke; and her\nfather had some money.\n\n""Who\'s there at this time of night?"" cried Moxy Thomas, sharply, and in\nWelsh of course, although she had some English; ""pull the latch, if you\nbe honest. Evan Black is in the house.""\n\nBy the tone of her voice I knew that this last was a fib of fright, and\nglad I was to know it so. Much the better chance was left me of\ndisposing Bardie somewhere, where she might be comfortable.\n\nSoon as Mrs Thomas saw us by the light of a home-made dip, she scarcely\nstopped to stare before she wanted the child out of my arms, and was\nready to devour it, guessing that it came from sea, and talking all the\nwhile, full gallop, as women find the way to do. I was expecting fifty\nquestions, and, no doubt, she asked them, yet seemed to answer them all\nherself, and be vexed with me for talking, yet to want me to go on.\n\n""Moxy, now be quick,"" I said; ""this little thing from out the sea----""\n\n""Quick is it? Quick indeed! Much quick you are, old Dyo!"" she replied in\nEnglish. ""The darling dear, the pretty love!"" for the child had spread\nits hands to her, being taken with a woman\'s dress. ""Give her to me,\nclumsy Davy. Is it that way you do carry her?""\n\n""Old Davy tarry me aye nicely, I tell \'a. Old Davy good and kind; and I\n\'ont have him called kumsy.""\n\nSo spake up my two-year-old, astonishing me (as she always has done) by\nher wonderful cleverness, and surprising Moxy Thomas that such clear\ngood words should come from so small a creature.\n\n""My goodness me! you little vixen! wherever did you come from? Bring her\nin yourself, then, Dyo, if she thinks so much of you. Let me feel her.\nNot wet she is. Where-ever did you get her? Put her on this little\nstool, and let her warm them mites of feet till I go for bread and\nbutter.""\n\nAlthough the weather was so hot, a fire of coal and driftwood was\nburning in the great chimney-place, for cooking of black Evan\'s supper;\nbecause he was an outrageous man to eat, whenever he was drunk, which\n(as a doctor told me once) shows the finest of all constitutions.\n\nBut truly there was nothing else of life, or cheer, or comfort, in the\ngreat sad stony room. A floor of stone, six gloomy doorways, and a\nblack-beamed ceiling--no wonder that my little darling cowered back into\nmy arms, and put both hands before her eyes.\n\n""No, no, no!"" she said. ""Bardie doesn\'t \'ike it. When mama come, she be\nvery angy with \'a, old Davy.""\n\nI felt myself bound to do exactly as Mrs Thomas ordered me, and so I\ncarried Miss Finical to the three-legged stool of firwood which had been\npointed out to me; and having a crick in my back for a moment after\nbearing her so far, down I set her upon her own legs, which, although so\nneat and pretty, were uncommonly steadfast. To my astonishment, off she\nstarted (before I could fetch myself to think) over the rough stone\nflags of the hall, trotting on her toes entirely, for the very life of\nher. Before I could guess what she was up to, she had pounced upon an\nold kitchen-towel, newly washed, but full of splinters, hanging on a\nthree-legged horse, and back she ran in triumph with it--for none could\nsay that she toddled--and with a want of breath, and yet a vigour that\nmade up for it, began to rub with all her power, as well as a highly\nskilful turn, the top of that blessed three-legged stool, and some way\ndown the sides of it.\n\n""What\'s the matter, my dear?"" I asked, almost losing my mind at this,\nafter all her other wonders.\n\n""Dirt,"" she replied; ""degustin\' dirt!"" never stopping to look up at me.\n\n""What odds for a little dirt, when a little soul is hungry?""\n\n""Bardie a boofley kean gal, and this \'tool degustin\' cochong!"" was all\nthe reply she vouchsafed me; but I saw that she thought less of me.\nHowever, I was glad enough that Moxy did not hear her, for Mrs Thomas\nhad no unreasonable ill-will towards dirt, but rather liked it in its\nplace; and with her its place was everywhere. But I, being used to see\nevery cranny searched and scoured with holy-stone, blest, moreover, when\nashore, with a wife like Amphitrite (who used to come aboard of us),\ncould thoroughly enter into the cleanliness of this Bardie, and thought\nmore of her accordingly.\n\nWhile this little trot was working, in the purest ignorance of father\nand of mother, yet perhaps in her tiny mind hoping to have pleased them\nboth, back came Mrs Thomas, bringing all the best she had of comfort and\nof cheer for us, although not much to speak of.\n\nI took a little hollands hot, on purpose to oblige her, because she had\nno rum; and the little baby had some milk and rabbit-gravy, being set up\nin a blanket, and made the most we could make of her. And she ate a\ntruly beautiful supper, sitting gravely on the stool, and putting both\nhands to her mouth in fear of losing anything. All the boys were gone\nto bed after a long day\'s rabbiting, and Evan Black still on the spree;\nso that I was very pleasant (knowing my boat to be quite safe) toward my\nancient sweetheart. And we got upon the old times so much, in a\npleasing, innocent, teasing way, that but for fear of that vile black\nEvan we might have forgotten poor Bardie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nBOAT _VERSUS_ BARDIE.\n\n\nGlad as I was, for the poor child\'s sake, that Black Evan happened to be\nfrom home, I had perhaps some reason also to rejoice on my own account.\nFor if anything of any kind could ever be foretold about that most\nuncertain fellow\'s conduct, it was that when in his cups he would\nfight--with cause, if he could find any; otherwise, without it.\n\nAnd in the present case, perhaps, was some little cause for fighting;\ntouching (as he no doubt would think) not only his marital but manorial\nrights of plunder. Of course, between Moxy and myself all was purely\nharmless, each being thankful to have no more than a pleasant eye for\nthe other; and of course, in really serious ways, I had done no harm to\nhim; that boat never being his, except by downright piracy. Nevertheless\nfew men there are who look at things from what I may call a large and\nopen standing-place; and Evan might even go so far as to think that I\ndid him a double wrong, in taking that which was his, the boat, and\nleaving that which should have been mine--to wit, the little maiden--as\na helpless burden upon his hands, without so much as a change of\nclothes; and all this after a great day\'s sport among his rocks, without\nhis permission!\n\nFeeling how hopeless it would be to reason these matters out with him,\nespecially as he was sure to be drunk, I was glad enough to say\n""Good-night"" to my new young pet, now fast asleep, and to slip off\nquietly to sea with my little frigate and its freight, indulging also my\nnatural pride at being, for the first time in my life, a legitimate\nshipowner and independent deep-sea fisherman. By this time the tide was\nturned, of course, and running strong against me as I laid her head for\nNewton Bay by the light of the full moon; and proud I was, without\nmistake, to find how fast I could send my little crank barky against the\ncurrent, having being a fine oarsman in my day, and always stroke of the\ncaptain\'s gig.\n\nBut as one who was well acquainted with the great dearth of honesty (not\nin our own parish only, but for many miles around), I could not see my\nway to the public ownership of this boat, without a deal of trouble and\nvexation. Happening so that I did not buy it, being thoroughly void of\nmoney (which was too notorious, especially after two funerals conducted\nto everybody\'s satisfaction), big rogues would declare at once, judging\nme by themselves, perhaps, that I had been and stolen it. And likely\nenough, to the back of this, they would lay me half-a-dozen murders and\na wholesale piracy.\n\nNow I have by nature the very strongest affection for truth that can be\nreconciled with a good man\'s love of reason. But sometimes it happens so\nthat we must do violence to ourselves for the sake of our\nfellow-creatures. If these, upon occasion offered, are only too sure to\nturn away and reject the truth with a strong disgust, surely it is dead\nagainst the high and pure duty we owe them, to saddle them with such a\nheavy and deep responsibility. And to take still loftier views of the\ncharity and kindness needful towards our fellow-beings--when they hanker\nfor a thing, as they do nearly always for a lie, and have set their\nhearts upon it, how selfish it must be, and inhuman, not to let them\nhave it! Otherwise, like a female in a delicate condition, to what\nextent of injury may we not expose them? Now sailors have a way of\ntelling great facts of imagination in the most straightforward and\nsimple manner, being so convinced themselves that they care not a rope\'s\nend who besides is convinced, and who is not. And to make other people\nbelieve, the way is not to want them to do it; only the man must himself\nbelieve, and be above all reasoning.\n\nAnd I was beginning to believe more and more as I went on, and the\nimportance of it grew clearer, all about that ill-fated ship of which I\nhad been thinking ever since the boat came in. Twelve years ago, as\nnearly as need be, and in the height of summer--namely, on the 3d of\nJune 1770--a large ship called the \'Planter\'s Welvard,\' bound from\nSurinam to the Port of Amsterdam, had been lost and swallowed up near\nthis very dangerous place. Three poor children of the planter (whose\nname was J. S. Jackert), on their way home to be educated, had floated\nashore, or at least their bodies, and are now in Newton churchyard. The\nsame must have been the fate of Bardie but for the accident of that\nboat. And though she was not a Dutchman\'s child, so far as one could\nguess, from her wonderful power of English, and no sign of Dutch build\nabout her, she might very well have been in a Dutch ship with her father\nand mother, and little brother and Susan, in the best cabin. It was well\nknown among us that Dutch vessels lay generally northward of their true\ncourse, and from the likeness of the soundings often came up the Bristol\ninstead of the English Channel; and that this mistake (which the set of\nthe stream would increase) generally proved fatal to them in the absence\nof any lighthouse.\n\nThat some ship or other had been lost, was to my mind out of all\ndispute, although the weather had been so lovely; but why it must have\nbeen a Dutch rather than an English ship, and why I need so very plainly\nhave seen the whole of it myself (as by this time I began to believe\nthat I had done), is almost more than I can tell, except that I hoped it\nmight be so, as giving me more thorough warrant in the possession of my\nprize. This boat, moreover, seemed to be of foreign build, so far as I\ncould judge of it by moonlight: but of that hereafter.\n\nThe wonder is that I could judge of anything at all, I think, after the\nlong and hard day\'s work, for a man not so young as he used to be. And\nrocks are most confusing things to be among for a length of time, and\naway from one\'s fellow-creatures, and nothing substantial on the\nstomach. They do so darken and jag and quiver, and hang over heavily as\na man wanders under them, with never a man to speak to; and then the\nsands have such a way of shaking, and of shivering, and changing colour\nbeneath the foot, and shining in and out with patterns coming all astray\nto you! When to these contrary vagaries you begin to add the loose\nunprincipled curve of waves, and the up and down of light around you,\nand to and fro of sea-breezes, and startling noise of sea-fowl, and a\nworld of other confusions, with roar of the deep confounding them--it\nbecomes a bitter point to judge a man of what he saw, and what he thinks\nhe must have seen.\n\nIt is beneath me to go on with what might seem excuses. Enough that I\nfelt myself in the right; and what more can any man do, if you please,\nhowever perfect he may be? Therefore I stowed away my boat (well earned\nboth by mind and body) snugly enough to defy, for the present, even the\nsharp eyes of Sandy Macraw, under Newton Point, where no one ever went\nbut myself. Some of my fish I put to freshen in a solid mass of\nbladder-weed, and some I took home for the morning, and a stroke of\nbusiness after church. And if any man in the world deserved a downright\npiece of good rest that night, with weary limbs and soft conscience, you\nwill own it was Davy Llewellyn.\n\nSunday morning I lay abed, with Bunny tugging very hard to get me up for\nbreakfast, until it was almost eight o\'clock, and my grandchild in a\nbitter strait of hunger for the things she smelled. After satisfying\nher, and scoring at the ""Jolly Sailors"" three fine bass against my shot,\nwhat did I do but go to church with all my topmost togs on? And that not\nfrom respect alone for the parson, who was a customer, nor even that\nColonel Lougher of Candleston Court might see me, and feel inclined to\ndischarge me as an exemplary Churchman (when next brought up before\nhim). These things weighed with me a little, it is useless to deny; but\nmy main desire was that the parish should see me there, and know that I\nwas not abroad on a long-shore expedition, but was ready to hold up my\nhead on a Sunday with the best of them, as I always had done.\n\nAt one time, while I ate my breakfast, I had some idea perhaps that it\nwould be more pious almost, and create a stronger belief in me, as well\nas ease my own penitence with more relief of groaning, if I were to\nappear in the chapel of the Primitive Christians, after certain fish\nwere gutted. But partly the fear of their singing noise (unsuitable to\nmy head that morning after the Hollands at Sker-house), and partly my\nsense that after all it was but forecastle work there, while the church\nwas quarter-deck, and most of all the circumstance that no magistrate\never went there, led me, on the whole, to give the preference to the old\nconcern, supported so bravely by royalty. Accordingly to church I went,\nand did a tidy stroke of business, both before and after service, in the\nway of lobsters.\n\nWe made a beautiful dinner that day, Bunny and I, and mother Jones, who\nwas good enough to join us; and after slipping down to see how my boat\nlay for the tide, and finding her as right as could be, it came into my\nhead that haply it would be a nice attention, as well as ease my mind\nupon some things that were running in it, if only I could pluck up\nspirit to defy the heat of the day, and challenge my own weariness by\nwalking over to Sker-Manor. For of course the whole of Monday, and\nperhaps of Tuesday too, and even some part of Wednesday (with people not\ntoo particular), must be occupied in selling my great catch of Saturday:\nso I resolved to go and see how the little visitor was getting on, and\nto talk with her. For though, in her weariness and wandering of the\nnight before, she did not seem to remember much, as was natural at her\ntender age, who could tell what might have come to her memory by this\ntime, especially as she was so clever? And it might be a somewhat\nawkward thing if the adventures which I felt really must have befallen\nher should happen to be contradicted by her own remembrance: for all I\nwanted was the truth; and if her truths contradicted mine, why, mine\nmust be squared off to meet them; for great is truth, and shall prevail.\n\nI thought it as well to take Bunny with me, for children have a\nremarkable knack of talking to one another, which they will not use to\ngrown people; also the walk across the sands is an excellent thing for\nyoung legs, we say, being apt to crack the skin a little, and so\nenabling them to grow. A strong and hearty child was Bunny, fit to be\nrated A.B., almost, as behoved a fine sailor\'s daughter. And as proud as\nyou could wish to see, and never willing to give in; so I promised\nmyself some little sport in watching our Bunny\'s weariness, as the sand\ngrew deeper, and yet her pride to the last declaring that I should not\ncarry her.\n\nBut here I reckoned quite amiss, for the power of the heat was\nsuch--being the very hottest day I ever knew out of the tropics, and the\ngreat ridge of sandhills shutting us off from any sight of the\nwater--that my little grandchild scarcely plodded a mile ere I had to\ncarry her. And this was such a heavy job among the deep dry mounds of\nsand, that for a time I repented much of the over-caution which had\nstopped me from using my beautiful new boat at once, to paddle down with\nthe ebb to Sker, and come home gently afterwards with the flow of the\ntide towards evening. Nevertheless, as matters proved, it was wiser to\nrisk the broiling.\n\nThis heat was not of the sun alone (such as we get any summer\'s day, and\nsuch as we had yesterday), but thickened heat from the clouds\nthemselves, shedding it down like a burning-glass, and weltering all\nover us. It was, though I scarcely knew it then, the summing-up and\ncrowning period of whole weeks of heat and drought, and indeed of the\nhottest summer known for at least a generation. And in the hollows of\nyellow sand, without a breath of air to stir, or a drop of moisture, or\na firm place for the foot, but a red and fiery haze to go through, it\nwas all a man could do to keep himself from staggering.\n\nHence it was close upon three o\'clock, by the place the sun was in, when\nBunny and I came in sight of Sker-house, and hoped to find some water\nthere. Beer, of course, I would rather have; but never was there a\nchance of that within reach of Evan Thomas. And I tried to think this\nall the better; for half a gallon would not have gone any distance with\nme, after ploughing so long through sand, with the heavy weight of\nBunny, upon a day like that. Only I hoped that my dear little grandchild\nmight find something fit for her, and such as to set her up again; for\nnever before had I seen her, high and strong as her spirit was, so\novercome by the power and pressure of the air above us. She lay in my\narms almost as helpless as little Bardie, three years younger, had lain\nthe night before; and knowing how children will go off without a man\'s\nexpecting it, I was very uneasy, though aware of her constitution. So in\nthe heat I chirped and whistled, though ready to drop myself almost; and\ncoming in sight of the house, I tried my best to set her up again,\nfinding half of her clothes gone down her back, and a great part of her\nfat legs somehow sinking into her Sunday shoes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nCHILDREN WILL BE CHILDREN.\n\n\nThe ""boys of Sker,"" as we always called those rough fellows over at\nNewton, were rabbiting in the warren; according to their usual practice,\non a Sunday afternoon. A loose unseemly lot of lads, from fifteen up to\ntwo-and-twenty years of age, perhaps, and very little to choose between\nthem as to work and character. All, however, were known to be first-rate\nhands at any kind of sporting, or of poaching, or of any roving\npleasure.\n\nWatkin, the sixth and youngest boy, was of a different nature. His\nbrothers always cast him off, and treated him with a high contempt, yet\nnever could despise him. In their rough way, they could hardly help a\nsulky sort of love for him.\n\nThe seventh and last child had been a girl--a sweet little creature as\ncould be seen, and taking after Watkin. But she had something on her\nthroat from six months up to six years old; and when she died, some\nthree months back, people who had been in the house said that her mother\nwould sooner have lost all the boys put together, if you left Watkin out\nof them. How that was I cannot say, and prefer to avoid those subjects.\nBut I know that poor black Evan swore no oath worth speaking of for one\ngreat market and two small ones, but seemed brought down to sit by\nhimself, drinking quietly all day long.\n\nWhen we came to the ancient hall (or kitchen, as now they called it),\nfor a moment I was vexed--expecting more of a rush, perhaps, than I was\nentitled to. Knowing how much that young child owed me for her\npreservation, and feeling how fond I was of her, what did I look for but\nwild delight at seeing ""old Davy"" back again? However, it seems, she had\ntaken up with another and forgotten me.\n\nWatkin, the youngest boy of Sker, was an innocent good little fellow,\nabout twelve years old at that time. Bardie had found this out already;\nas quickly as she found out my goodness, even by the moonlight. She had\ntaken the lead upon Watkin, and was laying down the law to him, upon a\nquestion of deep importance, about the manner of dancing. I could dance\na hornpipe with anybody, and forward I came to listen.\n\n""No, no, no! I tell \'a. \'E mustn\'t do like that, Yatkin. \'E must go\nyound and yound like this; and \'e must hold \'a cothes out, same as I\ndoes. Gardy lÃ\xa0! \'E must hold \'a cothes out all the time, \'e must.""\n\nThe little atom, all the time she delivered these injunctions, was\nholding out her tiny frock in the daintiest manner, and tripping\nsideways here and there, and turning round quite upon tiptoe, with her\nchildish figure poised, and her chin thrown forward; and then she would\ngive a good hard jump, but all to the tune of the brass jew\'s-harp which\nthe boy was playing for his very life. And all the while she was doing\nthis, the amount of energy and expression in her face was wonderful. You\nwould have thought there was nothing else in all the world that required\ndoing with such zeal and abandonment. Presently the boy stopped for a\nmoment, and she came and took the knee of his trousers, and put it to\nher pretty lips with the most ardent gratitude.\n\n""She must be a foreigner,"" said I to myself: ""no British child could\ndance like that, and talk so; and no British child ever shows\ngratitude.""\n\nAs they had not espied us yet, where we stood in the passage-corner, I\ndrew Bunny backward, and found her all of a tremble with eagerness to go\nand help.\n\n""More pay,"" said little missy, with a coaxing look; ""more pay, Yatkin!""\n\n""No, no. You must say \'more play, please, Watkin.\'""\n\n""See voo pay, Yatkin; I \'ants--more pay!"" The funny thing laughed at\nherself while saying it, as if with some comic inner sense of her own\ninsatiability in the matter of play.\n\n""But how do you expect me to play the music,"" asked Watkin, very\nreasonably, ""if I am to hold my clothes out all the time?""\n\n""Can\'t \'a?"" she replied, looking up at him with the deepest\ndisappointment; ""can\'t \'a pay and dance too, Yatkin? I thought \'a could\ndo anything. I \'ants to go to my dear mama and papa and ickle bother.""\n\nHere she began to set up a very lamentable cry, and Watkin in vain tried\nto comfort her, till, hearing us, she broke from him.\n\n""Nare\'s my dear mama, nare\'s my dear mama coming!"" she exclaimed, as she\ntrotted full speed to the door. ""Mama! mama! here I is. And \'e mustn\'t\nscold poor Susan.""\n\nIt is out of my power to describe how her little flushed countenance\nfell when she saw only me and Bunny. She drew back suddenly, with the\nbrightness fading out of her eager eyes, and the tears that were in them\nbegan to roll, and her bits of hands went up to her forehead, as if she\nhad lost herself, and the corners of her mouth came down; and then with\na sob she turned away, and with quivering shoulders hid herself. I\nscarcely knew what to do for the best; but our Bunny was very good to\nher, even better than could have been hoped, although she came of a\nkindly race. Without standing upon ceremony, as many children would have\ndone, up she ran to the motherless stranger, and, kneeling down on the\nfloor, contrived to make her turn and look at her. Then Bunny pulled out\nher new handkerchief, of which she was proud, I can tell you, being the\nfirst she had ever owned, made from the soundest corner of mother\nJones\'s old window-blind, and only allowed with a Sunday frock; and\nalthough she had too much respect for this to wet it with anything\nherself, she never for a moment grudged to wipe poor Bardie\'s eyes with\nit. Nay, she even permitted her--which was much more for a child to\ndo--to take it into her own two hands and rub away at her eyes with it.\n\nGradually she coaxed her out of the cupboard of her refuge, and sitting\nin some posture known to none but women children, without a stool to\nhelp her, she got the little one on her lap, and stroked at her, and\nmurmured to her, as if she had found a favourite doll in the depth of\ntrouble. Upon the whole, I was so pleased that I vowed to myself I would\ngive my Bunny the very brightest halfpenny I should earn upon the\nmorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, the baby of higher birth--as a glance was enough to show\nher--began to relax and come down a little, both from her dignity and\nher woe. She looked at Bunny with a gleam of humour, to which her wet\neyes gave effect.\n\n""\'E call that a ponkey-hankerchy? Does \'a call that a ponkey-hankerchy?""\n\nBunny was so overpowered by this, after all that she had done, and at\nthe air of pity wherewith her proud ornament was flung on the floor,\nthat she could only look at me as if I had cheated her about it. And\ntruly I had seen no need to tell her about mother Jones and her blind.\nThen these little ones got up, having sense of a natural discordance of\nrank between them, and Bunny no longer wiped the eyes of Bardie, nor\nBardie wept in the arms of Bunny. They put their little hands behind\nthem, and stood apart to think a bit, and watched each other shyly. To\nsee them move their mouths and fingers, and peep from the corners of\ntheir eyes, was as good as almost any play without a hornpipe in it. It\nmade no difference, however. Very soon they came to settle it between\nthem. The low-born Bunny looked down upon Bardie for being so much\nsmaller, and the high-born Bardie looked down upon Bunny for being so\nmuch coarser. But neither was able to tell the other at all what her\nopinion was; and so, without any further trouble, they became very\nexcellent playmates.\n\nDoing my best to make them friends, I seized the little stranger, and\ngave her several good tosses-up, as well as tickles between them; and\nthis was more than she could resist, being, as her nature shows,\nthoroughly fond of any kind of pleasure and amusement. She laughed, and\nshe flung out her arms, and every time she made such jumps as to go up\nlike a feather. Pretty soon I saw, however, that this had gone on too\nlong for Bunny. She put her poor handkerchief out of sight, and then\nsome fingers into her mouth, and she looked as black as a dog in a\nkennel. But Bardie showed good-nature now, for she ran up to Bunny and\ntook her hand and led her to me, and said very nicely, ""Give this ickle\ngal some, old Davy. She haven\'t had no pay at all. Oh, hot boofley\nbuckens oo\'s got! Jolly, jolly! Keel song grand!""\n\nThis admiration of my buttons--which truly were very handsome, being on\nmy regulation-coat, and as good as gilt almost, with ""Minotaur"" (a kind\nof grampus, as they say) done round them--this appreciation of the navy\nmade me more and more perceive what a dear child was come ashore to us,\nand that we ought to look alive to make something out of her. If she had\nany friends remaining (and they could scarcely have all been drowned),\nbeing, as she clearly was, of a high and therefore rich family, it might\nbe worth ten times as much as even my boat had been to me, to keep her\nsafe and restore her in a fat state when demanded. With that I made up\nmy mind to take her home with me that very night, especially as Bunny\nseemed to have set up a wonderful fancy to her. But man sees single, God\nsees double, as our saying is, and her bits of French made me afraid\nthat she might after all be a beggar.\n\n""Now go and play, like two little dears, and remember whose day it is,""\nI said to them both, for I felt the duty of keeping my grandchild up to\nthe mark on all religious questions; ""and be sure you don\'t go near the\nwell, nor out of sight of the house at all, nor pull the tails of the\nchickens out, nor throw stones at the piggy-wiggy,"" for I knew what\nBunny\'s tricks were. ""And now, Watty, my boy, come and talk to me, and\nperhaps I will give you a juneating apple from my own tree under the\nClevice.""\n\nAlthough the heat was tremendous now (even inside those three-feet\nwalls), the little things did as I bade them. And I made the most of\nthis occasion to have a talk with Watkin, who told me everything he\nknew. His mother had not been down since dinner, which they always got\nanyhow; because his father, who had been poorly for some days, and\nfeverish, and forced to lie in bed a little, came to the top of the\nstairs, and called, requiring some attendance. What this meant I knew as\nwell as if I had seen black Evan there, parched with thirst and with\ngreat eyes rolling after helpless drunkenness, and roaring, with his\nnight-clothes on, for a quart of fresh-drawn ale.\n\nBut about the shipwrecked child Watty knew scarce anything. He had found\nher in his bed that morning--Moxy, no doubt, having been hard pushed\n(with her husband in that state) what to do. And knowing how kind young\nWatty was, she had quartered the baby upon him. But Watkin, though\ngifted with pretty good English (or ""Sassenach,"" as we call it) beyond\nall the rest of his family, could not follow the little creature in her\nmanner of talking; which indeed, as I found thereafter, nobody in the\nparish could do except myself, and an Englishwoman whose word was not\nworth taking.\n\n""Indeed and indeed then, Mr Llewellyn,"" he went on in English, having an\nevident desire to improve himself by discourse with me, ""I did try, and\nI did try; and my mother, she try too. Times and times, for sure we\ntried. But no use was the whole of it. She only shakes her head, and\nthinks with all her might, as you may say. And then she says \'No! I\'se\nnot hot you says. I\'se two years old, and I\'se Bardie. And my papa he be\nvery angy if \'e goes on so with me. My mama yoves me, and I yove her,\nand papa, and ickle bother, and everybody. But not the naughty bad man,\nI doesn\'t.\' That isn\'t true English now, I don\'t think; is it then, Mr\nLlewellyn?""\n\n""Certainly not,"" I answered, seeing that my character for good English\nwas at stake.\n\n""And mother say she know well enough the baby must be a foreigner. On\nher dress it is to show it. No name, as the Christians put, but marks\nwithout any meaning. And of clothes so few upon her till mother go to\nthe old cupboard. Rich people mother do say they must be; but dead by\nthis time, she make no doubt.""\n\n""Boy,"" I replied, ""your mother, I fear, is right in that particular. To\nme it is a subject of anxiety and sorrow. And I know perhaps more about\nit than any one else can pretend to do.""\n\nThe boy looked at me with wonder and eagerness about it. But I gave him\na look, as much as to say, ""Ask no more at present."" However, he was so\nfull of her that he could not keep from talking.\n\n""We asked who the naughty bad man was, but she was afraid at that, and\nwent all round the room with her eyes, and hid under mother\'s apron. And\ndreadful she cried at breakfast about her mama and her own spoon. To my\nheart I feel the pain when she does cry; I know I do. And then of a\nsudden she is laughing, and no reason for it! I never did see such a\nbaby before. Do you think so, Mr Llewellyn?""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSANDHILLS TURNED TO SAND-HOLES.\n\n\nWhile I was talking thus with the boy, and expecting his mother every\nminute (with hope of a little refreshment when the farmer should have\ndropped off into his usual Sunday sleep), a very strange thing began\nmore and more to force itself on my attention. I have said that the hall\nof this desolate house was large and long, and had six doorways--narrow\narches of heavy stone without a door to any of them. Three of these\narches were at the west and three at the east end of the room, and on\nthe south were two old windows, each in a separate gable, high up from\nthe floor, and dark with stone-work and with lead-work; and in the\ncalmest weather these would draw the air and make a rattle. At the north\nside of the hall was nothing but dead wall, and fireplace, and\ncupboards, and the broad oak staircase. Having used the freedom to light\na pipe, I sate with my face to the chimney-corner, where some wood-ashes\nwere smouldering, after the dinner was done with; and sitting thus, I\nbecame aware of a presence of some sort over my right shoulder. At first\nI thought it was nothing more than the smoke from my own pipe, for I\npuffed rather hard, in anxiety about that little darling. But seeing\nsurprise, and alarm perhaps, in Watkin\'s face, who sate opposite, I\nturned round, and there beheld three distinct and several pillars of a\nbrownish-yellow light standing over against the doorways of the western\nend.\n\nAt first I was a little scared, and the more so because the rest of the\nhall was darkening with a pulse of colour gradually vanishing; and for\nan instant I really thought that the ghosts of the wrecked child\'s\nfather and mother, and perhaps her nurse, were come to declare the truth\nabout her, and challenge me for my hesitation. But presently I called to\nmind how many strange things had befallen me, both at sea and on the\ncoast, in the way of feeling and vision too, designed, however, by the\nPower that sends them, more to forewarn than frighten us, and, as we get\nused to them, to amuse or edify.\n\nTherefore I plucked my spirit up and approached this odd appearance, and\nfound that no part of it was visible upon the spot where it seemed to\nstand. But Watkin, who was much emboldened by my dauntless carriage,\ncalled out in Welsh that he could see me walking in and out of them,\nlike so many haystacks. Upon this I took yet further courage, having a\nwitness so close at hand, and nothing seeming to hurt me. So what did I\ndo but go outside, without any motion of running away, but to face the\nthing to its utmost; and Watkin, keeping along the wall, took good care\nto come after me.\n\nHere I discovered in half a second that I had been wise as well as\nstrong in meeting the matter valiantly; for what we had seen was but the\nglancing--or reflection, as they call it now--of what was being done\noutside. In a word, the thick and stifling heat of the day (which had\ngathered to a head the glaring and blazing power of the last two months\nof hot summer) was just beginning to burst abroad in whirlwind, hail,\nand thunder. All the upper heaven was covered with a spread of burning\nyellow; all the half-way sky was red as blood with fibres under it, and\nall the sides and margin looked as black as the new-tarred bends of a\nship. But what threw me most astray was, that the whole was whirling,\ntossing upward jets of darkness, as a juggler flings his balls, yet at\none time spinning round, and at the same time scowling down.\n\n""It is a hurricane,"" said I, having seen some in the West Indies which\nbegan like this. Watkin knew not much of my meaning, but caught hold of\nmy coat, and stood. And in truth it was enough to make not only a slip\nof a boy, but a veteran sailor, stand and fear.\n\nNot a flash of lightning yet broke the expectation of it, nor had been a\ndrop of rain. But to my surprise, and showing how little we know of\nanything, over the high land broke a sand-storm, such as they have in\nAfrica. It had been brewing some time, most likely in the Kenfig\nburrows, toward the westward and the windward, although no wind was\nastir with us. I thought of a dance of waterspouts, such as we had twice\nencountered in the royal navy; once, I know, was after clearing the\nmouth of the Strait of Malaccas; where the other was I truly forget,\nhaving had so much to go everywhere. But this time the whirling stuff\nwas neither water, nor smoke, nor cloud; but sand, as plain as could be.\nIt was just like the parson\'s hour-glass--only going up, not coming\ndown, and quickly instead of slowly. And of these funnels, spinning\naround, and coming near and nearer, there may have been perhaps a dozen,\nor there may have been threescore. They differed very much in size,\naccording to the breadth of whirlwind, and the stuff it fed upon, and\nthe hole in the air it bored; but all alike had a tawny colour, and a\nmanner of bulking upward, and a loose uncertain edge, often lashing off\nin frays; and between them black clouds galloped; and sometimes two fell\ninto one, and bodily broke downward; then a pile (as big as Newton Rock)\nrose in a moment anyhow. Hill or valley made no odds; sandhill, or\nsand-bottom; the sand was in the place of the air, and the air itself\nwas sand.\n\nMany people have asked me, over and over again (because such a thing was\nscarcely known, except at the great storm of sand four hundred years\nago, they say)--our people, ever so many times, assert their privilege\nto ask me (now again especially) how many of these pillars there were! I\nwish to tell the truth exactly, having no interest in the matter--and if\nI had, no other matter would it be to me; and after going into my memory\ndeeper than ever I could have expected there would be occasion for, all\nI can say is this--legion was their number; because they were all coming\ndown upon me; and how could I stop to count them?\n\nWatkin lost his mind a little, and asked me (with his head gone under my\nregulation-coat) if I thought it was the judgment-day.\n\nTo this question I ""replied distinctly in the negative"" (as the man of\nthe paper wrote, when I said ""no"" about poaching); and then I cheered\nyoung Watkin up, and told him that nothing more was wanted than to keep\na weather-helm.\n\nBefore his wit could answer helm so much as to clear my meaning, the\nstorm was on me, and broke my pipe, and filled my lungs and all my\npockets, and spoiled every corner of the hat I had bought for my dear\nwife\'s funeral. I pulled back instantly (almost as quickly as boy Watkin\ncould), and we heard the sand burst over the house, with a rattle like\nshot, and a roar like cannon. And being well inside the walls, we fixed\nour eyes on one another, in the gloom and murkiness, as much as we could\ndo for coughing, to be sure of something.\n\n""Where is Bardie gone?"" I asked, as soon as my lungs gave speech to me:\nit should have been, ""Where is Bunny gone?"" But my head was full of the\nlittle one.\n\n""Who can tell?"" cried the boy, in Welsh, being thoroughly scared of his\nEnglish. ""Oh, Dyo dear, God the great only knows.""\n\n""God will guard her,"" I said softly, yet without pure faith in it,\nhaving seen such cruel things; but the boy\'s face moved me. Moreover,\nBardie seemed almost too full of life for quenching; and having escaped\nrocks, waves, and quicksands, surely she would never be wrecked upon dry\nland ignobly. Nevertheless, at the mere idea of those helpless little\nones out in all this raging havoc, tears came to my eyes, until the\nsand, of which the very house was full, crusted up and blinded them.\n\nIt was time to leave off thinking, if one meant to do any good. The\nwhirlwinds spun and whistled round us, now on this side, now on that;\nand the old house creaked and rattled as the weather pulled or pushed at\nit. The sand was drifted in the courtyard (without any special\nwhirlwind) three feet deep in the north-east corner; and the sky, from\nall sides, fell upon us, like a mountain undermined.\n\n""Boy, go into your mother,"" I said; and I thank God for enabling me,\nelse might she have been childless. ""Tell your mother not to be\nfrightened, but to get your father up, and to have the kettle boiling.""\n\n""Oh, Dyo--dear Dyo! let me come with you, after that poor little child,\nand after my five brothers.""\n\n""Go in, you helpless fool,"" I said; and he saw the set of my\ncountenance, and left me, though but half-content.\n\nIt needed all my strength to draw the door of the house behind me,\nalthough the wind was bent no more on one way than another, but\nuniversal uproar. And down-roar too; for it fell on my head quite as\nmuch as it jerked my legs, and took me aback, and took me in front, and\nspun me round, and laughed at me. Then of a sudden all wind dropped, and\nyellow sky was over me.\n\nWhat course to take (if I had the choice) in search of those poor\nchildren, was more at first than I could judge, or bring my mind to bear\nupon. For as sure as we live by the breath of the Lord, the blast of His\nanger deadens us.\n\nPerhaps it was my instinct only, having been so long afloat, which drove\nme, straight as affairs permitted, toward the margin of the sea. And\nperhaps I had some desire to know how the sea itself would look under\nthis strange visiting. Moreover, it may have come across me, without any\nthinking twice of it, that Bunny had an inborn trick of always running\ntoward the sea, as behoved a sailor\'s daughter.\n\nAnyhow, that way I took, so far as it was left to me to know the points\nof the compass, or the shape and manner of anything. For simple and\nshort as the right road was, no simpleton or shortwitted man could have\nhit it, or come near it, in that ravenous weather. In the whirl and\ngrim distortion of the air and the very earth, a man was walking (as you\nmight say) in the depth of a perfect calm, with stifling heat upon him,\nand a piece of shadow to know himself by; and then, the next moment,\nthere he was in a furious state of buffeting, baffled in front, and\nbelaboured aback, and bellowed at under the swing of his arms, and the\nstaggering failure of his poor legs.\n\nNevertheless, in the lull and the slack times, I did my utmost to get\non, having more presence of mind perhaps than any landsman could have\nowned. Poor fellows they are when it comes to blow; and what could they\ndo in a whirlwind?\n\nAs I began to think of them, and my luck in being a seaman, my courage\nimproved to that degree that I was able quite heartily to commend myself\nto the power of God, whom, as a rule, I remember best when the world\nseems coming to an end. And I think it almost certain that this piety on\nmy part enabled me to get on as I did.\n\nFor without any skill at all or bravery of mine, but only the calmness\nwhich fell upon me, as it used to do in the heat of battle, when I\nthought on my Maker, all at once I saw a way to elude a great deal of\nthe danger. This was as simple as could be, yet never would have come\nhome to a man unable to keep his wits about him.\n\nBlurred and slurred as the whole sky was with twisted stuff and with\nyellowness, I saw that the whirling pillars of sand not only whirled but\nalso travelled in one spiral only. They all came from the west, where\nlay the largest spread of sandhills, and they danced away to the\nnorth-east first, and then away to south of east, shaping a round like a\nship with her helm up, preserving their spiral from left to right as all\nwaterspouts do on the north of the Line.\n\nSo when a column of sand came nigh to suck me up, or to bury\nme--although it went thirty miles an hour, and I with the utmost care of\nmy life could not have managed ten perhaps--by porting my helm without\ncarrying sail, and so working a traverse, I kept the weather-gage of it\nand that made all the difference.\n\nOf course I was stung in the face and neck as bad as a thousand\nmusquitoes when the skirts of the whirl flapped round at me, but what\nwas that to care about? It gave me pleasure to walk in such peril, and\nfeel myself almost out of it by virtue of coolness and readiness.\nNevertheless it gave me far greater pleasure, I can assure you, to feel\nhard ground beneath my feet, and stagger along the solid pebbles of the\nbeach of Sker, where the sand-storm could not come so much.\n\nHereupon I do believe that, in spite of all my courage--so stout and\nstrong in the moment of trial--all my power fell away before the sense\nof safety. What could my old battered life matter to any one in the\nworld, except myself and Bunny? However, I was so truly thankful to kind\nProvidence for preserving it, that I cannot have given less than nine\njumps, and said, ""Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,"" three times over, and\nin both ways.\n\nThis brought me back to the world again, as any power of piety always\ndoes when I dwell therein, and it drove me thereupon to trust in\nProvidence no longer than the time was needful for me to recover\nbreathing.\n\nWhen I came to my breath and prudence, such a fright at first oppressed\nme, that I made a start for running into the foremost of the waves,\nthinking (if I thought at all) of lying down there, with my head kept\nup, and defying the sand to quench the sea.\n\nSoon, however, I perceived that this was not advisable. Such a roar\narose around me from the blows of hills and rocks, and the fretful\neagerness of the sea to be at war again, and the deep sound of the\ndistance--the voice of man could travel less than that of a sandpiper,\nand the foot of man might long to be the foot of a sandhopper. For the\nsea was rising fast up the verge of ground-swell, and a deep hoarse echo\nrolling down the shoaling of the surges. This to me was pleasant music,\nsuch as makes a man awake.\n\nThe colour of the sun and sky was just as I had once beholden near the\npearl-grounds of Ceylon, where the bottom of the sea comes up with a\nvery mournful noise, and the fish sing dirges, and no man, however clear\nof eye, can open the sea and the sky asunder. And by this time being\nable to look round a little--for the air was not so full of sand, though\nstill very thick and dusty--I knew that we were on the brink of a kind\nof tornado, as they call it in the tropics,--a storm that very seldom\ncomes into these northern latitudes, being raised by violence of heat,\nas I have heard a surveyor say, the air going upward rapidly, with a\ngreat hole left below it.\n\nNow as I stood on watch, as it were, and, being in such a situation,\nlonged for more tobacco, what came to pass was exactly this--so far as a\nman can be exact when his wits have long been failing him.\n\nThe heaven opened, or rather seemed to be cloven by a sword-sweep, and a\nsolid mass of lightning fell, with a cone like a red-hot anvil. The ring\nof black rocks received its weight, and leaped like a boiling caldron,\nwhile the stormy waters rose into a hiss and heap of steam. Then the\ncrash of heaven stunned me.\n\nWhen I came to myself it was raining as if it had never rained before.\nThe rage of sand and air was beaten flat beneath the rain, and the\nfretful lifting of the sea was hushed off into bubbles. What to do I\ncould not tell, in spite of all experience, but rubbed the sand from\nboth my eyes, as bad as the beard of an oyster, and could see no clear\nway anywhere.\n\nNow the sky was spread and traversed with a net of crossing fires, in\nand out like mesh and needle, only without time to look. Some were\nyellow, some deep red, and some like banks of violet, and others of a\npale sweet blue, like gazing through a window. They might have been very\nbeautiful, and agreeable to consider, if they had been further off, and\nwithout that wicked crack of thunder through the roar. Worse storms I\nhad seen, of course, in the hot world and up mountains, and perhaps\nthought little of them; but then there was this difference, I had always\nplenty of fellows with me, and it was not Sunday. Also, I then was\nyoung, and trained for cannons to be shot at me. Neither had I a boat of\nmy own, but my dear wife was alive.\n\nThese considerations moved me to be careful of my life--a duty which\nincreases on us after the turn of the balance; and seeing all things\nblack behind me, and a world of storm around, knowing every hole as I\ndid, with many commendations of myself to God for the sake of Bunny, in\nI went into a hole under a good solid rock, where I could watch the sea,\nand care for nothing but an earthquake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nUNDER THE ROCK.\n\n\nFor a while the power of the lightning seemed to quench the wind almost,\nand one continuous roar of thunder rang around the darkness. Then, with\na bellow, the wind sprang forth (like a wild bull out of a mountain),\nand shattered the rain and drowned the thunder, and was lord of\neverything. Under its weight the flat sea quivered, and the crests flew\ninto foam, and the scourge upon the waters seemed to beat them all\ntogether. The whirlwinds now were past and done with, and a violent gale\nbegun, and in the burst and change of movement there appeared a helpless\nship.\n\nShe was bearing towards Pool Tavan, as poor Bardie\'s boat had done, but\nwithout the summer glory and the golden wealth of waves. All was smooth\nand soft and gentle, as the moonlight in a glass, when the little boat\ncame gliding with its baby captain. All was rough and hard and furious\nas a fight of devils, when that ship came staggering with its load of\nsin and woe. And yet there had not been so much as twenty-four hours\nbetween the two.\n\nNot one of our little coasting vessels, but a full-rigged ship she\nloomed, of foreign build, although at present carrying no colours. I saw\nat once what her business was, to bring from the West Indies sugar, rum,\nand suchlike freight, to Bristol, or to the Dutchmen. This was in her\nclearance-bill; but behind that she had other import not so clearly\nentered. In a word, she carried negroes from the overstocked\nplantations, not to be quite slaves (at least in the opinion of their\nmasters), but to be distributed, for their own Christian benefit, at a\ncertain sum per head, among the Bristol or Dutch merchants, or wherever\nit might be. And it serves them right, I always say; for the fuss that\nwe now make about those black men must bring down the anger of the\nCreator, who made them black, upon us.\n\nAs the gale set to its work, and the sea arose in earnest, and the\nlightning drifted off into the scud of clouds, I saw, as plain as a\npikestaff, that the ship must come ashore, and go to pieces very likely,\nbefore one could say ""Jack Robinson."" She had been on the Sker-weather\nsands already, and lost her rudder and some of her sternpost, as the\nlift of the water showed; and now there was nothing left on board her of\ncourage or common seamanship. The truth of it was, although of course I\ncould not know it then, that nearly all the ship\'s company acted as was\nto be expected from a lot of foreigners; that is to say, if such they\nwere. They took to the boats in a kind of panic when first she struck\namong the sands in the whirlwind which began the storm. There could have\nbeen then no great sea running, only quiet rollers; and being but two\nmiles off the shore, they hoped, no doubt, to land well enough, after\nleaving the stupid negroes and the helpless passengers to the will of\nProvidence.\n\nHowever, before they had rowed a mile, with the flood-tide making\neastward, one of the boats was struck by lightning, and the other caught\nin a whirl vorago (as the Spaniards call it), and not a soul ever came\nto land, and scarcely any bodies. Both these accidents were seen from\nPorthcawl Point by Sandy Macraw through a telescope: and much as he was\nmine enemy, I do him the justice to believe it; partly because he could\nlook for no money from any lies in the matter, and still more because I\nhave heard that some people said that they saw him see it.\n\nBut to come back to this poor ship: the wind, though blowing madly\nenough (as a summer gale is often hotter for a while than a winter one),\nhad not time and sweep as yet to raise any very big rollers. The sea was\nsometimes beaten flat and then cast up in hillocks; but the mighty march\nof waters fetched by a tempest from the Atlantic was not come, and would\nnot come in a veering storm like this. For it takes a gale of at least\nthree tides, such as we never have in summer, to deliver the true buffet\nof the vast Atlantic.\n\nNevertheless the sea was nasty and exceeding vicious; and the wind more\nmadly wild, perhaps, than when it has full time to blow; in short, the\nwant of depth and power was made up by rage and spite. And for a ship\nnot thoroughly sound and stanch in all her timbers it had been better,\nperhaps, to rise and fall upon long billows, with a chance of casting\nhigh and dry, than to be twirled round and plucked at, thrown on\nbeam-ends, and taken aback, as this hapless craft was being, in the lash\nof rocky waters and the drift of gale and scud.\n\nBy this time she was close ashore, and not a man (except myself) to help\nor even pity her. All around her was wind and rocks, and a mad sea\nrushing under her. The negroes, crouching in the scuppers, or clinging\nto the masts and rails, or rolling over one another in their want of\npluck and skill, seemed to shed their blackness on the snowy spray and\ncurdled foam, like cuttle-fish in a lump of froth. Poor things! they are\ngrieved to die as much, perhaps, as any white man; and my heart was\novercome, in spite of all I know of them.\n\nThe ship had no canvas left, except some tatters of the fore-topsail,\nand a piece of the main-royals; but she drifted broadside on, I daresay\nfive or six knots an hour. She drew too much water, unluckily, to come\ninto Pool Tavan at that time of the tide, even if the mouth had been\nwide enough; but crash she went on a ledge of rocks thoroughly well\nknown to me, every shelf of which was a razor. Half a cable\'s length\nbelow the entrance to Pool Tavan, it had the finest steps and stairs for\ncongers and for lobsters, whenever one could get at it in a low\nspring-tide; but the worst of beaks and barbs for a vessel to strike\nupon at half-flow, and with a violent sea, and a wind as wild as Bedlam.\n\nWith the pressure of these, she lay so much to leeward before striking\n(and perhaps her cargo had shifted), that the poor blackies rolled down\nthe deck like pickling walnuts on a tray; and they had not even the\nchance of dying each in his own direction.\n\nI was forced to shut my eyes; till a grey squall came, and caught her\nup, as if she had been a humming-top, and flung her (as we drown a\nkitten) into the mashing waters.\n\nNow I hope no man who knows me would ever take me for such a fool as to\ndream for a moment--after all I have seen of them--that a negro is ""our\nown flesh and blood, and a brother immortal,"" as the parsons begin to\nprate, under some dark infection. They differ from us a great deal more\nthan an ass does from a horse; but for all that I was right down\nglad--as a man of loving-kindness--that such a pelt of rain came up as\nsaved me from the discomfort--or pain, if you must have the truth--of\nbeholding several score, no doubt, of unfortunate blacks a-drowning.\n\nIf it had pleased Providence to drown any white men with them, and to\nlet me know it, beyond a doubt I had rushed in, though without so much\nas a rope to help me; and as it was, I was ready to do my very best to\nsave them if they had only shown some readiness to be hawled ashore by a\nman of proper colour. But being, as negroes always are, of a most\ncontrary nature, no doubt they preferred to drift out to sea rather than\nChristian burial. At any rate, none of them came near me, kindly\ndisposed as I felt myself, and ready to tuck up my Sunday trousers at\nthe very first sight of a woolly head. But several came ashore next\ntide--when it could be no comfort at all to them. And such, as I have\nalways found, is the nature of black people.\n\nBut for me it was a sad, and, as I thought, severe, visitation to be\nforced on a Sabbath-day--my only holiday of the week--to meditate over a\nscene like this. As a truly consistent and truth-seeking Christian\n(especially when I go round with fish on a Monday morning among\nNonconformists), it was a bitter trial for me to reflect upon those\npoor negroes, gone without any sense at all, except of good Christians\'\nwickedness, to the judgment we decree for all, except ourselves and\nfamilies.\n\nBut there was worse than this behind; for after waiting as long as there\nseemed good chance of anything coming ashore, which might go into my\npocket, without risk of my pension, and would truly be mine in all\nhonesty--and after seeing that the wreck would not break up till the\ntide rose higher, though all on board were swept away--suddenly it came\ninto my head about poor Bardie and Bunny. They were worth all the\nniggers that ever made coal look the colour of pipeclay; and with a\ndepth of self-reproach which I never deserved to feel, having truly done\nmy utmost--for who could walk in such weather?--forth I set, resolved to\nface whatever came out of the heavens. Verily nothing could come much\nworse than what was come already. Rheumatics, I mean, which had struck\nme there, under the rock, as a snake might. Three hours ago all the\nworld was sweat, and now all the air was shivers. Such is the climate of\nour parts, and many good people rail at it, who have not been under\ndiscipline. But all who have felt that gnawing anguish, or that fiery\nfreezing, burning at once and benumbing (like a dead bone put into the\nlive ones, with a train of powder down it)--all these will have pity for\na man who had crouched beneath a rock for at least three hours, with\ndripping clothes, at the age of two-and-fifty.\n\nFor a hero I never set up to be, and never came across one until my old\nage in the navy, as hereafter to be related. And though I had served on\nboard of one in my early years, off La Hague and Cape Grisnez, they told\nme she was only a woman that used to hold a lantern. Hero, however, or\nno hero, in spite of all discouragement and the aching of my bones,\nresolved I was to follow out the fate of those two children. There\nseemed to be faint hope, indeed, concerning the little stranger; but\nBunny might be all alive and strong, as was right and natural for a\nchild of her age and substance. But I was sore downcast about it when I\nlooked around and saw the effect of the storm that had been over them.\nFor the alteration of everything was nothing less than amazing.\n\nIt is out of my power to tell you how my heart went up to God, and all\nmy spirit and soul was lifted into something purer, when of a sudden, in\na scoop of sand, with the rushes overhanging, I came on those two little\ndears, fast asleep in innocence. A perfect nest of peace they had, as if\nbeneath their Father\'s eye, and by His own hand made for them. The fury\nof the earth and sky was all around and over them; the deep revenge of\nthe sea was rolling, not a hundred yards away; and here those two little\ndots were asleep, with their angels trying to make them dream.\n\nBunny, being the elder and much the stronger child, had thrown the skirt\nof her frock across poor little Bardie\'s naked shoulders; while Bardie,\nfinding it nice and warm, had nestled her delicate head into the lap of\nher young nurse, and had tried (as it seemed), before dropping off, to\ntell her gratitude by pressing Bunny\'s red hands to her lips. In a word,\nyou might go a long way and scarcely see a prettier or more moving\npicture, or more apt to lead a man who seldom thinks of his Maker. As\nfor me, I became so proud of my own granddaughter\'s goodness, and of the\nlittle lady\'s trust and pure repose therein, that my heart went back at\nonce to my dead boy Harry, and I do believe that I must have wept, if I\ncould have stopped to look at them.\n\nBut although I was truly loath to spoil this pretty picture, the poor\nthings must be partly wet, even in that nest of rushes, which the\nwhirlwinds had not touched. So I awoke them very gently, and shook off\nthe sand, while they rubbed their eyes, and gaped, and knew no more of\ntheir danger than if they had been in their own dear beds. Then, with\nBardie in my arms, and Bunny trotting stoutly with her thumb spliced\ninto my trousers, I shaped a course for Sker farmhouse, having a strong\ngale still abaft, but the weather slightly moderating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nA WRECKER WRECKED.\n\n\nNear the gate I met Evan Thomas, the master of the house himself, at\nlength astir, but still three-parts drunk, and--if I may say so with due\ncompassion for the trouble then before him--in a very awkward state of\nmind. It happened so that the surliness of his liquor and of his nature\nmingled at this moment with a certain exultation, a sense of good-luck,\nand a strong desire to talk and be told again of it. And this is the\nnature of all Welshmen; directly they have any luck, they must begin to\nbrag of it. You will find the same in me perhaps, or, at any rate, think\nyou do, although I try to exclude it, having to deal with Englishmen,\nwho make nothing of all the great deeds they have done until you begin\nto agree with them. And then, my goodness, they do come out! But the\nobject of my writing is to make them understand us, which they never yet\nhave done, being unlike somehow in nature, although we are much of their\nfathers.\n\nHaving been almost equally among both these nations, and speaking\nEnglish better perhaps than my native tongue of the Cymry--of which\nanybody can judge who sees the manner in which I do it--it is against my\nwish to say what Evan Thomas looked like. His dark face, overhung with\nhair, and slouched with a night of drinking, was beginning to burn up,\nfrom paleness and from weariness, into a fury of plunder. Scarcely did I\nknow the man, although I had so many recollections of evil against him.\nA big, strong, clumsy fellow at all times, far more ready to smite than\nsmile, and wholly void of that pleasant humour, which among almost all\nmy neighbours--though never yet could I find out why--creates a pleasing\neagerness for my humble society as punctual as my pension-day.\n\nBut now his reeling staggering manner of coming along towards us, and\nthe hunching of his shoulders, and the swagging of his head, and, most\nof all, the great gun he carried, were enough to make good quiet people\nwho had been to church get behind a sandhill. However, for that it was\ntoo late. I was bound to face him. Bardie dropped her eyes under my\nbeard, and Bunny crept closer behind my leg. For my part, although the\nway was narrow, and the lift of the storm gave out some light, it would\nhave moved no resentment in me if he had seen (as rich men do) unfit to\nsee a poor man.\n\nHowever, there was no such luck. He carried his loaded gun with its\nmuzzle representing a point of view the very last I could have\ndesired--namely, at my midships; and he carried it so that I longed to\nhave said a little word about carefulness. But I durst not, with his\ncoal-black eyes fixed upon me as they were, and so I pulled up suddenly.\nFor he had given me an imperious nod, as good as ordering me to stop.\n\n""Wreck ashore!"" he cried out in Welsh, having scarce a word of\nEnglish--""wreck ashore! I smell her, Dyo. Don\'t tell me no lies, my boy.\nI smelled her all the afternoon. And high time to have one.""\n\n""There is a wreck ashore,"" I answered, looking with some disgust at him,\nas a man who has been wrecked himself must do at a cruel wrecker; ""but\nthe ebb most likely will draw her off and drift her into the\nquicksands.""\n\n""Great God! speak not like that, my boy. The worst you are of\neverything. If those two children came ashore, there must have been\nsomething better."" And he peered at the children as if to search for any\ngold upon them.\n\n""Neither child came from that wreck. One is my granddaughter Bunny.\nBunny, show yourself to black Evan."" But the child shrank closer behind\nme. ""Evan black, you know her well. And the other is a little thing I\npicked up on the coast last night.""\n\n""Ha, ha! you pick up children where you put them, I suppose. But take\nthem indoors and be done with them. Cubs to come with a wreck ashore, a\nnoble wreck ashore, I say! But come you down again, fisherman Dyo."" He\nused the word ""fisherman"" with a peculiar stress, and a glance of\nsuspicion at my pockets. ""Come you down again, Dyo dear. I shall want\nyou to help me against those thieves from Kenfig. Bring my other gun\nfrom the clock-case, and tell the boys to run down with their\nbando-sticks. I\'ll warrant we\'ll clear the shore between us; and then,\ngood Dyo, honest Dyo, you shall have some--you shall, you dog.\nFair-play, Dyo; fair share and share, though every stick is mine of\nright. Ah, Dyo, Dyo, you cunning sheep\'s head, you love a keg of rum,\nyou dog.""\n\nThis I knew to be true enough, but only within the bounds of both\nhonesty and sobriety. But so much talking had made his brain, in its\npresent condition, go round again; and while I was thinking how far it\nmight be safe and right to come into his views, his loaded gun began\nwagging about in a manner so highly dangerous, that for the sake of the\ntwo poor children I was obliged to get out of his way, and, looking back\nfrom a safer distance, there I beheld him flourishing with his arms on\nthe top of a sandhill, and waving his hat on the top of his gun, for\nhis sons to come over the warren.\n\nMoxy Thomas was very kind; she never could help being so, and therefore\nnever got any thanks. She stripped the two wet children at once, and put\nthem in bed together to keep each other warm. But first she had them\nsnugly simmering in a milk-pan of hot water with a little milk for the\nsake of their skins. Bunny was heavy and sleepy therein, and did nothing\nbut yawn and stretch out her arms. Bardie, on the other hand, was ready\nto boil over with delight and liveliness, flashing about like a little\ndab-chick.\n\n""Old Davy,"" she said, as I came to see her at her own invitation, and\nshe sate quite over Bunny, ""\'Ill \'a have a ickle dop?"" With the water up\nto her neck, she put one mite of a transparent finger to my grizzled\nmouth, and popped a large drop in, and laughed, until I could have\nworshipped her.\n\nNow, having seen these two little dears fast asleep and warmly\ncompassed, I began, according to Evan\'s orders, to ask about the boys,\nnot having seen any sign of them. Moxy said that Watkin went out to look\nfor his five brothers about an hour after I had left, and in spite of\nthe rain and lightning. She had tried in vain to stop him: something was\non his mind, it seemed; and when she went up to attend on his father, he\ntook the opportunity to slip out of the kitchen.\n\nNow Moxy having been in the house, and the house away from the worst of\nthe storm, being moreover a woman, and therefore wholly abroad about\nweather, it was natural that she should not have even the least idea of\nthe jeopardy encountered by her five great sons in the warren. Enough\nfor her that they were not at sea. Danger from weather upon dry land was\nout of her comprehension.\n\nIt wanted perhaps half an hour of dusk, and had given over raining, but\nwas blowing a good reef-topsail gale, when I started to search for the\nsons of Sker. Of course I said nothing to make their mother at all\nuneasy about them, but took from the clock-case the loaded gun (as Evan\nhad commanded me), and set forth upon the track of young Watkin, better\nfoot foremost. For he was likely to know best what part of the warren\nhis five great brothers had chosen for their sport that day; and in the\nwet sand it was easy to follow the course the boy had taken.\n\nThe whirlwinds had ceased before he went forth, and the deluge of rain\nwas now soaked in, through the drought so long abiding. But the wind was\nwailing pitifully, and the rushes swaying wearily; and the yellow\nbaldness, here and there, of higher sandhills, caught the light. Ragged\nclouds ran over all, and streamers of the sunset; and the sky was like a\nschool let loose, with the joy of wind and rain again. It is not much of\nme that swears, when circumstances force me; only a piece, perhaps, of\ncustom, and a piece of honesty. These two lead one astray sometimes; and\nthen comes disappointment. For I had let some anger vex me at the\nrudeness of black Evan, and the ungodliness of his sons, which forced me\nthus to come abroad, when full of wet and weariness. In spite of this,\nI was grieved and frightened, and angry with no one but myself, when I\nchanced upon boy Watkin, fallen into a tuft of rushes, with his blue\neyes running torrents. There he lay, like a heap of trouble, as young\nfolk do ere they learn the world; and I put him on his legs three times,\nbut he managed to go down again. At last I got his knees to stick; but\neven so he turned away, and put his head between his hands, and could\nnot say a word to me. And by the way his shoulders went, I knew that he\nwas sobbing. I asked him what the matter was, and what he was taking so\nmuch to heart; and, not to be too long over a trifle, at last I got this\nout of him:--\n\n""Oh, good Mr Llewellyn, dear, I never shall see nothing more of my great\nbrothers five, so long as ever I do live. And when they kicked me out of\nbed every Sunday morning, and spread the basins over me, it was not that\nthey meant to harm--I do feel it, I do feel it; and perhaps my knees ran\ninto them. Under the sands, the sands, they are; and never to kick me\nagain no more! Of sorrow it is more than ever I can tell.""\n\n""Watty,"" said I, ""why talk you so? Your brothers know every crick and\ncorner of this warren, miles and miles; and could carry a sandhill\namong them. They are snug enough somewhere with their game, and perhaps\ngone to sleep, like the little ones.""\n\nOf the babies\' adventures he knew nothing, and only stared at me; so I\nasked him what had scared him so.\n\n""Under the sands, the sands, they are, so sure as ever I do live. Or the\nrabbit-bag would not be here, and Dutch, who never, never leaves them,\nhowling at the rabbit-bag!""\n\nLooking further through the tussocks, I saw that it was even so. Dutch,\nthe mongrel collie, crouched beside a bag of something, with her tail\ncurled out of sight, and her ears laid flat and listless, and her jowl\nalong the ground. And every now and then she gave a low but very\ngrievous howl.\n\n""Now, boy, don\'t be a fool,"" I said, with the desire to encourage him;\n""soon we shall find your brothers five, with another great sack of\nrabbits. They left the bitch yonder to watch the sack, while they went\non for more, you see.""\n\n""It is the sack; the sack it is! And no other sack along of them. Oh, Mr\nLlewellyn, dear, here is the bag, and there is Dutch, and never no sign\nat all of them!""\n\nAt this I began to fear indeed that the matter was past helping--that\nan accident and a grief had happened worse than the drowning of all the\nnegroes, which it has ever pleased Providence (in a darkness of mood) to\ncreate for us. But my main desire was to get poor Watty away at once,\nlest he should encounter things too dreadful for a boy like him.\n\n""Go home,"" I said, ""with the bag of rabbits, and give poor Dutch her\nsupper. Your father is down on the shore of the sea, and no doubt the\nboys are with him. They are gone to meet a great shipwreck, worth all\nthe rabbits all the way from Dunraven to Giant\'s Grave.""\n\n""But little Dutch, it is little Dutch! They never would leave her, if\nwreck there was. She can fetch out of the water so good almost as any\ndog.""\n\nI left him to his own devices, being now tired of arguing. For by this\ntime it was growing dark; and a heavy sea was roaring; and the wreck was\nsure to be breaking up, unless she had been swallowed up. And the\ncommon-sense of our village, and parish, would go very hard against me\nfor not being on the spot to keep the adjacent parish from stealing. For\nKenfig and Newton are full of each other, with a fine old ancient\nhatred. So we climbed over the crest of high sand, where the rushes lay\nweltering after the wind; and then with a plunge of long strides down\nhill, and plucking our feet out hastily, on the watered marge we stood,\nto which the sea was striving.\n\nAmong the rocks black Evan leaped, with white foam rushing under him,\nand sallies of the stormy tide volleying to engulf him. Strong liquor\nstill was in his brain, and made him scorn his danger, and thereby saved\nhim from it. One timid step, and the churning waters would have made a\ncurd of him. The fury of his visage showed that somebody had wronged\nhim, after whom he rushed with vengeance, and his great gun swinging.\n\n""Sons of dogs!"" he cried in Welsh, alighting on the pebbles; ""may the\ndevil feed their fathers with a melting bowl!""\n\n""What\'s the rumpus now?"" I asked; ""what have your sons been doing?""\n\nFor he always swore at his sons as freely as at anybody\'s, and at\nhimself for begetting them.\n\n""My sons!"" he cried, with a stamp of rage; ""if my sons had been here,\nwhat man would have dared to do on the top of my head this thing? Where\nare they? I sent you for them.""\n\n""I have sought for them high and low,"" I answered; ""here is the only one\nI could find.""\n\n""Watkin! What use of Watkin? A boy like a girl or a baby! I want my five\ntall bully-boys to help their poor father\'s livelihood. There\'s little\nTom tailor gone over the sandhills with a keg of something; and Teddy\nshoemaker with a spar; and I only shot between them! Cursed fool! what\nshall I come to, not to be able to shoot a man?""\n\nHe had fired his gun, and was vexed, no doubt, at wasting a charge so\nrandomly; then spying his other gun on my shoulder, with the flint and\nthe priming set, he laid his heavy hand on it. I scarce knew what to do,\nbut feared any accident in the struggle; and after all, he was not so\ndrunk that the law would deny him his own gun.\n\n""Ha, ha!"" with a pat of the breech, he cried; ""for this I owe thee a\ngood turn, Dyo. Thou art loaded with rocks, my darling, as the other was\nwith cowries. Twenty to the pound of lead for any long-shore robbers. I\nsee a lot more sneaking down. Dyo, now for sport, my boy.""\n\nI saw some people, dark in the distance, under the brow of a sandhill;\nand before I could speak or think, black Evan was off to run at them. I\ntoo set my feet for speed, but the strings of my legs hung backward; and\nWatty, who could run like a hare, seemed to lag behind me. And behind\nhim there was little Dutch, crawling with her belly down, and her eyes\nturned up at us, as if we were dragging her to be hanged.\n\nUntil we heard a shout of people, through the roar of wind and sea, in\nfront of where black Evan strode; and making towards it, we beheld, in\nglimmering dusk of shore and sky, something we knew nothing of.\n\nA heavy sandhill hung above them, with its brow come over; and long\nroots of rushes naked in the shrillness of the wind. Under this were men\nat work, as we work for lives of men; and their Sunday shirt-sleeves\nflashed, white like ghosts, and gone again. Up to them strode Evan\nblack, over the marge of the wild March tides; and grounded his gun and\nlooked at them. They for a breath gazed up at him, and seemed to think\nand wonder; and then, as though they had not seen him, fell again\na-digging.\n\n""What means this?"" he roared at them, with his great eyes flashing fire,\nand his long gun levelled. But they neither left their work nor lifted\nhead to answer him. The yellow sand came sliding down, in wedge-shaped\nrunnels, over them, and their feet sank out of sight; but still they\nkept on working.\n\n""Come away, then, Evan great; come away and seek for wreck,"" I shouted,\nwhile he seemed to stand in heaviness of wonder. ""This is not a place\nfor you. Come away, my man, my boy.""\n\nThus I spoke, in Welsh of course, and threw my whole weight on his arm,\nto make him come away with me. But he set his feet in sand, and spread\nhis legs, and looked at me; and the strongest man that was ever born\ncould not have torn him from his hold, with those eyes upon him.\n\n""Dyo, I am out of dreaming. Dyo, I must see this wreck; only take the\ngun from me.""\n\nThis I would have done right gladly, but he changed his mind about it,\nfalling back to a savage mood.\n\n""You down there, who gave you leave to come and dig my sandhills?\nAnswer, or have skins of lead.""\n\nTwo or three of the men looked up, and wanted to say something. But the\nhead-man from the mines, who understood the whole of them, nodded, and\nthey held their tongues. Either they were brave men all (which never is\nwithout discipline), or else the sense of human death confused and\noverpowered them. Whatever they meant, they went on digging.\n\n""Some damned sailor under there,"" cried Evan, losing patience; ""little\nmustard-spoons of sand. Can\'t you throw it faster? Fine young fellows\nthree of them, in the hole their own ship made, last March tide, it must\nhave been. Let us see this new batch come. They always seem to have\nspent their wages before they learn to drown themselves.""\n\nHe laughed and laid his gun aside, and asked me for tobacco, and, trying\nto be sober, sang ""the rising of the lark."" I, for my part, shrunk away,\nand my flesh crawled over me.\n\n""Work away, my lads, work away. You are all of a mind to warm\nyourselves. Let me know when you have done. And all you find belongs to\nme. I can sit and see it out, and make a list of everything. Ear-rings\ngold, and foreign pieces, and the trinkets they have worn. Out with\nthem! I know them all. Fools! what use of skulking? You are on soft\nstuff, I see. Have out every one of them.""\n\nSo they did; and laid before him, in the order of their birth, the\ncarcases of his five sons. Evan first, his eldest born; Thomas next, and\nRees, and Hopkin, and then (with the sigh of death still in him) Jenkin,\nnewly turned fifteen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHOW TO SELL FISH.\n\n\nWhat I had seen that night upset me more than I like to dwell upon. But\nwith all my fish on hand, I was forced to make the best of it. For a\ndown-hearted man will turn meat, as we say, and much more, fish, to a\nfarthing\'s-worth. And though my heart was sore and heavy for my ancient\nsweetheart Moxy, and for little Bardie in the thick of such disasters,\nthat could be no excuse to me for wasting good fish--or at least pretty\ngood--and losing thoroughly good money.\n\nHere were the mullet, with less of shine than I always recommended and\nhonestly wish them to possess; here were the prawns, with a look of\npaleness and almost of languishing, such as they are bound to avoid\nuntil money paid and counted; and most of all, here were lawful bass, of\nvery great size and substance, inclined to do themselves more justice in\nthe scales than on the dish.\n\nI saw that this would never answer to my present high repute. Concerning\nquestions afterwards, and people being hard upon me, out of thoughtless\nignorance, that was none of my affair. The whole of that would go, of\ncourse, upon the weather and sudden changes, such as never were known\nbefore. And if good religious people would not so be satisfied with the\nwill of Providence to have their fish as fish are made, against them I\nhad another reason, which never fails to satisfy.\n\nThe ""burning tide,"" as they called it (through which poor Bardie first\nappeared), had been heard of far inland, and with one consent pronounced\nto be the result of the devil improperly flipping his tail while\nbathing. Although the weather had been so hot, this rumour was beyond my\nbelief; nevertheless I saw my way, if any old customer should happen,\nwhen it came to his dinner-time, to be at all discontented (which no man\nwith a fine appetite and a wholesome nose should indulge in)--I saw my\nway to sell him more, upon the following basket-day, by saying what good\npeople said, and how much I myself had seen of it.\n\nWith these reflections I roused my spirits, and resolved to let no good\nfish be lost, though it took all the week to sell them. For, in spite of\nthe laws laid down in the books (for young married women, and so\nforth), there is scarcely any other thing upon which both men and women\nmay be led astray so pleasantly as why to buy fish, and when to buy\nfish, and what fish to buy.\n\nTherefore I started in good spirits on the Monday morning, carrying with\nme news enough to sell three times the weight I bore, although it was\nbreaking my back almost. Good fish it was, and deserved all the praise\nthat ever I could bestow on it, for keeping so well in such shocking\nweather; and so I sprinkled a little salt in some of the delicate\nplaces, just to store the flavour there; for cooks are so forgetful, and\nalways put the blame on me when they fail of producing a fine fresh\nsmell.\n\nAlso knowing, to my sorrow, how suspicious people are, and narrow-minded\nto a degree none would give them credit for, I was forced to do a thing\nwhich always makes me to myself seem almost uncharitable.\n\nBut I felt that I could trust nobody to have proper faith in me,\nespecially when they might behold the eyes of the fishes retire a\nlittle, as they are very apt to do when too many cooks have looked at\nthem. And knowing how strong the prejudice of the public is in this\nrespect, I felt myself bound to gratify it, though at some cost of time\nand trouble. This method I do not mind describing (as I am now pretty\nclear of the trade) for the good of my brother fishermen.\n\nWhen the eyes of a fish begin to fail him through long retirement from\nthe water, you may strengthen his mode of regarding the world (and\ntherefore the world\'s regard for him) by a delicate piece of handling.\nKeep a ray-fish always ready--it does not matter how stale he is--and on\nthe same day on which you are going to sell your bass, or mullet, or\ncod, or whatever it may be, pull a few sharp spines, as clear as you\ncan, out of this good ray. Then open the mouth of your languid fish and\nembolden the aspect of either eye by fetching it up from despondency\nwith a skewer of proper length extended from one ball to the other. It\nis almost sure to drop out in the cooking; and even if it fails to do\nso, none will be the wiser, but take it for a provision of nature--as\nindeed it ought to be.\n\nNow, if anybody is rude enough to gainsay your fish in the market, you\nhave the evidence of the eyes and hands against that of the nose alone.\n""Why, bless me, madam,"" I used to say, ""a lady like you, that\nunderstands fish a great deal better than I do! His eyes are coming out\nof his head, ma\'am, to hear you say such things of him. Afloat he was at\nfour this morning, and his eyes will speak to it."" And so he was, well\nafloat in my tub, before I began to prepare him for a last appeal to the\npublic. Only they must not float too long, or the scales will not be\nstiff enough.\n\nBeing up to a few of these things, and feeling very keenly how hard the\npublic always tries to get upper hand of me, and would beat me down to\nhalf nothing a pound (if allowed altogether its own way), I fought very\nbravely the whole of that Monday to turn a few honest shillings. ""Good\nold Davy, fine old Davy, brave old Davy!"" they said I was every time I\nabated a halfpenny; and I called them generous gentlemen and\nChristian-minded ladies every time they wanted to smell my fish, which\nis not right before payment. What right has any man to disparage the\nproperty of another? When you have bought him, he is your own, and you\nhave the title to canvas him; but when he is put in the scales, remember\n""nothing but good of the dead,"" if you remember anything.\n\nAs I sate by the cross roads in Bridgend on the bottom of a bucket, and\nwith a four-legged dressing-table (hired for twopence) in front of me,\nwho should come up but the well-known Brother Hezekiah? Truly tired I\nwas getting, after plodding through Merthyr Mawr, Ogmore, and Ewenny,\nLlaleston, and Newcastle, and driven at last to the town of Bridgend.\nFor some of my fish had a gamesome odour, when first I set off in the\nmorning; and although the rain had cooled down the air, it was now\nbecome an unwise thing to recommend what still remained to any man of\nunchristian spirit, or possessing the ear of the magistrates.\n\nNow perhaps I should not say this thing, and many may think me inclined\nto vaunt, and call me an old coxcomb; but if any man could sell stinking\nfish in the times of which I am writing--and then it was ten times\nharder than now, because women looked after marketing--that man I verily\nbelieve was this old Davy Llewellyn; and right he has to be proud of it.\nBut what were left on my hands that evening were beginning to get so\nstrong, that I feared they must go over Bridgend bridge into the river\nOgmore.\n\nThe big coach with the London letters, which came then almost twice\na-week, was just gone on, after stopping three hours to rest the horses\nand feed the people; and I had done some business with them, for London\nfolk for the most part have a kind and pleasing ignorance. They paid me\nwell, and I served them well with fish of a fine high flavour; but now I\nhad some which I would not offer to such kind-hearted gentry.\n\nHezekiah wanted fish. I saw it by his nostrils, and I knew it for\ncertain when he pretended not to see me or my standing. He went a good\nbit round the corner, as if to deal with the ironmonger. But for all\nthat, I knew as well as if I could hear his wife beginning to rake the\nfire, that fish for supper was the business which had brought him across\nthe bridge. Therefore I refused an offer which I would have jumped at\nbefore seeing Hezekiah, of twopence a-pound for the residue from an old\nwoman who sold pickles; and I made up my mind to keep up the price,\nknowing the man to have ten in family, and all blessed with good\nappetites.\n\n""What, Davy! Brother Davy!"" he cried, being compelled to begin, because\nI took care not to look at him. ""Has it been so ordered that I behold\ngood brother Davy with fish upon a Monday?"" His object in this was plain\nenough--to beat down my goods by terror of an information for\nSabbath-labour.\n\n""The Lord has been merciful to me,"" I answered, patting my best fish on\nhis shoulder; ""not only in sending them straight to my net, at nine\no\'clock this morning; but also, brother Hezekiah, in the hunger all\npeople have for them. I would that I could have kept thee a taste; not\nsoon wouldst thou forget it. Sweeter fish and finer fish never came out\nof Newton Bay""--this I said because Newton Bay is famous for high\nquality. ""But, brother Hezekiah, thou art come too late."" And I began to\npack up very hastily.\n\n""What!"" cried Hezekiah, with a keen and hungrily grievous voice; ""all\nthose fish bespoken, Davy?""\n\n""Every one of them bespoken, brother; by a man who knows a right down\ngood bass, better almost than I do. Griffy, the \'Cat and Snuffers.\'""\n\nNow, Griffith, who kept the ""Cat and Snuffers,"" was a very jovial man,\nand a bitter enemy to Hezekiah Perkins; and I knew that the latter would\ngladly offer a penny a-pound upon Griffy\'s back, to spoil him of his\nsupper, and to make him offend his customers.\n\n""Stop, brother Davy,"" cried Hezekiah, stretching out his broad fat\nhands, as I began to pack my fish, with the freshest smellers uppermost;\n""Davy dear, this is not right, nor like our ancient friendship. A rogue\nlike Griffy to cheat you so! What had he beaten you down to, Davy?""\n\n""Beaten me down!"" I said, all in a hurry; ""is it likely I would be\nbeaten down, with their eyes coming out of their heads like that?""\n\n""Now, dear brother Dyo, do have patience! What was he going to give you\na-pound?""\n\n""Fourpence a-pound, and ten pound of them. Three-and-fourpence for a lot\nlike that! Ah, the times are bad indeed!""\n\n""Dear brother Dyo, fourpence-halfpenny! Three-and-nine down, for the lot\nas it stands.""\n\n""Hezekiah, for what do you take me? Cut a farthing in four, when you get\nit. Do I look a likely man to be a rogue for fivepence?""\n\n""No, no, Davy; don\'t be angry with me. Say as much as tenpence.\nFour-and-twopence, ready money; and no Irish coinage.""\n\n""Brother Hezekiah,"" said I, ""a bargain struck is a bargain kept. Rob a\nman of his supper for tenpence!""\n\n""Oh, Dyo, Dyo! you never would think of that man\'s supper, with my wife\nlonging for fish so! Such a family as we have, and the weakness in\nHepzibah\'s back! Five shillings for the five, Davy.""\n\n""There, there; take them along,"" I cried at last, with a groan from my\nchest: ""you are bound to be the ruin of me. But what can I do with a\ndelicate lady? Brother, surely you have been a little too hard upon me.\nWhatever shall I find to say to a man who never beats me down?""\n\n""Tell that worldly \'Cat and Snuffers\' that your fish were much too\ngood--why, Davy, they seem to smell a little!""\n\n""And small use they would be, Hezekiah, either for taste or for\nnourishment, unless they had the sea-smell now. Brother, all your money\nback, and the fish to poor Griffy, if you know not the smell of salt\nwater yet.""\n\n""Now, don\'t you be so hot, old Davy. The fish are good enough, no doubt;\nand it may be from the skewer-wood; but they have a sort, not to say a\nsmell, but a manner of reminding one----""\n\n""Of the savoury stuff they feed on,"" said I; ""and the thorough good use\nthey make of it. A fish must eat, and so must we, and little blame to\nboth of us.""\n\nWith that he bade me ""good-night,"" and went with alacrity towards his\nsupper, scornfully sneering as he passed the door of the ""Cat and\nSnuffers."" But though it was a fine thing for me, and an especial\nProvidence, to finish off my stock so well, at a time when I would have\ntaken gladly a shilling for the lot of it, yet I felt that circumstances\nwere against my lingering. Even if Hezekiah, unable to enter into the\nvein of my fish, should find himself too fat to hurry down the steep\nhill after me, still there were many other people, fit for supper, and\nfresh for it, from the sudden coolness, whom it was my duty now to\npreserve from mischief; by leaving proper interval for consideration,\nbefore I might happen to be in front of their dining room windows\nanother day.\n\nTherefore, with a grateful sense of goodwill to all customers, I thought\nit better to be off. There I had been, for several hours, ready to prove\nanything, but never challenged by anybody; and my spirit had grown\naccordingly. But I never yet have found it wise to overlie success. Win\nit, and look at it, and be off, is the quickest way to get some more. So\nI scarcely even called so much as a pint at the ""Cat and Snuffers,"" to\nhave a laugh with Griffy; but set off for Newton, along the old road,\nwith a good smart heel, and a fine day\'s business, and a light heart\ninside of me.\n\nWhen I had passed Red-hill and Tythegston, and clearly was out upon\nNewton Down, where the glow-worms are most soft and sweet, it came upon\nme, in looking up from the glow-worms to the stars of heaven, to think\nand balance how far I was right in cheating Hezekiah. It had been done\nwith the strictest justice, because his entire purpose was purely to\ncheat me. Whereupon Providence had stepped in and seen that I was the\nbetter man. I was not so ungrateful--let nobody suppose it--as to repine\nat this result. So far from that, that I rattled my money and had a good\nlaugh, and went on again. But being used to watch the stars, as an old\nsailor is bound to do, I thought that Orion ought to be up, and I could\nnot see Orion. This struck me as an unkindly thing, although, when I\nthought of it next day, I found that Orion was quite right, and perhaps\nthe beer a little strong which had led me to look out for him; anyhow,\nit threw me back to think of Hezekiah, and make the worst of him to\nmyself for having had the best of him.\n\nEverybody may be sure that I never would have gone out of the way to\ndescribe my traffic with that man unless there were good reason. Nay,\nbut I wanted to show you exactly the cast and the colour of man he was,\nby setting forth his low attempt to get my fish for nothing.\n\nThere was no man, of course, in my native village, and very few in\nBridgend perhaps, to whom I would have sold those fish, unless they were\ngoing to sell it again. But Hezekiah Perkins, a member and leading elder\nof the ""Nicodemus-Christians,"" was so hard a man to cheat--except by\nstirring of his gall--and so keen a cheat himself; so proud, moreover,\nof his wit and praying, and truly brotherly,--that to lead him astray\nwas the very first thing desired by a sound Churchman.\n\nBy trade and calling he had been--before he received his special\ncall--no more than a common blacksmith. Now a blacksmith is a most\nuseful man, full of news and full of jokes, and very often by no means\ndrunk; this, however, was not enough to satisfy Hezekiah. Having parts,\nas he always told us--and sometimes we wished that he had no\nwhole--cultivated parts, moreover, and taken up by the gentry, nothing\nof a lower order came up to his merits than to call himself as follows:\n""Horologist, Gunsmith, Practical Turner, Working Goldsmith and Jeweller,\nMaker of all Machinery, and Engineman to the King and Queen.""\n\nThe first time he put this over his door, all the neighbours laughed at\nhim, knowing (in spite of the book he had got full of figures and shapes\nand crossings, which he called ""Three-gun-ometry"") that his education\nwas scarcely up to the rule of three, without any guns. Nevertheless he\ngot on well, having sense enough to guide him when to talk large (in the\npresence of people who love large talk, as beyond them), and when to\nsing small, and hold his tongue, and nod at the proper distances, if\never his business led him among gentry of any sense or science, such as\nwe sometimes hear of. Hence it was that he got the order to keep the\nchurch-clock of Bridgend a-going by setting the hands on twice a-day,\nand giving a push to the pendulum; and so long as the clock would only\ngo, nobody in the town cared a tick whether it kept right time or wrong.\nAnd if people from the country durst say anything about it, it was\nalways enough to ask them what their own clocks had to say.\n\nThere were not then many stable-clocks, such as are growing upon us now,\nso that every horse has his own dinner-bell; only for all those that\nwere, Hezekiah received, I daresay, from five to ten shillings a-month\napiece in order to keep them moving. But, bless my heart! he knew less\nof a clock than I, old Davy Llewellyn, and once on a time I asked him,\nwhen he talked too much of his ""ometries""--as a sailor might do in his\nsimpleness--I asked him to take an ""observation,"" as I had seen a good\ndeal of it. But all he did was to make a very profane and unpleasant\none. As for this man\'s outward looks, he was nothing at all particular,\nbut usually with dirt about him, and a sense of oiliness. Why he must\nneeds set up for a saint the father of evil alone may tell; but they\nsaid that the clock that paid him best (being the worst in the\nneighbourhood) belonged to a Nicodemus-Christian, with a great cuckoo\nover it. Having never seen it, I cannot say; and the town is so full of\ngossip that I throw myself down on my back and listen, being wholly\nunable to vie with them in depth or in compass of story-telling, even\nwhen fish are a week on my hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE CORONER AND THE CORONET.\n\n\nAn officer of high repute had lately been set over us, to hold account\nof the mischief, and to follow evidence, and make the best he could of\nit when anybody chose to die without giving proper notice. He called\nhimself ""Coroner of the King;"" and all the doctors, such as they were,\nmade it a point that he must come, whenever there was a dead man or\nwoman who had died without their help.\n\nNow all about the storm of sand, and all about the shipwreck, was known\nin every part of the parish, before the church clock had contrived, in\ngratitude to Hezekiah, to strike the noon of Monday. Every child that\nwent to the well knew the truth of everything; and every woman of Newton\nand Nottage had formed from the men her own opinion, and was ready to\nstand thereby, and defy all the other women.\n\nNevertheless some busy doctor (who had better been in the stocks) took\nit for a public duty to send notice and demand for the Coroner to sit\nupon us. The wrath of the parish (now just beginning to find some wreck,\nthat would pay for the ropes) was so honest and so grave, that the\nlittle doctor was compelled to run and leave his furniture. And so it\nalways ought to be with people who are meddlesome.\n\nIt came to my knowledge that this must happen, and that I was bound to\nhelp in it, somewhere about middle-day of Tuesday; at a time when I was\nnot quite as well as I find myself when I have no money. For, being\npleased with my luck perhaps, and not content quite to smoke in the\ndark, and a little dry after the glow-worms, it happened (I will not\npretend to say how) that I dropped into the ""Jolly Sailors,"" to know\nwhat the people could be about, making such a great noise as they were,\nand keeping a quiet man out of his bed.\n\nThere I smelled a new tobacco, directly I was in the room; and somebody\n(pleased with my perception) gave me several pipes of it, with a\nthimbleful--as I became more and more agreeable--of a sort of\nrum-and-water. And, confining myself, as my principle is, to what the\npublic treat me to, it is not quite out of the question that I may have\nbeen too generous. And truly full I was of grief, upon the following\nmorning, that somebody had made me promise, in a bubbling moment, to be\nthere again, and bring my fiddle, on the Tuesday night.\n\nNow, since the death of my dear wife, who never put up with my fiddle\n(except when I was courting her), it had seemed to my feelings to be\nalmost a levity to go fiddling. Also I knew what everybody would begin\nto say of me; but the landlord, foreseeing a large attendance after the\nCoroner\'s inquest, would not for a moment hear of any breach of my\nfiddle pledge.\n\nHalf of Newton, and perhaps all Nottage, went to Sker the following day\nto see the Coroner, and to give him the benefit of their opinions. And\nanother piece of luck there was to tempt them in that direction. For the\nship which had been wrecked and had disappeared for a certain time, in a\nmost atrocious manner, was rolled about so by the tide and a shift of\nthe wind on Monday, that a precious large piece of her stern was in\nsight from the shore on Tuesday morning. It lay not more than a cable\'s\nlength from low-water mark, and was heaved up so that we could see as\nfar as the starboard mizzen-chains. Part of the taffrail was carried\naway, and the carving gone entirely, but the transom and transom-knees\nstood firm; and of the ship\'s name done in gold I could make out in\nlarge letters TA LUCIA; and underneath, in a curve, and in smaller\nletters, ADOR.\n\nOf course no one except myself could make head or tail of this; but\nafter thinking a little while, I was pretty sure of the meaning of\nit--namely, that the craft was Portuguese, called the Santa Lucia, and\ntrading from San Salvador, the capital of Brazils. And in this opinion I\nwas confirmed by observing through my spy-glass, copper bolt-heads of a\npattern such as I had seen at Lisbon, but never in any British ship.\nHowever, I resolved, for the present, to keep my opinion to myself,\nunless it were demanded upon good authority. For it made me feel\nconfused in mind, and perhaps a little uneasy, when, being struck by\nsome resemblance, I pulled from the lining of my hat a leaf of a book,\nupon which I copied all that could be made out of the letters, each side\nof the tiller of my new boat; and now I found them to be these,--UC from\nthe starboard side, just where they would have stood in Lucia--and DOR\nfrom the further end of the line, just as in San Salvador.\n\nThe sands were all alive with people, and the rocks, and every place\nwhere anything good might have drifted. For Evan Thomas could scarcely\ncome at a time of such affliction to assert his claims of wreck, and to\nbelabour right and left. Therefore, for a mile or more, from where the\nland begins to dip, and the old stone wall, like a jagged cord, divides\nour parish from Kenfig, hundreds of figures might be seen, running along\nthe grey wet sands, and reflected by their brightness. The day was going\nfor two of the clock, and the tide growing near to the turn of ebb; and\nthe landsprings oozing down from the beach, spread the whole of the flat\nsands so, with a silver overlaying, that without keen sight it was hard\nto tell where the shore ended and sea began. And a great part of this\nspace was sprinkled with naked feet going pattering--boys and girls, and\nyoung women and men, who had left their shoes up high on the rocks to\nhave better chance in the racing.\n\nNow it is not for me to say that all or half of these good people were\nso brisk because they expected any fine thing for themselves. I would\nnot even describe them as waiting in readiness for the force of fortune\nby the sea administered. I believe that all were most desirous of doing\ngood, if possible. In the first case, to the poor people drowned; but if\ntoo late, then to console any disconsolate relations: failing of which,\nit would be hard if anybody should blame them for picking up something\nfor themselves.\n\n""What! you here, mother Probyn?"" I cried, coming upon a most pious old\nwoman, who led the groaning at Zoar Chapel, and being for the moment\nstruck out of all my manners by sight of her.\n\n""Indeed, and so I am, old Davy,"" she answered, without abashment, and\nalmost too busy to notice me; ""the Lord may bless my poor endeavours to\nrescue them poor Injuns. But I can\'t get on without a rake. If I had\nonly had the sense to bring my garden-rake. There are so many little\nthings, scarcely as big as cockleshells; and the waves do drag them away\nfrom me. Oh, there, and there goes another! Gwenny, if I don\'t smack\nyou!""\n\nAll these people, and all their doings, I left with a sort of contempt,\nperhaps, such as breaks out on me now and then at any very great\nlittleness. And I knew that nothing worth wet of the knees could be\nfound with the ebb-tide running, and ere the hold of the ship broke up.\n\nSo I went toward the great house, whose sorrows and whose desolation\nthey took little heed of. And nothing made me feel more sad--strange as\nit may seem, and was--than to think of poor black Evan, thus unable to\nstand up and fight for his unrighteous rights.\n\nIn the great hall were six bodies, five of strong young men laid quiet,\neach in his several coffin; and the other of a little child in a simple\ndress of white, stretched upon a piece of board. Death I have seen in\nall his manners, since I was a cabin-boy, and I took my hat off to the\nbodies, as I had seen them do abroad; but when I saw the small dead\nchild, a thrill and pang of cold went through me. I made sure of nothing\nelse, except that it was dear Bardie. That little darling whom I loved,\nfor her gifts direct from God, and her ways, so out of the way to all\nother children--it struck my heart with a power of death, that here this\nlively soul was dead.\n\nWhen a man makes a fool of himself, anybody may laugh at him; and this\ndoes him good, perhaps, and hardens him against more trouble. But bad as\nI am, and sharp as I am, in other people\'s opinion (and proud sometimes\nto think of it), I could not help a good gulp of a tear, over what I\nbelieved to be the body of poor little Bardie. For that child had such\nnice ways, and took such upper hand of me; that, expecting to find a\nCaptain always, especially among women----\n\n""Old Davy, I \'ants \'a. Old Davy, \'hen is \'a coming?""\n\nBy the union-jack, it was as good as a dozen kegs of rum to me. There\nwas no mistaking the sweetest and clearest voice ever heard outside of a\nflute. And presently began pit-pat of the prettiest feet ever put in a\nshoe, down the great oak staircase. She held on by the rails, and showed\nno fear at all about it, though the least slip might have killed her.\nThen she saw the sad black sight after she turned the corner, and\nwondered at the meaning of it, and her little heart stood still. As she\nturned to me in awe, and held out both hands quivering, I caught her\nup, and spread my grey beard over her young frightened eyes, and took\nher out of sight of all those cold and very dreadful things.\n\nI had never been up the stairs before in that dark and ancient house;\nand the length, and the width, and the dreariness, and the creaking\nnoises, frightened me; not so much for my own sake (being never required\nto sleep there), but for the tender little creature, full already of\ntimid fancies, who must spend the dark nights there. And now the house,\nleft empty of its noise, and strength, and boastfulness, had only five\nmore ghosts to wander silent through the silent places. And this they\nbegan the very night after their bodies were in the churchyard.\n\nThe Coroner came on an old white pony, nearly four hours after the time\nfor which his clerk had ordered us. Being used, for my part, to royal\ndiscipline, and everything done to the minute fixed, with the captain\'s\nvoice like the crack of a gun, I was vexed and surprised; but expected\nhim to give us some reason, good or bad. Instead of that he roared out\nto us, with his feet still in both stirrups, ""Is there none of you\nTaffies with manners enough to come and hold a gentleman\'s horse? Here\nyou, Davy Jones, you are long enough, and lazy enough; put your hand to\nthe bridle, will you?""\n\nThis was to me, who was standing by, in the very height of innocence,\nhaving never yet seen any man appointed to sit upon dead bodies, and\ndesiring to know how he could help them. I did for his Honour all I\ncould, although his manner of speech was not in any way to my liking.\nBut my rule has always been that of the royal navy, than which there is\nno wiser. If my equal insults me, I knock him down; if my officer does\nit, I knock under.\n\nMeanwhile our people were muttering ""Sassenach, Sassenach!"" And from\ntheir faces it was plain that they did not like an Englishman to sit\nupon Cymric bodies. However, it was the old, old thing. The Welsh must\ndo all the real work; and the English be paid for sitting upon them\nafter they are dead.\n\n""I never sate on a black man yet, and I won\'t sit on a black man now,""\nthe Coroner said, when he was sure about oats enough for his pony; ""I\'ll\nnot disgrace his Majesty\'s writ by sitting upon damned niggers.""\n\n""Glory be to God, your Honour!"" Stradling Williams cried, who had come\nas head of the jury: clerk he was of Newton Church, and could get no\nfees unless upon a Christian burial: ""we thought your Honour would\nhardly put so great a disgrace upon us; but we knew not how the law\nlay.""\n\n""The law requires no Christian man,"" pronounced the Crowner, that all\nmight hear, ""to touch pitch, and defile himself. Both in body and soul,\nMaster Clerk, to lower and defile himself!""\n\nHereupon a high hard screech, which is all we have in Wales for the\nbrave hurrah of Englishmen, showed that all the jury were of one accord\nwith the Coroner: and I was told by somebody that all had shaken hands,\nand sworn to strike work, rather than put up with misery of conscience.\n\n""But, your Honour,"" said Mr Lewis, bailiff to Colonel Lougher, ""if we\nhold no quest on the black men, how shall we certify anything about this\nterrible shipwreck?""\n\n""The wreck is no concern of mine,"" answered the Crowner, crustily: ""it\nis not my place to sit upon planks, but upon Christian bodies. Do you\nattend to your own business, and leave mine to me, sir.""\n\nThe bailiff, being a nice quiet man, thought it best to say no more. But\nsome of the people who were thronging from every direction to see his\nHonour, told him about the little white baby found among the\nbladder-weed. He listened to this, and then he said,--\n\n""Show me this little white infant discovered among the black men. My\nbusiness here is not with infants, but with five young smothered men.\nHowever, if there be an infant of another accident, and of Christian\ncolour, I will take it as a separate case, and damn the county in the\nfees.""\n\nWe assured his lordship, as every one now began to call him (in virtue\nof his swearing so, which no doubt was right in a man empowered to make\nother people swear), we did our best at any rate to convince the\nCrowner, that over and above all black men, there verily was a little\nchild, and, for all one could tell, a Christian child, entitled to the\nchurchyard, and good enough for him to sit on. And so he entered the\nhouse to see it.\n\nBut if he had sworn a little before (and more than I durst set down for\nhim), he certainly swore a great deal now, and poured upon us a bitter\nheat of English indignation. All of the jury were taken aback; and I as\na witness felt most uneasy; until we came to understand that his\nHonour\'s wrath was justly kindled on account of some marks on the baby\'s\nclothes.\n\n""A coronet!"" he cried, stamping about; ""a coronet on my young lord\'s\npinafore, and you stupid oafs never told me!""\n\nNobody knew except myself (who had sailed with an earl for a captain)\nwhat the meaning of this thing was; and when the clerk of the church was\nasked, rather than own his ignorance, he said it was part of the arms of\nthe crown; and the Crowner was bound like a seal by it.\n\nThis explanation satisfied all the people of the parish, except a few\nfar-going Baptists, with whom it was a point of faith always to cavil\nand sneer at every ""wind of doctrine"" as they always called it--the\nscent of which could be traced, anyhow, to either the parson or the\nclerk, or even the gravedigger. But I was content to look on and say\nnothing, having fish to sell, at least twice a-week, and finding all\ncustomers orthodox, until they utter bad shillings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EVIDENCE.\n\n\nThere is no need for me to follow all the Crowner\'s doings, or all that\nthe juries thought and said, which was different altogether from what\nthey meant to think and say. And he found himself bound to have two of\nthem, with first right of inquest to the baby because of the stamp on\nhis pinafore. And here I was, foreman of the jury, with fifteenpence for\nmy services, and would gladly have served on the other jury after\nwalking all that way, but was disabled for doing so, and only got\nninepence for testimony. With that, however, I need not meddle, as every\none knows all about it; only, to make clear all that happened, and,\nindeed, to clear myself, I am forced to put before you all that we did\nabout that baby, as fully and emphatically as the state of our doings\nupon that occasion permitted me to remember it.\n\nFor the Coroner sate at the head of the table, in the great parlour of\nthe house; and the dead child came in on his board, and we all regarded\nhim carefully, especially heeding his coronet mark, and then set him by\nthe window. A fine young boy enough to look at, about the age of our\nBardie, and might have been her twin-brother, as everybody vowed he was,\nonly his face was bolder and stronger, and his nose quite different,\nand altogether a brave young chap, instead of funny and delicate. All\nthis, however, might well have come from knocking about in the sea so\nmuch.\n\nI would have given a good half-crown to have bitten off my foolish\ntongue, when one of the jurymen stood up and began to address the\nCoroner. He spoke, unluckily, very good English, and his Honour was glad\nto pay heed to him. And the clerk put down nearly all he said, word for\nword, as might be. This meddlesome fellow (being no less than brother\nHezekiah\'s self) nodded to me for leave to speak, which I could not deny\nhim; and his Honour lost no time whatever to put his mouth into his\nrummer of punch, as now provided for all of us, and to bow (whenever his\nmouth was empty) to that Hezekiah. For the man had won some reputation,\nor rather had made it, for himself, by perpetual talking, as if he were\nskilled in the history and antiquities of the neighbourhood. Of these he\nmade so rare a patchwork, heads and tails, prose, verse, and proverbs,\nhistories, and his stories, that (as I heard from a man of real teaching\nand learning who met him once and kept out of his way ever after) any\none trusting him might sit down in the chair of Canute at King Arthur\'s\ntable. Not that I or any of my neighbours would be the worse for doing\nthat; only the thought of it frightened us, and made us unwilling to\nhearken him much.\n\nHowever, if there was any matter on which Hezekiah deserved to be heard,\nno doubt it was this upon which he was now delivering his opinions--to\nwit, the great inroad or invasion of the sand, for miles along our\ncoast; of which there are very strange things to tell, and of which he\nhad made an especial study, having a field at Candleston with a shed\nupon it and a rick of hay, all which disappeared in a single night, and\nnone was ever seen afterwards. It was the only field he had, being left\nto him by his grandmother; and many people were disappointed that he had\nnot slept with his cow that night. This directed his attention to the\nserious consideration, as he always told us at first start, being a\nlover of three-decked words, of the most important contemplation which\ncould occupy the attention of any Cambrian landowner.\n\n""Show your land,"" cried a wag of a tailor, with none to cross his legs\nupon; but we put him down, and pegged him down, till his manners should\nbe of the pattern-book. Hezekiah went on to tell, in words too long to\nanswer the helm of such a plain sailor as I am, how the sweep of\nhundreds of miles of sand had come up from the west and south-west in\nonly two hundred and fifty years. How it had first begun to flow about\nthe Scilly Islands, as mentioned by one Borlase, and came to the mouth\nof Hayle river, in Cornwall, in the early years of King Henry VIII., and\nafter that blocked up Bude Haven, and swallowed the ploughs in the\narable land. Then at Llanant it came like a cloud over the moon one\nwinter night, and buried five-and-thirty houses with the people in them.\n\nAn Act of Parliament was passed--chapter the second of Philip and\nMary--to keep it out of Glamorganshire; and good commissioners were\nappointed, and a survey made along the coast, especially of Kenfig.\nNevertheless the dash of sand was scarcely on their ink, when swarming,\ndriving, darkening the air, the storm swept on their survey. At the\nmouths of the Tawey and Afan rivers the two sailors\' chapels were\nburied, and then it swept up the great Roman road, a branch of the\nJulian way, and smothered the pillars of Gordian, and swallowed the\ncastle of Kenfig, which stood by the side of the western road; and still\nrushing eastward, took Newton village and Newton old church beneath it.\nAnd so it went on for two hundred years, coming up from the sea, no\ndoubt, carried by the perpetual gales, which always are from the south\nand west--filling all the hollow places, changing all bright mossy pools\ninto hills of yellow drought, and, like a great encampment, dwelling\nover miles and leagues of land. And like a camp it was in this, that it\nwas always striking tent. Six times in the last few years had the\nhighest peak of sand--the general\'s tent it might be called--been\nshifted miles away, perhaps, and then come back towards Ogmore; and it\nwas only the other day that, through some shift or swirl of wind, a\nwindmill, with its sails entire, had been laid bare near Candleston, of\nwhich the last record was in Court-rolls of a hundred and fifty years\nagone.[A]\n\nNow all this, though Hezekiah said it, was true enough, I do believe,\nhaving heard things much to the same purpose from my own old\ngrandfather. The Coroner listened with more patience than we had given\nhim credit for, although he told us that brother Perkins should have\nreserved his learned speech for the second inquiry, which was to be\nabout the deaths of the five young men; for to him it appeared that\nthis noble infant must lay the blame of his grievous loss not on the\nsand but upon the sea. Hezekiah replied, with great deference, that the\ncause in both cases was the same, for that the movement of sand went\non under the sea even more than ashore, and hence the fatal gulfing of\nthat ship, the Andalusia, and the loss of his young lordship.\n\nThe name he had given the ship surprised me; and indeed I felt sure that\nit was quite wrong; and so I said immediately, without any low\nconsideration of what might be mine own interest. But the Coroner would\nnot hearken to me, being much impressed now with the learning and wisdom\nof Hezekiah Perkins. And when Hezekiah presented his card, beginning\nwith ""horologist,"" and ending with the ""king and queen,"" he might have\nhad any verdict he liked, if he himself had been upon trial.\n\nTherefore, after calling in (for the sake of form) the two poor women\nwho found the dead baby among the sea-weed, and had sevenpence apiece\nfor doing so, and who cried all the while that they talked in Welsh\n(each having seen a dear baby like him not more than twenty years ago),\nwe came in the most unanimous manner, under his lordship\'s guidance, to\nthe following excellent verdict:--\n\n""Found drowned on Pool Tavan rocks, a man-child, supposed to be two\nyears old; believed to be a young nobleman, from marks on pinafore, and\nhigh bearing; but cast away by a storm of sand from the ship Andalusia\nof Appledore.""\n\nNow I was as certain, as sure could be, that half of this verdict must\nbe wrong; especially as to the name of the ship, and her belonging to\nAppledore, which never yet owned any craft of more than 200 tons at the\nutmost--a snow, or a brig at the very outside. Nevertheless I was\ncompelled to give in to the rest of them, and most of all to the\nCoroner. Only I said, as many who are still alive can remember, and are\nnot afraid to speak to, and especially my good friend Mr Lewis, ""The\nship was not called the Andalusia; the ship was never from Appledore;\nneither was she of British build. As an old seaman, it is likely that I\nknow more of the build of a ship than a lubber of a clock-maker, or\nrather a clock-mauler.""\n\nBut here I was put down sternly; and hearing of verdicts a great deal\nworse, without any mischief come of them, I was even content to sign the\nreturn, and have a new pipe of bird\'s-eye. And a bird\'s-eye view this\ngave me of them at the second inquest wherein I had to give evidence;\nand was not of the jury. They wanted to cross-examine me, because I had\nbeen unpleasant, but of that they got the worst, and dropped it. But as\nall our jurymen declared upon their oaths that the little nobleman was\ndrowned in a storm of sand, so they found that the five young rabbiters\ncame to their end of smothering through a violent sea-tempest.\n\nIn the days of my youth such judgments perhaps would have tried my\npatience; but now I knew that nothing ever follows truth and justice.\nPeople talk of both these things, and perhaps the idea does them good.\n\nBe that according to God\'s will--as we always say when deprived of our\nown--at any rate, I am bound to tell one little thing more about each\nquest. And first about the first one. Why was I so vexed and angry with\nmy foolish tongue when Hezekiah began to speak? Only because I knew full\nwell that it would lead to the very thing, which it was my one desire to\navoid, if possible. And this--as you may guess at once, after what\nhappened on the stairs--was the rude fetching and exposing of the dear\nlittle maid among so many common fellows; and to show her the\nbaby-corpse. I feared that it must come to this, through my own\nthoughtless blabbing about her ""ickle bother"" in the presence of\nHezekiah: and if ever man had a hollow dry heart from over-pumping of\nthe tongue, I had it when Hezekiah came in; bearing, in a depth of\nfright and wonder, and contempt of him, my own delicate Bardie. I had\nset my back against the door, and sworn that they should not have her;\nbut crafty Perkins had stolen out by another door while they humoured\nme. Now my pretty dear was awed, and hushed beyond all crying, and even\ncould not move her feet, as children do, in a kicking way. Trying to get\nas far as possible from Hezekiah\'s nasty face--which gave me a great\ndeal of pleasure, because she had never done the like to me, unless I\nwere full of tobacco--she stretched away from his greasy shoulder, and\nthen she saw old Davy. Her hands came toward me, and so did her eyes,\nand so did her lips, with great promise of kisses, such as her father\nand mother perhaps might have been mightily tempted by; but nobody now\nto care for them.\n\nWhen Hezekiah, pretending to dandle this little lady in a jaunty way,\nlike one of his filthy low children, was taking her towards that poor\nlittle corpse, so white in the light of the window; and when he made\nher look at it, and said, ""Is that ickle bother, my dear?"" and she all\nthe time was shivering and turning her eyes away from it, and seeking\nfor me to help her, I got rid of the two men who held me, nor hearkened\nI the Coroner, but gave Hezekiah such a grip as he felt for three months\nafterwards, and with Bardie on my left arm, kept my right fist ready.\n\nNobody cared to encounter this; for I had happened to tell the\nneighbourhood how the Frenchman\'s head came off at the time when he\ntried to injure me; and so I bore off the little one, till her chest\nbegan to pant and her tears ran down my beard. And then as I spoke\nsoftly to her and began to raise her fingers, and to tickle her frizzy\nhair, all of a sudden she flung both arms around my neck, and loved me.\n\n""Old Davy, poor ickle Bardie not go to \'e back pit-hole yet?""\n\n""No, my dear, not for ever so long. Not for eighty years at least. And\nthen go straight to heaven!""\n\n""Ickle bother go to \'e back pit-hole? Does \'a think, old Davy?""\n\nThis was more than I could tell, though inclined to think it very\nlikely. However, before I could answer, some of the jury followed us,\nand behind them the Coroner himself; they insisted on putting a question\nto her, and so long as they did not force her again to look at that\nwhich terrified her, I had no right to prevent them. They all desired to\nspeak at once; but the clerk of the Coroner took the lead, having as yet\nperformed no work toward the earning of his salt or rum. An innocent old\nman he was, but very free from cleanliness; and the child being most\nparticular of all ever born in that matter, turned away with her mite of\na nose, in a manner indescribable.\n\nHe was much too dull to notice this; but putting back his spectacles,\nand stooping over her hair and ears (which was all she left outside my\nbeard), he wanted to show his skill in babies, of which he boasted\nhimself a grandfather. And so he began to whisper,--\n\n""My little dear, you will be a good child--a very good child; won\'t you,\nnow? I can see it in your little face. Such a pretty dear you are! And\nall good children always do as they are told, you know. We want you to\ntell us a little thing about pretty little brother. I have got a little\ngirl at home not so old as you are, and she is so clever, you can\'t\nthink. Everything she does and says; everything we tell her----""\n\n""Take ayay \'e nasty old man. Take ayay \'e bad old man; or I never tis \'a\nagain, old Davy.""\n\nShe flashed up at me with such wrath, that I was forced to obey her;\nwhile the old man put down his goggles to stare, and all the jury\nlaughed at him. And I was running away with her, for her little breath\nwas hot and short; when the Coroner called out, ""Stop, man; I know how\nto manage her."" At this I was bound to pull up, and set her to look at\nhim, as he ordered me. She sate well up in my arms, and looked, and\nseemed not to think very highly of him.\n\n""Look at his Honour, my dear,"" said I, stroking her hair as I knew she\nliked; ""look at his lordship, you pretty duck.""\n\n""Little child,"" began his Honour, ""you have a duty to perform, even at\nthis early period of your very beginning life. We are most desirous to\nspare your feelings, having strong reasons to believe that you are\nsprung from a noble family. But in our duty towards your lineage, we\nmust require you, my little dear--we must request you, my little\nlady--to assist us in our endeavour to identify----""\n\n""I can say \'dentify,\' old Davy; tell \'e silly old man to say \'dentify\'\nsame as I does.""\n\nShe spread her little open hand with such contempt at the Coroner, that\neven his own clerk could not keep his countenance from laughing. And his\nHonour, having good reason to think her a baby of high position before,\nwas now so certain that he said, ""God bless her! What a child she is!\nTake her away, old mariner. She is used to high society.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA VERDICT ON THE JURY.\n\n\nAs to the second inquest, I promised (as you may remember) to tell\nsomething also. But in serious truth, if I saw a chance to escape it,\nwithout skulking watch, I would liefer be anywhere else almost--except\nin a French prison.\n\nAfter recording with much satisfaction our verdict upon Bardie\'s\nbrother--which nearly all of us were certain that the little boy must\nbe--the Coroner bade his second jury to view the bodies of the five\nyoung men. These were in the great dark hall, set as in a place of\nhonour, and poor young Watkin left to mind them; and very pale and ill\nhe looked.\n\n""If you please, sir, they are all stretched out, and I am not afraid of\nthem;"" he said to me, as I went to console him: ""father cannot look at\nthem; but mother and I are not afraid. They are placed according to\ntheir ages, face after face, and foot after foot. And I am sure they\nnever meant it, sir, when they used to kick me out of bed: and\noftentimes I deserved it.""\n\nI thought much less of those five great corpses than of the gentle and\nloving boy who had girt up his heart to conquer fear, and who tried to\nthink evil of himself for the comforting of his brethren\'s souls.\n\nBut he nearly broke down when the jurymen came; and I begged them to\nspare him the pain and trial of going before the Coroner to identify the\nbodies, which I could do, as well as any one; and to this they all\nagreed.\n\nWhen we returned to the long oak parlour, we found that the dignity of\nthe house was maintained in a way which astonished us. There had been\nsome little refreshment before, especially for his Honour; but now all\nthese things were cleared away, and the table was spread with a noble\nsight of glasses, and bottles, and silver implements, fit for the mess\nof an admiral. Neither were these meant for show alone, inasmuch as to\nmake them useful, there was water cold and water hot, also lemons, and\nsugar, and nutmeg, and a great black George of ale, a row of pipes, and\na jar of tobacco, also a middling keg of Hollands, and an anker of old\nrum. At first we could hardly believe our eyes, knowing how poor and\ndesolate, both of food and furniture, that old grange had always been.\nBut presently one of us happened to guess, and Hezekiah confirmed it,\nthat the lord of the manor had taken compassion upon his afflicted\ntenant, and had furnished these things in a handsome manner, from his\nown great house some five miles distant. But in spite of the custom of\nthe country, I was for keeping away from it all, upon so sad an\noccasion. And one or two more were for holding aloof, although they cast\nsheep\'s-eyes at it.\n\nHowever, the Crowner rubbed his hands, and sate down at the top of the\ntable, and then the foreman sate down also, and said that, being so much\nupset, he was half inclined to take a glass of something weak. He was\nrecommended, if he felt like that, whatever he did, not to take it weak,\nbut to think of his wife and family; for who could say what such a turn\nmight lead to, if neglected? And this reflection had such weight, that\ninstead of mixing for himself, he allowed a friend to mix for him.\n\nThe Crowner said, ""Now, gentlemen, in the presence of such fearful\ntrouble and heavy blows from Providence, no man has any right to give\nthe rein to his own feelings. It is his duty, as a man, to control his\nsad emotions; and his duty, as a family-man, to attend to his\nconstitution."" With these words he lit a pipe, and poured himself a\nglass of Hollands, looking sadly upward, so that the measure quite\nescaped him. ""Gentlemen of the jury,"" he continued with such authority,\nthat the jury were almost ready to think that they must have begun to be\ngentlemen--till they looked at one another; ""gentlemen of the jury, life\nis short, and trouble long. I have sate upon hundreds of poor people who\ndestroyed themselves by nothing else than want of self-preservation. I\nhave made it my duty officially to discourage such shortcomings. Mr\nForeman, be good enough to send the lemons this way; and when ready for\nbusiness, say so.""\n\nCrowner Bowles was now as pleasant as he had been grumpy in the morning;\nand finding him so, we did our best to keep him in that humour. Neither\nwas it long before he expressed himself in terms which were an honour\nalike to his heart and head. For he told us, in so many words--though I\nwas not of the jury now, nevertheless I held on to them, and having been\nforeman just now, could not be, for a matter of form, when it came to\nglasses, cold-shouldered,--worthy Crowner Bowles, I say, before he had\nstirred many slices of lemon, told us all, in so many words--and the\nmore, the more we were pleased with them--that for a thoroughly honest,\nintelligent, and hard-working jury, commend him henceforth and as long\nas he held his Majesty\'s sign-manual, to a jury made of Newton parish\nand of Kenfig burgesses!\n\nWe drank his health with bumpers round, every man upon his legs, and\nthen three cheers for his lordship; until his clerk, who was rather\nsober, put his thumb up, and said ""Stop."" And from the way he went on\njerking with his narrow shoulders, we saw that he would recall our\nthoughts to the hall that had no door to it. Then following his looks,\nwe saw the distance of the silence.\n\nThis took us all aback so much, that we had in the witnesses--of whom I\nthe head man was there already--and for fear of their being nervous, and\nso confusing testimony, gave them a cordial after swearing. Everybody\nknew exactly what each one of them had to say. But it would have been\nvery hard, and might have done them an injury, not to let them say it.\n\nThe Coroner, having found no need to charge (except his rummer), left\nhis men for a little while to deliberate their verdict.\n\n""Visitation of God, of course it must be,"" Stradling Williams began to\nsay; ""visitation of Almighty God.""\n\nSome of the jury took the pipes out of their mouths and nodded at him,\nwhile they blew a ring of smoke; and others nodded without that trouble;\nand all seemed going pleasantly. When suddenly a little fellow, whose\nname was Simon Edwards, a brother of the primitive Christians, or at\nleast of their minister, being made pugnacious by ardent spirits, rose,\nand holding the arm of his chair, thus delivered his sentiments;\nspeaking, of course, in his native tongue.\n\n""Head-man, and brothers of the jury, I-I-I do altogether refuse and deny\nthe goodness of that judgment. The only judgment I will certify is in\nthe lining of my hat,--\'Judgment of Almighty God, for rabbiting on the\nSabbath-day.\' Hezekiah Perkins, I call upon thee, as a brother\nChristian, and a consistent member, to stand on the side of the Lord\nwith me.""\n\nHis power of standing on any side was by this time, however, exhausted;\nand falling into his chair he turned pale, and shrunk to the very back\nof it. For over against him stood Evan Thomas, whom none of us had seen\ntill then. It was a sight that sobered us, and made the blood fly from\nour cheeks, and forced us to set down the glass.\n\nThe face of black Evan was ashy grey, and his heavy square shoulders\nslouching forward, and his hands hung by his side. Only his deep eyes\nshone without moving; and Simon backed further and further away, without\nany power to gaze elsewhere. Then Evan Thomas turned from him, without\nany word, or so much as a sigh, and looked at us all; and no man had\npower to meet the cold quietness of his regard. And not having thought\nmuch about his troubles, we had nothing at all to say to him.\n\nAfter waiting for us to begin, and finding no one ready, he spake a few\nwords to us all in Welsh, and the tone of his voice seemed different.\n\n""Noble gentlemen, I am proud that my poor hospitality pleases you. Make\nthe most of the time God gives; for six of you have seen the white\nhorse."" With these words he bowed his head, and left us shuddering in\nthe midst of all the heat of cordials. For it is known that men, when\nprostrate by a crushing act of God, have the power to foresee the death\nof other men that feel no pity for them. And to see the white horse on\nthe night of new moon, even through closed eyelids, and without sense of\nvision, is the surest sign of all sure signs of death within the\ntwelvemonth. Therefore all the jury sate glowering at one another, each\nman ready to make oath that Evan\'s eyes were not on him.\n\nNow there are things beyond our knowledge, or right of explanation, in\nwhich I have a pure true faith--for instance, the ""Flying Dutchman,""\nwhom I had twice beheld already, and whom no man may three times see,\nand then survive the twelvemonth; in him, of course, I had true\nfaith--for what can be clearer than eyesight? Many things, too, which\nbrave seamen have beheld, and can declare; but as for landsmen\'s\nsuperstitions, I scarcely cared to laugh at them. However, strange\nenough it is, all black Evan said came true. Simon Edwards first went\noff, by falling into Newton Wayn, after keeping it up too late at\nchapel. And after him the other five, all within the twelvemonth; some\nin their beds, and some abroad, but all gone to their last account. And\nheartily glad I was for my part (as one after other they dropped off\nthus), not to have served on that second jury; and heartily sorry I was\nalso that brother Hezekiah had not taken the luck to behold the white\nhorse.\n\nPlain enough it will be now, to any one who knows our parts, that after\nwhat Evan Thomas said, and the way in which he withdrew from us, the\nonly desire the jury had was to gratify him with their verdict, and to\nhasten home, ere the dark should fall, and no man to walk by himself on\nthe road. Accordingly, without more tobacco, though some took another\nglass for strength, they returned the following verdict:--\n\n""We find that these five young and excellent men""--here came their\nnames, with a Mister to each--""were lost on their way to a place of\nworship, by means of a violent storm of the sea. And the jury cannot\nseparate without offering their heartfelt pity""--the Crowner\'s clerk\nchanged it to \'sympathy\'--""to their bereaved and affectionate parents.\nGod save the King!""\n\nAfter this, they all went home; and it took good legs to keep up with\nthem along ""Priest Lane,"" in some of the darker places, and especially\nwhere a white cow came, and looked over a gate for the milking-time. I\ncould not help laughing, although myself not wholly free from\nuneasiness; and I grieved that my joints were not as nimble as those of\nSimon Edwards.\n\nBut while we frightened one another, like so many children, each\nperceiving something which was worse to those who perceived it not,\nHezekiah carried on as if we were a set of fools, and nothing ever could\nfrighten him. To me, who was the bravest of them, this was very irksome;\nbut it happened that I knew brother Perkins\'s pet belief. His wife had\nlived at Longlands once, a lonely house between Nottage and Newton, on\nthe rise of a little hill. And they say that on one night of the year,\nall the funerals that must pass from Nottage to Newton in the\ntwelvemonth, go by in succession there, with all the mourners after\nthem, and the very hymns that they will sing passing softly on the wind.\n\nSo as we were just by Longlands in the early beat of the stars, I\nmanaged to be at Perkins\'s side. Then suddenly, as a bat went by, I\ncaught the arm of Hezekiah, and drew back, and shivered.\n\n""Name of God, Davy! what\'s the matter?""\n\n""Can\'t you see them, you blind-eye? There they go! there they\ngo! All the coffins with palls to them. And the names upon the\nhead-plates:--Evan, and Thomas, and Hopkin, and Rees, and Jenkin, with\nonly four bearers! And the psalm they sing is the thirty-fourth.""\n\n""So it is! I can see them all. The Lord have mercy upon my soul! Oh\nDavy, Davy! don\'t leave me here.""\n\nHe could not walk another step, but staggered against the wall and\ngroaned, and hid his face inside his hat. We got him to Newton with much\nado; but as for going to Bridgend that night, he found that our\nchurch-clock must be seen to, the very first thing in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTRUTH LIES SOMETIMES IN A WELL.\n\n\nThe following morning it happened so that I did not get up over early;\nnot, I assure you, from any undue enjoyment of the grand Crowner\'s\nquests; but partly because the tide for fishing would not suit till the\nafternoon, and partly because I had worked both hard and long at the\n""Jolly Sailors:"" and this in fulfilment of a pledge from which there was\nno escaping, when I promised on the night before to grease and tune my\nviolin, and display the true practice of hornpipe. Rash enough this\npromise was, on account of my dear wife\'s memory, and the things bad\npeople would say of it. And but for the sad uneasiness created by black\nEvan\'s prophecy, and the need of lively company to prevent my seeing\nwhite horses, the fear of the parish might have prevailed with me over\nall fear of the landlord. Hence I began rather shyly; but when my first\ntune had been received with hearty applause from all the room, how could\nI allow myself to be clapped on the back, and then be lazy?\n\nNow Bunny was tugging and clamouring for her bit of breakfast, almost\nbefore I was wide-awake, when the latch of my cottage-door was lifted,\nand in walked Hezekiah. Almost any other man would have been more\nwelcome; for though he had not spoken of it on the day before, he was\nsure to annoy me, sooner or later, about the fish he had forced me to\nsell him. When such a matter is over and done with, surely no man, in\ncommon-sense, has a right to reopen the question. The time to find fault\nwith a fish, in all conscience, is before you have bought him. Having\nonce done that, he is now your own; and to blame him is to find fault\nwith the mercy which gave you the money to buy him. A foolish thing as\nwell; because you are running down your own property, and spoiling your\nrelish for him. Conduct like this is below contempt; even more\nungraceful and ungracious than that of a man who spreads abroad the\nfaults of his own wife.\n\nHezekiah, however, on this occasion, was not quite so bad as that. His\nerrand, according to his lights, was of a friendly nature; for he pried\nall round my little room with an extremely sagacious leer, and then\ngazed at me with a dark cock of his eye, and glanced askance at Bunny,\nand managed to wink, like the Commodore\'s ship beginning to light\npoop-lanterns.\n\n""Speak out, like a man,"" I said; ""is your wife confined with a prophecy,\nor what is the matter with you?""\n\n""Hepzibah, the prophetess, is well; and her prophecies are abiding the\nfulness of their fulfilment. I would speak with you on a very secret and\nimportant matter, concerning also her revealings.""\n\n""Then I will send the child away. Here, Bunny, run and ask mother\nJones----""\n\n""That will not do; I will not speak here. Walls are thin, and walls have\nears. Come down to the well with me.""\n\n""But the well is a lump of walls,"" I answered, ""and children almost\nalways near it.""\n\n""There are no children. I have been down. The well is dry, and the\nchildren know it. No better place can be for speaking.""\n\nLooking down across the churchyard, I perceived that he was right; and\nso I left Bunny to dwell on her breakfast, and went with Hezekiah. Among\nthe sandhills there was no one; for fright had fallen on everybody,\nsince the sands began to walk, as the general folk now declared of them.\nAnd nobody looked at a sandhill now with any other feeling than towards\nhis grave and tombstone.\n\nEven my heart was a little heavy, in spite of all scientific points,\nwhen I straddled over the stone that led into the sandy passage. After\nme came Hezekiah, groping with his grimy hands, and calling out for me\nto stop, until he could have hold of me. However, I left him to follow\nthe darkness, in the wake of his own ideas.\n\nA better place for secret talk, in a parish full of echoes, scarcely\ncould be found, perhaps, except the old ""Red House"" on the shore. So I\nwaited for Perkins to unfold, as soon as we stood on the bottom step,\nwith three or four yards of quicksand, but no dip for a pitcher below\nus. The children knew that the well was dry, and some of them perhaps\nwere gone to try to learn their letters.\n\nWhat then was my disappointment, as it gradually came out, that so far\nfrom telling me a secret, Hezekiah\'s object was to deprive me of my own!\nHowever, if I say what happened, nobody can grumble.\n\nIn the first place, he manÅ\x93uvred much to get the weather-gage of me, by\nsetting me so that the light that slanted down the grey slope should\ngather itself upon my honest countenance. I for my part, as a man\nunwarned how far it might become a duty to avoid excess of accuracy,\ntook the liberty to prefer a less conspicuous position; not that I had\nany lies to tell, but might be glad to hear some. Therefore, I stuck to\na pleasant seat upon a very nice sandy slab, where the light so shot and\nwavered, that a badly inquisitive man might seek in vain for a flush or\na flickering of the most delicate light of all--that which is cast by\nthe heart or mind of man into the face of man.\n\nUpon the whole, it could scarcely be said, at least as concerned\nHezekiah, that truth was to be found, just now, at the bottom of this\nwell.\n\n""Dear brother Dyo,"" he gently began, with the most brotherly voice and\nmanner; ""it has pleased the Lord, who does all things aright, to send me\nto you for counsel now, as well as for comfort, beloved Dyo.""\n\n""All that I have is at your service,"" I answered very heartily; looking\nfor something about his wife, and always enjoying a thing of that kind\namong those righteous fellows; and we heard that Hepzibah had taken up,\nunder word of the Lord, with the Shakers.[B]\n\n""Brother David, I have wrestled hard in the night-season, about that\nwhich has come to pass. My wife----""\n\n""To be sure,"" I said.\n\n""My wife, who was certified seven times as a vessel for the Spirit----""\n\n""To be sure--they always are; and then they gad about so----""\n\n""Brother, you understand me not; or desire to think evil. Hepzibah,\nsince her last confinement, is a vessel for the Spirit to the square of\nwhat she was. Seven times seven is forty-nine, and requires no\ncertificate. But these are carnal calculations.""\n\nAll this took me beyond my depth, and I answered him rather crustily;\nand my word ended with both those letters which, as I learned from my\nCatechism, belong to us by baptism.\n\n""Unholy David, shun evil words. Pray without ceasing, but swear not at\nall. In a vision of the night, Hepzibah hath seen terrible things of\nthee.""\n\n""Why, you never went home last night, Hezekiah. How can you tell what\nyour wife dreamed?""\n\n""I said not when it came to pass. And how could I speak of it yesterday\nbefore that loose assembly?""\n\n""Well, well, out with it! What was this wonderful vision?""\n\n""Hepzibah, the prophetess, being in a trance, and deeply inspired of\nthe Lord, beheld the following vision: A long lonely sea was spread\nbefore her, shining in the moonlight smoothly, and in places strewed\nwith gold. A man was standing on a low black rock, casting a line, and\ndrawing great fish out almost every time he cast. Then there arose from\nout the water a dear little child all dressed in white, carrying with\nboth hands her cradle, and just like our little maiden, Martha----""\n\n""Like your dirty Martha indeed!"" I was at the very point of saying, but\nsnapped my lips, and saved myself.\n\n""This small damsel approached the fisherman, and presented her cradle to\nhim, with a very trustful smile. Then he said, \'Is it gold?\' And she\nsaid, \'No, it is only a white lily.\' Upon which he shouted, \'Be off with\nyou!\' And the child fell into a desolate hole, and groped about vainly\nfor her cradle. Then all the light faded out of the sea, and the waves\nand the rocks began moaning, and the fisherman fell on his knees, and\nsought in vain for the cradle. And while he was moaning, came Satan\nhimself, bearing the cradle red-hot and crackling; and he seized the\npoor man by his blue woollen smock, and laid him in the cradle, and\nrocked it, till his shrieks awoke Hepzibah. And Hepzibah is certain that\nyou are the man.""\n\nTo hear all this in that sudden manner quite took my breath away for a\nminute, so that I fell back and knocked my head, purely innocent as I\nwas. But presently I began to hope that the prophetess might be wrong\nthis time; and the more so because that vile trance of hers might have\ncome from excessive enjoyment of those good fish of mine. And it grew\nupon me more and more, the more I disliked her prediction about me, that\nif she had such inspiration, scarcely would she have sent Hezekiah to\nbuy her supper from my four-legged table. Therefore I spoke without much\nloss of courage.\n\n""Brother Hezekiah, there is something wrong with Hepzibah. Send her, I\npray you, to Dr Ap-Yollup before she prophesies anything more. No blue\nwoollen smock have I worn this summer, but a canvas jacket only, and\nmore often a striped jersey. It is Sandy Macraw she has seen in her\ndream, with the devil both roasting and rocking him. Glory be to the\nLord for it!""\n\n""Glory be to Him, Dyo, whichever of you two it was! I hope that it may\nhave been Sandy. But Hepzibah is always accurate, even among fishermen.""\n\n""Even fishermen,"" I answered (being a little touched with wrath), ""know\nthe folk that understood them, and the folk that cannot. Even fishermen\nhave their right, especially when reduced to it, not to be blasphemed in\nthat way, even by a prophetess.""\n\n""Dyo, you are hot again. What makes you go on so? A friend\'s advice is\nsuch a thing, that I nearly always take it; unless I find big obstacles.\nDyo, now be advised by me.""\n\n""That depends on how I like it,"" was the best thing I could say.\n\n""David Llewellyn, the only chance to save thy sinful soul is this. Open\nthine heart to the chosen one, to the favoured of the Lord. Confess to\nHepzibah the things that befell thee, and how the tempter prevailed with\nthee. Especially bring forth, my brother, the accursed thing thou hast\nhid in thy tent, the wedge of gold, and the shekels of silver, and the\nBabylonish garment. Thou hast stolen, and dissembled also; and put it\neven among thine own stuff. Cast it from thee, deliver it up, lay it\nbefore the ark of the Lord, and Hepzibah shall fall down and pray, lest\nthou be consumed and burnt with fire, like the son of Carmi the son of\nZabdi, and covered over with a great heap of stones, even such as this\nis.""\n\nMy wrath at this foul accusation, and daring attempt to frighten me, was\nkindled so that I could not speak; and if this had happened in the open\nair, I should have been certain to knock him down. However, I began to\nthink, for Perkins was a litigious fellow; and however strict a man\'s\nconduct is, he does not want his affairs all exposed. Therefore I kept\nmy knit knuckles at home, but justly felt strong indignation. Perkins\nthought he had terrified me, for perhaps in that bad light I looked\npale; and so he began to triumph upon me, which needs, as everybody\nknows, a better man than Hezekiah.\n\n""Come, come, brother Dyo,"" he said, in a voice quite different from the\nChapel-Scriptural style he had used; ""you see, we know all about it. Two\ndear children come ashore, one dead, and the other not dead. You\ncontrive to receive them both, with your accustomed poaching skill. For\neverybody says that you are always to be found everywhere, except in\nyour chapel, on Sabbath-day. Now, David, what do our good people, having\nfamilies of their own, find upon these children? Not so much as a chain,\nor locket, or even a gold pin. I am a jeweller, and I know that children\nof high position always have some trinket on them, when their mothers\nlove them. A child with a coronet, and no gold! David, this is wrong of\nwrong. And worse than this, you conceal the truth, even from me your\nancient friend. There must be a great deal to be made, either from those\nwho would hold them in trust, or from those in whose way they stood. For\nthe family died out, very likely, in all male inheritance. Think what we\nmight make of it, by acting under my direction. And you shall have half\nof it all, old Davy, by relieving your mind, and behaving in a sensible\nand religious manner.""\n\nThis came home to my sense of experience more than all Hepzibah\'s divine\npredictions or productions. At the same time I saw that Hezekiah was all\nabroad in the dark, and groping right and left after the bodily truth.\nAnd what call had he to cry shares with me, because he had more\nreputation, and a higher conceit of himself, of course? But it crossed\nmy mind that this nasty fellow, being perhaps in front of me in some\nlittle tricks of machinery, might be useful afterwards in getting at the\nreal truth, which often kept me awake at night. Only I was quite\nresolved not to encourage roguery, by letting him into partnership.\nPerceiving my depth of consideration--for it suited my purpose to hear\nhim out, and learn how much he suspected--it was natural that he should\ntry again to impress me yet further by boasting.\n\n""Dyo, I have been at a Latin school for as much as three months\ntogether. My father gave me a rare education, and I made the most of it.\nNone of your ignorance for me! I am up to the moods and the tenses, the\naccidents and the proselytes. The present I know, and the future I know;\nthe Peter-perfection, and the hay-roost----""\n\n""I call that stuff gibberish. Talk plain English if you can.""\n\n""Understand you then so much as this? I speak in a carnal manner now. I\nspeak as a fool unto a fool. I am up to snuff, good Dyo; I can tell the\ntime of day.""\n\n""Then you are a devilish deal cleverer than any of your clocks are. But\nnow thou speakest no parables, brother. Now I know what thou meanest.\nThou art up for robbing somebody; and if I would shun Satan\'s clutches,\nI must come and help thee.""\n\n""Dyo, this is inconsistent, nor can I call it brotherly. We wish to do\ngood, both you and I, and to raise a little money for works of love;\nyou, no doubt, with a good end in view, to console you for much\ntribulation; and I with a single eye to the advancement of the cause\nwhich I have at heart, to save many brands from the burning. Then, Dyo,\nwhy not act together? Why not help one another, dear brother; thou with\nthe good-luck, and I with the brains?""\n\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder kindly, with a yearning of his bowels\ntowards me, such as true Nonconformists feel at the scent of any money.\nI found myself also a little moved, not being certain how far it was\nwise to throw him altogether over.\n\nBut suddenly, by what means I know not, except the will of Providence,\nthere arose before me that foul wrong which the Nicodemus-Christian had\ncommitted against me some three years back. I had forborne to speak of\nit till now, wishing to give the man fair-play.\n\n""Hezekiah, do you remember,"" I asked, with much solemnity ""do you\nremember your twentieth wedding-day?""\n\n""Davy, my brother, how many times--never mind talking about that now.""\n\n""You had a large company coming, and to whom did you give a special\norder to catch you a turbot at tenpence a-pound?""\n\n""Nay, nay, my dear friend Dyo; shall I never get that thing out of your\nstupid head?""\n\n""You had known me for twenty years at least as the very best fisherman\non the coast, and a man that could be relied upon. Yet you must go and\ngive that order, not to a man of good Welsh blood--with ten Welshmen\ncoming to dinner, mind--not to a man that was bred and born within five\nmiles of your dirty house--not to a man that knew every cranny and\ncrinkle of sand where the turbots lie; but to a tag-rag Scotchman! It\nwas spoken of upon every pebble from Briton Ferry to Aberthaw. David\nLlewellyn put under the feet of a fellow like Sandy Macraw--a beggarly,\ninterloping, freckled, bitter weed of a Scotchman!""\n\n""Well, Davy, I have apologised. How many times more must I do it? It was\nnot that I doubted your skill. You tell us of that so often, that none\nof us ever question it. It was simply because--I feared just then to\ncome near your excellent and lamented----""\n\n""No excuses, no excuses, Mr Perkins, if you please! You only make the\nmatter worse. As if a man\'s wife could come into the question, when it\ncomes to business! Yours may, because you don\'t know how to manage her;\nbut mine----""\n\n""Well, now she is gone, Dyo; and very good she was to you, And in your\nheart, you know it.""\n\nWhether he said this roguishly, or from the feeling which all of us have\nwhen it comes to one another, I declare I knew not then, and I know not\neven now. For I did not feel so sharply up to look to mine own interest,\nwith these recollections over me. I waited for him to begin again, but\nhe seemed to stick back in the corner. And in spite of all that turbot\nbusiness, at the moment I could not help holding out my hand to him.\n\nHe took it, and shook it, with as much emotion as if he had truly been\nfond of my wife; and I felt that nothing more must be said concerning\nthat order to Sandy Macraw. It seemed to be very good reason also, for\ngetting out of that interview; for I might say things to be sorry for,\nif I allowed myself to go on any more with my heart so open. Therefore I\ncalled in my usual briskness, ""Lo, the water is rising! The children\nmust be at the mouth of the well. What will the good wife prophesy if\nshe sees thee coming up the stairs with thy two feet soaking wet, Master\nHezekiah?""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nFOR A LITTLE CHANGE OF AIR.\n\n\nOn the very next day, I received such a visit as never had come to my\nhouse before. For while I was trimming my hooks, and wondering how to\nget out of all this trouble with my conscience sound and my pocket\nimproved; suddenly I heard a voice not to be found anywhere.\n\n""I \'ants to yalk, I tell \'a, Yatkin. Put me down derekkerly. I \'ants to\nsee old Davy.""\n\n""And old Davy wants to see you, you beauty,"" I cried, as she jumped like\na little wild kid, and took all my house with a glance, and then me.\n\n""Does \'a know, I yikes this house, and I yikes \'a, and I yikes Yatkin,\nand ickle Bunny, and evelybody?""\n\nShe pointed all round for everybody, with all ten fingers spread\neveryway. Then Watkin came after her, like her slave, with a foolish\ngrin on his countenance, in spite of the undertaking business.\n\n""If you please, sir, Mr Llewellyn,"" he said, ""we was forced to bring her\nover; she have been crying so dreadful, and shivering about the black\npit-hole so. And when the black things came into the house, she was\ngoing clean out of her little mind, ever so many times almost. No use\nit was at all to tell her ever so much a-yard they was. \'I don\'t yike\nback, and I \'on\'t have back. Yite I yikes, and boo I yikes; and my dear\npapa be so very angy, when I tells him all about it.\' She went on like\nthat, and she did so cry, mother said she must change the air a bit.""\n\nAll the time he was telling me this, she watched him with her head on\none side and her lips kept ready in the most comic manner, as much as to\nsay, ""Now you tell any stories at my expense, and you may look out."" But\nWatkin was truth itself, and she nodded, and said ""Ness,"" at the end of\nhis speech.\n\n""And, if you please, sir, Mr Llewellyn, whatever is a \'belung,\' sir? All\nthe way she have been asking for \'belung, belung, belung.\' And I cannot\ntell for the life of me whatever is \'belung.\'""\n\n""Boy, never ask what is unbecoming,"" I replied, in a manner which made\nhim blush, according to my intention. For the word might be English for\nall I knew, and have something of high life in it. However, I found,\nby-and-by, that it meant what she was able to call ""Ummibella,"" when\npromoted a year in the dictionary.\n\nBut now anybody should only have seen her, who wanted a little rousing\nup. My cottage, of course, is not much to boast of, compared with\ncastles, and so on; nevertheless there is something about it pleasant\nand good, like its owner. You might see ever so many houses, and think\nthem larger, and grander, and so on, with more opportunity for sitting\ndown, and less for knocking your head perhaps; and after all you would\ncome back to mine. Not for the sake of the meat in the cupboard--because\nI seldom had any, and far inferior men had more; but because--well, it\ndoes not matter. I never could make you understand, unless you came to\nsee it.\n\nOnly I felt that I had found a wonderful creature to make me out, and\nenter almost into my own views (of which the world is not capable) every\ntime I took this child up and down the staircase. She would have jumps,\nand she made me talk in a manner that quite surprised myself; and such a\nfine feeling grew up between us, that it was a happy thing for the whole\nof us, not to have Bunny in the way just then. Mother Jones was giving\nher apple-party; as she always did when the red streaks came upon her\n""Early Margarets."" But I always think the White Juneating is a far\nsuperior apple: and I have a tree of it. My little garden is nothing\ngrand, any more than the rest of my premises, or even myself, if it\ncomes to that; still you might go for a long day\'s walk, and find very\nfew indeed to beat it, unless you were contradictory. For ten doors at\nleast, both west and east, this was admitted silently; as was proved by\ntheir sending to me for a cabbage, an artichoke, or an onion, or\nanything choice for a Sunday dinner. It may suit these very people now\nto shake their heads and to run me down, but they should not forget what\nI did for them, when it comes to pronouncing fair judgment.\n\nPoor Bardie appeared as full of bright spirit, and as brave as ever, and\nwhen she tumbled from jumping two steps, what did she do but climb back\nand jump three, which even Bunny was afraid to do. But I soon perceived\nthat this was only a sort of a flash in the pan, as it were. The happy\nchange from the gloom of Sker House, from the silent corners and\ncreaking stairs, and long-faced people keeping watch, and howling every\nnow and then--also the sight of me again (whom she looked upon as her\nchief protector), and the general air of tidiness belonging to my\ndwelling--these things called forth all at once the play and joyful\nspring of her nature. But when she began to get tired of this, and to\nlong for a little coaxing, even the stupidest gaffer could see that she\nwas not the child she had been. Her little face seemed pinched and pale,\nand prematurely grave and odd; while in the grey eyes tears shone ready\nat any echo of thought to fall. Also her forehead, broad and white,\nwhich marked her so from common children, looked as if too much of\npuzzling and of wondering had been done there. Even the gloss of her\nrich brown poll was faded, with none to care for it; while the dainty\nfeet and hands, so sensitive as to a speck of dirt, were enough to bring\nthe tears of pity into a careful mother\'s eyes.\n\n""Gardy la! \'Ook \'e see, \'hot degustin\' naily pailies! And poor Bardie\nnuffin to kean \'em with!""\n\nWhile I was setting this grief to rest (for which she kissed me\nbeautifully), many thoughts came through my mind about this little\ncreature. She and I were of one accord, upon so many important points;\nand when she differed from me, perhaps she was in the right almost:\nwhich is a thing that I never knew happen in a whole village of grown-up\npeople. And by the time I had brushed her hair and tied up the bows of\nher frock afresh, and when she began to dance again, and to play every\nkind of trick with me, I said to myself, ""I must have this child.\nWhatever may come of it, I will risk--when the price of butcher\'s-meat\ncomes down.""\n\nThis I said in real earnest; but the price of butcher\'s-meat went up,\nand I never have known it come down again.\n\nWhile I was thinking, our Bunny came in, full of apples, raw and\nroasted, and of the things the children said. But at the very first\nsight of Bardie, everything else was gone from her. All the other\nchildren were fit only to make dirt-pies of. This confirmed and held me\nsteadfast in the opinions which I had formed without any female\nassistance.\n\nIn spite of all her own concerns (of which she was full enough, goodness\nknows), Bunny came up, and pulled at her, by reason of something down\nher back, which wanted putting to rights a little--a plait, or a tuck,\nor some manner of gear; only I thought it a clever thing, and the little\none approved of it. And then, our Bunny being in her best, these\nchildren took notice of one another, to settle which of them was nearer\nto the proper style of clothes. And each admired the other for anything\nwhich she had not got herself.\n\n""Come, you baby-chits,"" said I, being pleased at their womanly ways, so\nearly; ""all of us want some food, I think. Can we eat our dresses?"" The\nchildren, of course, understood me not; nevertheless, what I said was\nsense.\n\nAnd if, to satisfy womankind--for which I have deepest regard and\nrespect--I am forced to enter into questions higher than reason of men\ncan climb--of washing, and ironing, and quilling, and gaufreing, and\nsetting up, and styles of transparent reefing, and all our other\nendeavours to fetch this child up to her station--the best thing I can\ndo will be to have mother Jones in to write it for me; if only she can\nbe forced to spell.\n\nHowever, that is beyond all hope; and even I find it hard sometimes to\nbe sure of the royal manner. Only I go by the Bible always, for every\nword that I can find; being taught (ever since I could read at all) that\nhis Majesty, James I., confirmed it.\n\nNow this is not all the thing which I wanted to put before you clearly;\nbecause I grow like a tombstone often, only fit to make you laugh, when\nI stand on my right to be serious. My great desire is to tell you what I\ndid, and how I did it, as to the managing of these children, even for a\nday or two, so as to keep them from crying, or scorching, or spoiling\ntheir clothes, or getting wet, or having too much victuals or too\nlittle. Of course I consulted that good mother Jones five or six times\nevery day; and she never was weary of giving advice, though she said\nevery time that it must be the last. And a lucky thing it was for me in\nall this responsibility to have turned enough of money, through skilful\ncatch and sale of fish, to allow of my staying at home a little, and not\nonly washing and mending of clothes, but treating the whole of the\nhousehold to the delicacies of the season. However, it is not my habit\nto think myself anything wonderful; that I leave to the rest of the\nworld: and no doubt any good and clever man might have done a great part\nof what I did. Only if anything should befall us, out of the reach of a\nsailor\'s skill and the depth of Bunny\'s experience, mother Jones\npromised to come straight in, the very moment I knocked at the wall; and\nher husband slept with such musical sound that none could be lonely in\nany house near, and so did all of her ten children who could crack a\nlollipop.\n\nUpon the whole, we passed so smoothly over the first evening, with the\ntwo children as hard at play as if they were paid fifty pounds for it,\nthat having some twenty-five shillings in hand after payment of all\ncreditors, and only ten weeks to my pension-day, with my boat unknown to\nanybody, and a very good prospect of fish running up from the Mumbles at\nthe next full moon, I set the little one on my lap, after a good bout of\nlaughing at her very queer ins and outs--for all things seem to be all\nalive with, as well as to, her.\n\n""Will you stay with me, my dear?"" I said, as bold as King George and the\nDragon; ""would you like to live with old Davy and Bunny, and have ever\nso many frocks washed, soon as ever he can buy them?"" For nothing\nsatisfied her better than to see her one gown washed. She laid her head\non one side a little, so that I felt it hot to my bosom, being excused\nof my waistcoat; and I knew that she had overworked herself.\n\n""Ness,"" she said, after thinking a bit. ""Ness, I live with \'a, old Davy,\ntill my dear mama come for me. Does \'e know, old Davy, \'hot I thinks?""\n\n""No, my pretty; I only know that you are always thinking."" And so she\nwas; no doubt of it.\n\n""I tell \'a, old Davy, \'hot I thinks. No--I can\'t tell \'a; only sompfin.\n\'Et me go for more pay with Bunny.""\n\n""No, my dear, just stop a minute. Bunny has got no breath left in her;\nshe is such a great fat Bunny. What you mean to say is, that you don\'t\nknow how papa and mama could ever think of leaving you such a long, long\ntime away.""\n\nShe shook her curly pate as if each frizzle were a puzzle; and her sweet\nwhite forehead seemed a mainsail full of memory; and then gay presence\nwas in her eyes, and all the play which I had stopped broke upon her\nmind again.\n\n""Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,"" she began, with her beautiful fingers\ncrawling, like white carnelian compasses, up the well-made buttons of my\nnew smock-guernsey; for though I had begged my hot waistcoat off, I\nnever was lax of dress in her presence as I would be in Bunny\'s--or, in\nshort, with anybody except this little lady. I myself taught her that\n""tinker, tailor,"" and had a right to have it done to me. And she\nfinished it off with such emphasis upon button No. 7, which happened to\nbe the last of them, ""gentleman, ploughboy, fief,"" looking straight into\nmy eyes, and both of us laughing at the fine idea that I could possibly\nbe called a thief! But fearing to grow perhaps foolish about her, as she\ndid these charming things to me, I carried her up to bed with Bunny, and\nsung them both away to sleep with a melancholy dirge of sea.\n\nInto whatever state of life it may please God to call me--though I fear\nthere cannot be many more at this age of writing--it always will be, as\nit always has been, my first principle and practice to do my very utmost\n(which is far less than it was, since the doctor stopped my hornpipes)\nto be pleasant and good company. And it is this leading motive which has\nkept me from describing--as I might have done, to make you tingle and be\nangry afterwards--the state of Sker House, and of Evan Thomas, and Moxy\nhis wife, and all their friends, about those five poor rabbiters. Also\nother darkish matters, such as the plight of those obstinate black men\nwhen they came ashore at last, three together, and sometimes four, as if\nthey had fought in the water. And, after all, what luck they had in\nobtaining proper obsequies, inasmuch as, by order of Crowner Bowles, a\ngreat hole in the sand was dug in a little sheltered valley, and kept\nopen till it was fairly thought that the sea must have finished with\nthem; and then, after being carefully searched for anything of value,\nthey were rolled in all together and kept down with stones, like the\nparish mangle, and covered with a handsome mound of sand. And not only\nthis, but in spite of expense and the murmuring of the vestry, a board\nwell tarred (to show their colour) was set up in the midst of it, and\ntheir number ""35"" chalked up; and so they were stopped of their mischief\nawhile, after shamefully robbing their poor importer.\n\nBut if this was conducted handsomely, how much more so were the\nfunerals of the five young white men! The sense of the neighbourhood,\nand the stir, and the presence of the Coroner (who stopped a whole week\nfor sea air and freshness, after seeing so many good things come in, and\nperceiving so many ways home that night, that he made up his mind to\nnone of them); also the feeling (which no one expressed, but all would\nhave been disappointed of) that honest black Evan, after knocking so\nmany men down in both parishes and the extra-parochial manor, was\ndesigned, by this downright blow from above, to repent and to entertain\nevery one; and most of all, the fact that five of a highly respectable\nfamily were to be buried at once, to the saving of four future funerals,\nall of which must have been fine ones,--these universal sympathies\ncompelled the house and the people therein to exert themselves to the\nuttermost.\n\nEnough that it gave satisfaction, not universal, but general; and even\nthat last is a hard thing to do in such great outbursts of sympathy.\nThough Moudlin church is more handy for Sker, and the noble Portreeve of\nKenfig stood upon his right to it, still there were stronger reasons why\nold Newton should have the preference. And Sker being outside either\nparish, Crowner Bowles, on receipt of a guinea, swore down the Portreeve\nto his very vamps. For Moxy Thomas was a Newton woman, and loved every\nscrape of a shoe there; and her uncle, the clerk, would have ended his\ndays if the fees had gone over to Kenfig. Our parson, as well, was a\nvery fine man, and a match for the whole of the service; while the\nlittle fellow at Moudlin always coughed at a word of three syllables.\n\nThere was one woman in our village who was always right. She had been\ndisappointed, three times over, in her early and middle days; and the\neffect of this on her character was so lasting and so wholesome, that\nshe never spoke without knowing something. When from this capital female\nI heard that our churchyard had won the victory, and when I foresaw the\ndemented condition of glory impending upon our village (not only from\nfive magnificent palls, each with its proper attendance of black, and\neach with fine hymns and good howling, but yet more than that from the\nhot strength of triumph achieved over vaunting Kenfig), then it came\ninto my mind to steal away with Bardie.\n\nA stern and sad sacrifice of myself, I assured myself that it was, and\nwould be; for few even of our oldest men could enjoy a funeral more than\nI did, with its sad reflections and junketings. And I might have been\nhead-man of all that day, entitled not only to drop the mould, but to\nmake the speech afterwards at the Inn.\n\nBut I abandoned all these rights, and braved once more the opinions of\nneighbours (which any man may do once too often); and when the advance\nof sound came towards us, borne upon the western wind from the end of\nNewton Wayn, slowly hanging through the air, as if the air loved death\nof man--the solemn singing of the people who must go that way\nthemselves, and told it in their melody; and when the Clevice rock rung\nsoftly with the tolling bell, as well as with the rolling dirges, we\nslipped away at the back of it--that is to say, pretty Bardie and I. For\nBunny was purer of Newton birth than to leave such a sight without\ntearing away. And desiring some little to hear all about it, I left her\nwith three very good young women, smelling strongly of southernwood, who\nwere beginning to weep already, and promised to tell me the whole of it.\n\nAs we left this dismal business, Bardie danced along beside me, like an\nostrich-feather blown at. In among the sandhills soon I got her, where\nshe could see nothing, and the thatch of rushes deadened every pulse of\nthe funeral bell. And then a strange idea took me, all things being\nstrange just now, that it might prove a rich wise thing to go for a\nquiet cruise with Bardie. In that boat, and on the waves, she might\nremember things recovered by the chance of semblance. Therefore, knowing\nthat all living creatures five miles either way of us were sure to be in\nNewton churchyard nearly all the afternoon, and then in the\npublic-houses, I scrupled not to launch my boat and go to sea with the\nlittle one. For if we steered a proper course no funeral could see us.\nAnd so I shipped her gingerly. The glory of her mind was such that\noverboard she must have jumped, except for my Sunday neck-tie with a\nhalf-hitch knot around her. And the more I rowed the more she laughed,\nand looked at the sun with her eyes screwed up, and at the water with\nall wide open. ""\'Hare is \'a going, old Davy?"" she said, slipping from\nunder my Sunday splice, and coming to me wonderfully, and laying her\ntiny hands on mine, which beat me always, as she had found out; ""is \'a\ngoing to my dear papa, and mama, and ickle bother?""\n\n""No, my pretty, you must wait for them to come. We are going to catch\nsome fish, and salt them, that they may keep with a very fine smell,\ntill your dear papa brings your mama and all the family with him; and\nthen what a supper we will have!""\n\n""\'Ill \'a,"" she said; ""and poor Bardie too?""\n\nBut the distance of the supper-time was a very sad disappointment to\nher, and her bright eyes filled with haze. And then she said ""Ness"" very\nquietly, because she was growing to understand that she could not have\nher own way now. I lay on my oars and watched her carefully, while she\nwas shaking her head and wondering, with her little white shoulders\nabove the thwart, and her innocent and intelligent eyes full of the\nspreading sky and sea. It was not often one had the chance, through the\never-flitting change, to learn the calm and true expression of that poor\nyoung creature\'s face. Even now I could not tell, except that her\nplayful eyes were lonely, and her tender lips were trembling, and a\nheartful of simple love could find no outlet, and lost itself. These\nlittle things, when thinking thus, or having thought flow through them,\nnever ought to be disturbed, because their brains are tender. The\nunknown stream will soon run out, and then they are fit again for play,\nwhich is the proper work of man. We open the world, and we close the\nworld, with nothing more than this; and while our manhood is too grand\n(for a score and a half of years, perhaps), to take things but in\nearnest, the justice of our birth is on us,--we are fortune\'s plaything.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nPUBLIC APPROBATION.\n\n\nIf that child had no luck herself (except, of course, in meeting me), at\nany rate she never failed to bring me wondrous fortune. The air was\nsmooth, and sweet, and soft, the sky had not a wrinkle, and the fickle\nsea was smiling, proud of pleasant manners. Directly I began to fish at\nthe western tail of the Tuskar, scarcely a fish forebore me.\nWhiting-pollacks run in shoals, and a shoal I had of them; and the way I\nsplit and dried them made us long for breakfast-time. And Bardie did\nenjoy them so.\n\nThe more I dwelled with that little child, the more I grew wrapped up in\nher. Her nature was so odd and loving, and her ways so pretty. Many men\nforego their goodness, so that they forget the nature of a little\ndarling child. Otherwise, perhaps, we might not, if we kept our hearts\naright, so despise the days of loving, and the time of holiness. Now\nthis baby almost shamed me, and I might say Bunny too, when, having\nundressed her, and put the coarse rough night-gown on her, which came\nfrom Sker with the funerals, my grandchild called me from up-stairs, to\nmeet some great emergency.\n\n""Granny, come up with the stick dreckly moment, granny dear! Missy \'ont\ngo into bed. Such a bad wicked child she is.""\n\nI ran up-stairs, and there was Bunny all on fire with noble wrath, and\nthere stood Bardie sadly scraping the worm-eaten floor with her small\nwhite toes.\n\n""I\'se not a yicked shild,"" she said, ""I\'se a yae good gal, I is; I \'ont\ngo to bed till I say my payers to \'Mighty God, as my dear mama make me.\nShe be very angy with \'a, Bunny, \'hen she knows it.""\n\nHereupon I gave Bunny a nice little smack, and had a great mind to let\nher taste the stick which she had invoked so eagerly. However, she\nroared enough without it, because her feelings were deeply hurt. Bardie\nalso cried for company, or, perhaps, at my serious aspect, until I put\nher down on her knees and bade her say her prayers, and have done with\nit. At the same time it struck me how stupid I was not to have asked\nabout this before, inasmuch as even a child\'s religion may reveal some\nof its history.\n\nShe knelt as prettily as could be, with her head thrown back, and her\ntiny palms laid together upon her breast, and thus she said her simple\nprayer.\n\n""Pay God bless dear papa, and mama, and ickle bother. Gentle Jesus, meek\nand mild, \'ook upon a ickle shild, and make me a good gal. Amen.""\n\nThen she got up and kissed poor Bunny, and was put into bed as good as\ngold, and slept like a little dormouse till morning.\n\nTake it altogether now, we had a happy time of it. Every woman in Newton\npraised me for my kindness to the child; and even the men who had too\nmany could not stand against Bardie\'s smile. They made up, indeed, some\nscandalous story, as might have been expected, about my relationship to\nthe baby, and her sudden appearance so shortly after my poor wife\'s\ndeath. However, by knocking three men down, I produced a more active\ngrowth of charity in our neighbourhood.\n\nAnd very soon a thing came to pass, such as I never could have\nexpected, and of a nature to lift me (even more than the free use of my\npole) for a period of at least six months, above the reach of libel,\nfrom any one below the rank of a justice of the peace. This happened\njust as follows:--One night the children were snug in bed, and finding\nthe evenings long, because the days were shortening in so fast--which\nseemed to astonish everybody--it came into my head to go no more than\noutside my own door, and into the ""Jolly Sailors."" For the autumn seemed\nto be coming on, and I like to express my opinions upon that point in\nsociety; never being sure where I may be before ever another autumn.\nMoreover, the landlord was not a man to be neglected with impunity. He\nnever liked his customers to stay too long away from him, any more than\nour parson did; and pleasant as he was when pleased, and generous in the\nway of credit to people with any furniture, nothing was more sure to vex\nhim, than for a man without excuse, to pretend to get on without him.\n\nNow when I came into the room, where our little sober proceedings are--a\nnarrow room, and dark enough, yet full of much good feeling, also with\nhard wooden chairs worn soft by generations of sitting--a sudden stir\narose among the excellent people present. They turned and looked at me,\nas if they had never enjoyed that privilege, or, at any rate, had failed\nto make proper use of it before. And ere my modesty was certain whether\nthis were for good or harm, they raised such a clapping with hands and\nfeet, and a clinking of glasses in a line with it, that I felt myself\nworthy of some great renown. I stood there and bowed, and made my best\nleg, and took off my hat in acknowledgment. Observing this, they were\nall delighted, as if I had done them a real honour; and up they arose\nwith one accord, and gave me three cheers, with an Englishman setting\nthe proper tune for it.\n\nI found myself so overcome all at once with my own fame and celebrity,\nthat I called for a glass of hot rum-and-water, with the nipple of a\nlemon in it, and sugar the size of a nutmeg. My order was taken with a\nspeed and deference hitherto quite unknown to me; and better than that,\nseven men opened purses, and challenged the right to pay for it.\nEntering into so rare a chance of getting on quite gratis, and knowing\nthat such views are quick to depart, I called for six oz. of tobacco,\nwith the Bristol stamp (a red crown) upon it. Scarce had I tested the\ndraught of a pipe--which I had to do sometimes for half an hour, with\nall to blow out, and no drawing in--when the tobacco was at my elbow,\nserved with a saucer, and a curtsey. ""Well,"" thought I, ""this is real\nglory."" And I longed to know how I had earned it.\n\nIt was not likely, with all those people gazing so respectfully, that I\nwould deign to ask them coarsely, what the deuce could have made them do\nit. I had always felt myself unworthy of obscure position, and had\ndreamed, for many years, of having my merits perceived at last. And to\nask the reason would have been indeed a degradation, although there was\nnot a fibre of me but quivered to know all about it. Herein, however, I\novershot the mark, as I found out afterwards; for my careless manner\nmade people say that I must have written the whole myself--a thing so\nvery far below me, that I scorn to answer it. But here it is; and then\nyou can judge from the coarse style, and the three-decked words, whether\nit be work of mine.\n\nFelix Farley\'s Bristol Journal, Saturday, July 24, 1782.--""_Shipwreck\nand loss of all hands_--_Heroism of a British tar_.--We hear of a sad\ncatastrophe from the coast of Glamorganshire. The season of great heat\nand drought, from which our readers must have suffered, broke up, as\nthey may kindly remember, with an almost unprecedented gale of wind and\nthunder, on Sunday, the 11th day of this month. In the height of the\ntempest a large ship was descried, cast by the fury of the elements upon\na notorious reef of rocks, at a little place called Sker, about twenty\nmiles to the east of Swansea. Serious apprehensions were entertained by\nthe spectators for the safety of the crew, which appeared to consist of\nblack men. Their fears were too truly verified, for in less than an hour\nthe ill-fated bark succumbed to her cruel adversaries. No adult male of\neither colour appears to have reached the shore alive, although a\ncelebrated fisherman, and heroic pensioner of our royal navy, whose name\nis David Llewellyn, and who traces his lineage from the royal bard of\nthat patronymic, performed prodigies of valour, and proved himself\nutterly regardless of his own respectable and blameless life, by\nplunging repeatedly into the boiling surges, and battling with the\nraging elements, in the vain hope of extricating the sufferers from a\nwatery grave. With the modesty which appears to be, under some\ninscrutable law of nature, inseparable from courage of the highest\norder, this heroic tar desires to remain in obscurity. This we could not\nreconcile with our sense of duty; and if any lover of our black brethren\nfinds himself moved by this narration, we shall be happy to take charge\nof any remittance marked \'D. L.\' It grieves us to add that none escaped\nexcept an intelligent young female, who clung to the neck of Llewellyn.\nShe states that the ship was the Andalusia, and had sailed from\nAppledore, which is, we believe, in Devonshire. The respected Coroner\nBowles held an inquest, which afforded universal satisfaction.""\n\nDeeply surprised as I was to find how accurately, upon the whole, this\npaper had got the story of it--for not much less than half was true--it\nwas at first a puzzle to me how they could have learned so much about\nmyself, and the valiant manner in which I intended to behave, but found\nno opportunity. Until I remembered that a man, possessing a very bad\nhat, had requested the honour of introducing himself to me, in my own\nhouse, and had begged me by all means to consider myself at home, and to\nallow him to send for refreshment, which I would not hear of twice, but\ngave him what I thought up to his mark, according to manners and\nappearance. And very likely he made a mistake between my description of\nwhat I was ready, as well as desirous, to carry out, and what I bodily\ndid go through, ay, and more, to the back of it. However, I liked this\naccount very much, and resolved to encourage yet more warmly the next\nman who came to me with a bad hat. What, then, was my disgust at\nperceiving, at the very foot of that fine description, a tissue of stuff\nlike the following!\n\n""_Another account_ [from a highly-esteemed correspondent].--The great\ninvasion of sand, which has for so many generations spread such wide\ndevastation, and occasioned such grievous loss to landowners on the\nwestern coast of Glamorganshire, made another great stride in the storm\nof Sabbath-day, July 11. A vessel of considerable burthen, named the\nAndalusia, and laden with negroes, most carefully shipped for conversion\namong the good merchants of Bristol, appears to have been swallowed up\nby the sand; and our black fellow-creatures disappeared. It is to be\nfeared, from this visitation of an ever-benign Providence, that few of\nthem had been converted, and that the burden of their sins disabled them\nfrom swimming. If one had been snatched as a brand from the burning,\ngladly would we have recorded it, and sent him forward prayerfully for\nsustenance on his way to the Lord. But the only eyewitness (whose word\nmust never be relied upon when mammon enters into the conflict), a\nworn-out but well-meaning sailor, who fattens upon the revenue of an\noverburdened country--this man ran away so fast that he saw hardly\nanything. The Lord, however, knoweth His own in the days of visitation.\nA little child came ashore alive, and a dead child bearing a coronet.\nMany people have supposed that the pusillanimous sailor aforesaid knows\nmuch more than he will tell. It is not for us to enter into that part of\nthe question. Duty, however, compels us to say, that any one desiring to\nhave a proper comprehension of this heavy but righteous judgment--for He\ndoeth all things well--cannot do better than apply to the well-known\nhorologist of Bridgend, Hezekiah Perkins, also to the royal family.""\n\nThe above yarn may simply be described as a gallow\'s-rope spun by Jack\nKetch himself from all the lies of all the scoundrels he has ever\nhanged, added to all that his own vile heart can invent, with the devil\nto help him. The cold-blooded, creeping, and crawling manner in which I\nmyself was alluded to--although without the manliness even to set my\nname down--as well as the low hypocrisy of the loathsome white-livered\nsyntax of it, made me,--well, I will say no more--the filthiness reeks\nwithout my stirring, and, indeed, no honest man should touch it; only,\nif Hezekiah Perkins had chanced to sneak into the room just then, his\nwife might have prophesied shrouds and weeds.\n\nFor who else was capable of such lies, slimed with so much sanctimony,\nlike cellar slugs, or bilge-hole rats, rolling in Angelica, while all\ntheir entrails are of brimstone, such as Satan would scorn to vomit? A\nbitter pain went up my right arm, for the weakness of my heart, when\nthat miscreant gave me insult, and I never knocked him down the well.\nAnd over and over again I have found it a thorough mistake to be always\nforgiving. However, to have done with reflections which must suggest\nthemselves to any one situated like me--if, indeed, any one ever\nwas--after containing myself, on account of the people who surrounded\nme, better than could have been hoped for, I spoke, because they\nexpected it.\n\n""Truly, my dear friends, I am thankful for your goodwill towards me.\nAlso to the unknown writer, who has certainly made too much of my poor\nunaided efforts. I did my best; it was but little: and who dreams of\nbeing praised for it? Again, I am thankful to this other writer, who has\noverlooked me altogether. For the sake of poor Sandy Macraw, we must\nthank him that he kindly forbore to make public the name.""\n\nYou should have seen the faces of all the folk around the table when I\ngave them this surprise.\n\n""Why,"" said one, ""we thought for sure that it was you he was meaning,\nDyo dear. And in our hearts we were angry to him, for such falsehoods\nlarge and black. Indeed and indeed, true enough it may be of a man\noutlandish such as Sandy Macraw is.""\n\n""Let us not hasten to judge,"" I replied; ""Sandy is brave enough, I\ndaresay, and he can take his own part well. I will not believe that he\nran away; very likely he never was there at all. If he was, he deserves\nhigh praise for taking some little care of himself. I should not have\nbeen so stiff this night, if I had only had the common-sense to follow\nhis example.""\n\nAll our people began to rejoice; and yet they required, as all of us do,\nsomething more than strongest proof.\n\n""What reason is to show then, Dyo, that this man of letters meant not\nyou, but Sandy Macraw, to run away so?""\n\n""Hopkin, read it aloud,"" I said; ""neither do I know, nor care, what the\nwriter\'s meaning was. Only I thought there was something spoken about\nhis Majesty\'s revenue. Is it I, or is it Sandy, that belongs to the\nrevenue?""\n\nThis entirely settled it. All our people took it up, and neglected not\nto tell one another. So that in less than three days\' time, my name was\nspread far and wide for the praise, and the Scotchman\'s for the\ncondemnation. I desired it not, as my friends well knew; but what use to\nbeat to windward, against the breath of the whole of the world?\nTherefore I was not so obstinate as to set my opinion against the rest;\nbut left it to Mr Macraw to rebut, if he could, his pusillanimity.\n\nAs for Hezekiah Perkins, all his low creations fell upon the head from\nwhich they sprang. I spoke to our rector about his endeavour to harm a\nrespectable Newton man--for you might call Macraw that by comparison,\nthough he lived at Porthcawl, and was not respectable--and everybody was\nstruck with my kindness in using such handsome terms of a rival. The\nresult was that Perkins lost our church-clock, which paid him as well as\na many two others, having been presented to the parish, and therefore\nnot likely to go without pushing. For our rector was a peppery man,\nexcept when in the pulpit, and what he said to Hezekiah was exactly\nthis.\n\n""What, Perkins! another great bill again! \'To repair of church-clock,\nseven-and-sixpence; to ten miles\' travelling, at threepence per\nmile,\'--and so on, and so on! Why, you never came further than my\nbrother the Colonel\'s, the last three times you have charged for. Allow\nme to ask you a little question: to whom did you go for the keys of the\nchurch?""\n\n""As if I should want any keys of the church! There is no church-lock in\nthe county that I cannot open, as soon as whistle.""\n\n""Indeed! So you pick our lock. Do you ever open a church-door honestly,\nfor the purpose of worshipping the Lord? I have kept my eye upon you,\nsir, because I hear that you have been reviling my parishioners. And I\nhappen to know that you never either opened the lock of our church or\npicked it, for the last three times you have charged for. But one thing\nyou have picked for many years, and that is the pocket of my ratepayers.\nBe off, sir--be off with your trumpery bill! We will have a good\nchurchman to do our clock--a thoroughly honest seaman, and a regular\nchurch-goer.""\n\n""Do you mean that big thief, Davy Llewellyn? Well, well, do as you\nplease. But I will thank you to pay my bill first.""\n\n""Thank me when you get it, sir. You may fall down on your canting knees,\nand thank the Lord for one thing.""\n\n""What am I to thank the Lord for? For allowing you to cheat me thus?""\n\n""For giving me self-command enough not to knock you down, sir."" With\nthat the rector came so nigh him, that brother Perkins withdrew in\nhaste; for the parson had done that sort of thing to people who ill-used\nhim; and the sense of the parish was always with him. Hence the\nmanagement of the church-clock passed entirely into my hands, and I kept\nit almost always going, at less than half Hezekiah\'s price; and this\nreunited me to the Church (from which my poor wife perhaps had led me\nastray some little), by a monthly arrangement which reflected equal\ncredit on either party.\n\nAnd even this was not the whole of the blessings that now rolled down\nupon me, for the sake, no doubt, of little Bardie, as with the ark in\nthe Bible. For this fine Felix Farley was the only great author of news\nat that time prevalent among us. It is true that there was another\njournal nearer to us, at Hereford, and a highly good one, but for a very\nclear reason it failed to have command of the public-houses. For the\ncustomers liked both their pipes and their papers to be of the same\norigin, and go together kindly. And Hereford sent out no tobacco; while\nBristol was more famous for the best Virginian birdseye, than even for\nrum, or intelligence.\n\nTherefore, as everybody gifted with the gift of reading came to the\npublic-houses gradually, and to compare interpretation over those two\nnarratives, both of which stirred our county up, my humble name was in\ntheir mouths as freely and approvingly as the sealing-wax end of their\npipe stems. Unanimous consent accrued (when all had said the same thing\nover, fifty times in different manners, and with fine-drawn argument)\nthat after all, and upon the whole, David Llewellyn was an honour to\ncounty and to country.\n\nAfter that, for at least a fortnight, no more dogs were set at me. When\nI showed myself over a gentleman\'s gate, in the hope of selling fish to\nhim, it used to be always, ""At him, Pincher!"" ""Into his legs, Growler,\nboy!"" so that I was compelled to carry my conger-rod to save me. Now,\nhowever, and for a season till my fame grew stale, I never lifted the\nlatch of a gate without hearing grateful utterance, ""Towser, down, you\nson of a gun! Yelp and Vick, hold your stupid tongues, will you?"" The\nvalue of my legs was largely understood by gentlemen. As for the ladies\nand the housemaids, if conceit were in my nature, what a run it would\nhave had! Always and always the same am I, and above even women\'s\nopinions. But I know no other man whose head would not have been turned\nwith a day of it. For my rap at the door was scarcely given (louder,\nperhaps, than it used to be) before every maid in the house was out, and\nthe lady looking through the blinds. I used to dance on the step, and\nbeat my arms on my breast, with my basket down between my legs, and\ntremble almost for a second rap; and then it was, ""Like your imperence!""\n""None of your stinking stuff!"" and so on. But now they ran down\nbeautifully, and looked up under their eyelids at me, and left me to\nshow them what I liked, and never beat down a halfpenny, and even\naccepted my own weight. Such is the grand effect of glory; and I might\nhave kissed every one of them, and many even of the good plain cooks, if\nI could have reconciled it with my sense of greatness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA CRAFT BEYOND THE LAW.\n\n\nColonel Lougher, of Candleston Court, was one of the finest and noblest\nmen it was ever my luck to come across. He never would hear a word\nagainst me, any more than I would against him; and no sooner did I see\nhim upon the Bench than I ceased to care what the evidence was. If they\nfailed to prove their falsehoods (as nearly always came to pass), he\ndismissed them with a stern reprimand for taking away my character; and\nif they seemed to establish anything by low devices against me, what did\nhe say? Why, no more than this: ""David, if what they say be true, you\nappear to have forgotten yourself in a very unusual manner. You have\npromised me always to improve; and I thought that you were doing it.\nThis seems to be a trifling charge--however, I must convict you. The\npenalty is one shilling, and the costs fifteen.""\n\n""May it please your worship,"" I always used to answer, ""is an honest man\nto lose his good name, and pay those who have none for stealing it?""\n\nHaving seen a good deal of the world, he always felt the force of this,\nbut found it difficult to say so with prejudiced men observing him. Only\nI knew that my fine and costs would be slipped into my hand by-and-by,\nwith a glimpse of the Candleston livery.\n\nThis was no more than fair between us; for not more than seven\ngenerations had passed since Griffith Llewellyn, of my true stock, had\nbeen the proper and only bard to the great Lord Lougher of Coity, whence\ndescended our good Colonel. There had been some little mistake about the\ndeparture of the title, no doubt through extremes of honesty, but no\nlord in the county came of better blood than Colonel Lougher. To such a\nman it was a hopeless thing for the bitterest enemy--if he had one--to\nimpute one white hair\'s breadth of departure from the truth. A\nthoroughly noble man to look at, and a noble man to hearken to, because\nhe knew not his own kindness, but was kind to every one. Now this good\nman had no child at all, as generally happens to very good men, for fear\nof mankind improving much. And the great king of Israel, David, from\nwhom our family has a tradition--yet without any Jewish blood in us--he\nsays (if I am not mistaken) that it is a sure mark of the ungodly to\nhave children at their desire, and to leave the rest of their substance\nto ungodly infants.\n\nNot to be all alone, the Colonel, after the death of his excellent wife,\npersuaded his only sister, the Lady Bluett, widow of Lord Bluett, to set\nup with him at Candleston. And this she was not very loath to do,\nbecause her eldest son, the present Lord Bluett, was of a wild and\nsporting turn, and no sooner became of age but that he wanted no mother\nover him. Therefore she left him for a while to his own devices, hoping\nevery month to hear of his suddenly repenting.\n\nNow this was a lady fit to look at. You might travel all day among\npeople that kept drawing-rooms, and greenhouses, and the new safe of\nmusic, well named from its colour ""grand paeony,"" and you might go up and\ndown Bridgend, even on a fair-day, yet nobody would you set eyes on fit\nto be looked at as a lady on the day that you saw Lady Bluett.\n\nIt was not that she pretended anything; that made all the difference.\nOnly she felt such a thorough knowledge that she was no more than we\nmight have been, except for a width of accidents. And nothing ever\nparted her from any one with good in him. For instance, the first time\nshe saw me again (after thirty years, perhaps, from the season of her\nbeauty-charm, when I had chanced to win all the prizes in the sports\ngiven at Candleston Court, for the manhood of now Colonel Lougher), not\nonly did she at once recognise me, in spite of all my battering, but she\nheld out her beautiful hand, and said, ""How are you, Mr Llewellyn?""\nNobody had ever called me ""Mr Llewellyn"" much till then; but, by good\nluck, a washerwoman heard it and repeated it; and since that day there\nare not many people (leaving out clods and low enemies) with the face to\naccost me otherwise.\n\nHowever, this is not to the purpose, any more than it is worthy of me.\nHow can it matter what people call me when I am clear of my fish-basket?\nas, indeed, I always feel at the moment of unstrapping. No longer any\nreputation to require my fist ready. I have done my utmost, and I have\nreceived the money.\n\nThese are the fine perceptions which preserve a man of my position from\nthe effects of calumny. And, next to myself, the principal guardian of\nmy honour was this noble Colonel Lougher. Moreover, a fine little chap\nthere was, Lady Bluett\'s younger son, Honourable Rodney Bluett by name;\nfor his father had served under Admiral Rodney, and been very friendly\nwith him, and brought him to church as a godfather. This young Rodney\nBluett was about ten years old at that time, and the main delight of his\nlife was this, to come fishing with old Davy. The wondrous yarns I used\nto spin had such an effect on his little brain, that his prospects on\ndry land, and love of his mother, and certain inheritance from the\nColonel, were helpless to keep him from longing always to see the things\nwhich I had seen. With his large blue eyes upon me, and his flaxen hair\ntied back, and his sleeves tucked up for paddling, hour by hour he would\nlisten, when the weather was too rough to do much more than look at it.\nOr if we went out in a boat (as we did when he could pay for hiring, and\nwhen his mother was out of the way), many and many a time I found him,\nwhen he should have been quick with the bait, dwelling upon the fine\nideas which my tales had bred in him. I took no trouble in telling them,\nneither did I spare the truth when it would come in clumsily (like a\nlubber who cannot touch his hat), but they all smelled good and true,\nbecause they had that character.\n\nHowever, he must bide his time, as every one of us has to do, before I\nmake too much of him. And just at the period now in hand he was down in\nmy black books for never coming near me. It may have been that he had\norders not to be so much with me, and very likely that was wise; for\nneither his mother nor his uncle could bear the idea of his going to\nsea, but meant to make a red herring of him, as we call those poor\nland-soldiers. Being so used to his pretty company, and his admiration,\nalso helping him as I did to spend his pocket-money, I missed him more\nthan I could have believed; neither could I help sorrowing at this great\nloss of opportunity; for many an honest shilling might have been turned\nere winter by the hire of my boat to him when he came out with me\nfishing. I had prepared a scale of charges, very little over Captain\nBob\'s, to whom he used to pay 4d. an hour, when I let him come after the\nwhiting with me. And now, for no more than 6d. an hour, he should have\nmy very superior boat, and keep her head by my directions, for he\nunderstood a rudder, and bait my hooks, and stow my fish, and enjoy (as\nall boys should) the idea of being useful.\n\nFor, as concerns that little barkie, I had by this time secured myself\nfrom any further uneasiness, or troublesome need of concealment, by a\nbold and spirited facing of facts, which deserve the congratulation of\nall honest fishermen. The boat, like her little captain, was at first\nall white--as I may have said--but now, before her appearance in public,\nI painted her gunwale and strakes bright blue, even down to her\nwater-mark; and then, without meddling with her name, or rather that of\nthe ship she belonged to, I retraced very lightly, but so that any one\ncould read it, the name of the port from which she hailed, and which (as\nI felt certain now, from what I had seen on the poor wrecked ship) must\nhave been San Salvador; and the three last letters were so plain, that I\nscarcely had to touch them.\n\nNow this being done, and an old worn painter shipped instead of the new\none, which seemed to have been chopped off with an axe, I borrowed a\nboat and stood off to sea from Porthcawl Point, where they beach them,\nhaving my tackle and bait on board, as if for an evening off the Tuskar,\nwhere turbot and whiting-pollack are. Here I fished until dusk of the\nnight, and as long as the people ashore could see me; but as soon as all\nwas dark and quiet, I just pulled into Newton Bay, and landed opposite\nthe old ""Red house,"" where my new boat lay in ordinary, snug as could\nbe, and all out of sight. For the ruins of this old ""Red house"" had such\na repute for being haunted, ever since a dreadful murder cast a ban\naround it, that even I never wished to stop longer than need be there at\nnight; and once or twice I heard a noise that went to the marrow of my\nback; of which, however, I will say no more, until it comes to the\nproper place. Enough that no man, woman, or child, for twenty miles\nround, except myself, had a conscience clear enough to go in there after\ndark, and scarcely even by daylight. My little craft was so light and\nhandy, that, with the aid of the rollers ready, I led her down over the\nbeach myself, and presently towed her out to sea, with the water as\nsmooth as a duck-pond, and the tide of the neap very silent. The weather\nwas such as I could not doubt, being now so full of experience.\nTherefore, I had no fear to lie in a very dangerous berth indeed, when\nany cockle of a sea gets up, or even strong tides are running. This was\nthe west-end fork of the Tuskar, making what we call ""callipers;"" for\nthe back of the Tuskar dries at half-ebb, and a wonderful ridge stops\nthe run of the tide, not only for weeds but for fish as well. Here with\nmy anchor down, I slept, as only a virtuous man can sleep.\n\nIn the grey of the morning, I was up, ere the waning moon was done with,\nand found the very thing to suit me going on delightfully. The heavy dew\nof autumn, rising from the land by perspiration, spread a cloud along\nthe shore. A little mist was also crawling on the water here and there;\nand having slept with a watch-coat and tarpaulin over me, I shook myself\nup, without an ache, and like a good bee at the gate of the hive, was\nbrisk for making honey.\n\nHence I pulled away from land, with the heavy boat towing the light one,\nand even Sandy Macraw unable to lay his gimlet eye on me. And thus I\nrowed, until quite certain of being over three miles from land. Then\nwith the broad sun rising nobly, and for a moment bowing, till the white\nfog opened avenues, I spread upon my pole a shirt which mother Jones had\nwashed for me. It was the time when Sandy Macraw was bound to be up to\nhis business; and I had always made a point of seeing that he did it. To\nhave a low fellow of itchy character, and no royal breed about him,\nthrust by a feeble and reckless government into the berth that by nature\nwas mine, and to find him not content with this, but even in his hours\nof duty poaching, both day and night, after my fish; and when I desired\nto argue with him, holding his tongue to irritate me,--satisfaction\nthere could be none for it; the only alleviation left me was to rout up\nthis man right early, and allow him no chance of napping.\n\nTherefore, I challenged him with my shirt, thus early in the morning,\nbecause he was bound to be watching the world, if he acted up to his\nnasty business, such as no seaman would deign to; and after a quarter of\nan hour perhaps, very likely it was his wife that answered. At any rate\nthere was a signal up, and through my spy-glass I saw that people wanted\nto launch a boat, but failed. Therefore I made a great waving of shirt,\nas much as to say, ""extreme emergency; have the courage to try again.""\nExpecting something good from this, they laid their shoulders, and\nworked their legs, and presently the boat was bowing on the\ngently-fluted sea.\n\nNow it was not that I wanted help, for I could have managed it all well\nenough; but I wanted witnesses. For never can I bear to seem to set at\nnought legality. And these men were sure, upon half-a-crown, to place\nthe facts before the public in an honest manner. So I let them row away\nfor the very lives of them, as if the salvage of the nation hung upon\ntheir thumbs and elbows; only I dowsed my shirt as soon as I found them\ngetting eager. And I thought that they might as well hail me first, and\nslope off disappointment.\n\n""Hoy there! Boat ahoy! What, old Davy Llewellyn!""\n\nWhat man had a right to call me ""old""? There I was as fresh as ever. And\nI felt it the more that the man who did it was grey on the cheeks with a\nvery large family, and himself that vile old Sandy! Nevertheless I\npreserved good manners.\n\n""Ship your starboard oars, you lubbers. Do you want to run me down? What\nthe devil brings you here, at this time of the morning?"" Hereupon these\nworthy fellows dropped their oars, from wonder; until I showed them\ntheir mistake, and begged them to sheer off a little. For if I had\naccepted rope, such as they wished to throw me, they might have put in\nadverse claims, and made me pay for my own boat!\n\n""When a poor man has been at work all night,"" said I, to break off their\nofficiousness; ""while all you lazy galley-rakers were abed and snoring,\ncan\'t he put his shirt to dry, without you wanting to plunder him?""\n\nTo temper off what might appear a little rude, though wholesome, I now\npermitted them to see a stoneware gallon full of beer, or at least I had\nonly had two pints out. Finding this to be the case, and being hot with\nrowing so rapidly to my rescue, they were well content to have some\nbeer, and drop all further claims. And as I never can bear to be mean, I\ngave them the two and sixpence also.\n\nSandy Macraw took all this money; and I only hope that he shared it\nduly; and then, as he never seemed at all to understand my contempt of\nhim, he spoke in that dry drawl of his, which he always droned to drive\nme into very dreadful words, and then to keep his distance.\n\n""I am heartily glad, ma mon, to see the loock ye have encoontered. Never\nshall ye say agin that I have the advantage of ye. The boit stud me in\nmickle siller; but ye have grappit a boit for nort.""\n\nI cannot write down his outlandish manner of pronouncing English; nor\nwill I say much more about it; because he concealed his jealousy so,\nthat I had no enjoyment of it, except when I reasoned with myself. And I\nneed have expected nothing better from such a self-controlling rogue.\nBut when we came to Porthcawl Point--where some shelter is from wind,\nand two public-houses, and one private--the whole affair was so\nstraightforward, and the distance of my boat from shore, at time of\ncapture, so established and so witnessed, that no steward of any manor\ndurst even cast sheep\'s-eyes at her. A paper was drawn up and signed;\nand the two public-houses, at my expense, christened her ""Old Davy.""\nAnd indeed, for a little spell, I had enough to do with people, who came\nat all hours of the day, to drink the health of my boat and me; many of\nwhom seemed to fail to remember really who was the one to pay. And being\nstill in cash a little, and so generous always, I found a whole basket\nof whiting, and three large congers, and a lobster, disappear against\nchalk-marks, whereof I had no warning, and far worse, no flavour. But\nwhat I used to laugh at was, that when we explained to one another how\nthe law lay on this question, and how the craft became legally mine, as\na derelict from the Andalusia, drifting at more than a league from\nland,--all our folk being short and shallow in the English language,\ntook up the word, and called my boat, all over the parish, my ""RELICT;""\nas if, in spite of the Creator\'s wisdom, I were dead and my wife alive!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL INTERCOURSE.\n\n\nBut everybody must be tired of all this trouble about that boat. It\nshows what a state of things we live in, and what a meddlesome lot we\nare, that a good man cannot receive a gift straight into his hands from\nProvidence, which never before rewarded him, though he said his prayers\nevery night almost, and did his very best to cheat nobody; it proves, at\nleast to my mind, something very rotten somewhere, when a man of\nblameless character must prove his right to what he finds. However, I\nhad proved my right, and cut in Colonel Lougher\'s woods a larger pole\nthan usual, because the law would guarantee me, if at all assaulted.\n\nAnd truly, after all my care to be on the right side of it, such a vile\nattack of law was now impending on me, that with all my study of it, and\nperpetual attempts to jam its helm up almost into the very eye of\nreason, my sails very nearly failed to draw, and left me shivering in\nthe wind. But first for what comes foremost.\n\nAt that particular moment all things seemed to be most satisfactory.\nHere was my property duly secured and most useful to me, here was a run\nof fish up from the Mumbles of a very superior character, here was my\nown reputation spread by the vigilance of the public press, so that I\ncharged three farthings a-pound more than Sandy Mac did, and here was my\ncottage once more all alive with the mirth of our Bunny and Bardie. To\nsee them playing at hide-and-seek with two chairs and a table; or\n""French and English,"" which I taught them; or ""come and visit my\ngrandmother;"" or making a cat of the kettle-holder, with a pair of ears\nand a tail to it; or giving a noble dinner-party with cockles and\noyster-shells, and buttons, and apple-peel chopped finely; or, what was\neven a grander thing, eating their own dinners prettily, with their\ndolls beside them,--scarcely any one would have believed that these\nlittle ones had no mothers.\n\nAnd yet they did not altogether seem to be forgetful, or to view the\nworld as if there were no serious side to it. Very grave discourse was\nsometimes held between their bouts of play, and subjects of great depth\nand wonder introduced by doll\'s clothes. For instance:--\n\n""Hasn\'t \'a got no mama, poor Bunny, to thread \'e needle?""\n\n""No, my dear,"" I answered, for my grandchild looked stupid about it;\n""poor Bunny\'s mother is gone to heaven.""\n\n""My mama not gone to heaven. My mama come demorrow-day. I\'se almost\ntired of yaiting, old Davy, but she sure to come demorrow-day.""\n\nBut as the brave little creature spoke, I saw that ""the dust was in her\neyes."" This was her own expression always, to escape the reproach of\ncrying, when her lonely heart was working with its misty troubles, and\nsent the tears into her eyes, before the tongue could tell of them.\n""Demorrow-day, demorrow-day,"" all her loss was to be recovered always on\n""demorrow-day.""\n\nNot even so much as a doll had been saved from the total wreck of her\nfortunes; and when I beheld her wistful eyes set one day upon Bunny\'s\ndoll--although only fit for hospital, having one arm and one leg and no\nnose, besides her neck being broken--I set to at once and sharpened my\nknife upon a piece of sandstone. Then I sought out a piece of abele,\nlaid by from the figure-head of a wrecked Dutchman, and in earnest I\nfell to, and shaped such a carving of a doll as never was seen before or\nsince. Of course the little pet came, and stood, and watched every chip\nas I sliced it along, with sighs of deep expectancy, and a laugh when I\ngot to the tail of it; and of course she picked up every one, not only\nas neatest of the neat, but also accounting them sacred offsets of the\nmysterious doll unborn. I could not get her to go to bed; and it was as\ngood as a guinea to me to see the dancing in her eyes, and the spring of\nher body returning.\n\n""\'E can make a boofely doll, old Davy; but \'e doesn\'t know the yay to\ndess a doll.""\n\n""You are quite wrong there,"" said I, perceiving that I should go up, or\ndown, according to my assertion; and it made her open her eyes to see me\ncut out, with about five snips, a pair of drawers quite good enough for\nany decent woman. And she went to bed hugging the doll in that state,\nand praying to have her improved to-morrow.\n\nAt breakfast-time mother Jones dropped in, for she loved a good\nsalt-herring, and to lay down the law for the day almost; as if I knew\nscarce anything. And I always let her have her talk, and listened to it\ngravely; and clever women, as a rule, should not be denied of this\nattention; for if they are, it sours them. While she was sucking the\nlast of the tail, and telling me excellent scandal, my little lady\nmarched in straight, having finished her breakfast long ago, and bearing\nher new doll pompously. The fly-away colour in her cheeks, which always\nmade her beautiful, and the sparkle of her gleeful eyes, were come again\nwith pleasure, and so was the lovely pink of her lips, and the proper\naspect of her nose. Also she walked with such motherly rank, throwing\nher legs with a female jerk--it is enough for me to say that any\nnewly-married woman would have kissed her all round the room.\n\nNow, mother Jones, having ten fine children (five male and five female)\ngoing about with clothes up to their forks, need not have done what she\ndid, I think, and made me so bashful in my own house. For no sooner did\nshe see this doll, than she cried, ""Oh, my!"" and covered up her face.\nThe little maid looked up at me in great wonder, as if I were leading\nher astray; and I felt so angry with Mrs Jones, after all the things I\nhad seen abroad, and even in English churches, that I would not trust\nmyself to speak. However, to pay her out for that, I begged her to cure\nthe mischief herself, which she could not well decline; and some of the\ngreen blind still remaining, Dolly became a most handsome sight, with a\ncrackle in front and a sweeping behind, so that our clerk, a good\nnatured man, was invited to christen her; and ""Patty Green"" was the name\nhe gave: and Bunny\'s doll was nobody. Such a baby-like thing might seem\nalmost below my dignity, and that of all the rest of us; only this child\nhad the power to lead us, as by a special enchantment, back to our own\nchildhood. Moreover, it was needful for me to go through with this\ndoll\'s birth (still more so with her dress, of course, having her a\nfemale), because through her I learned a great deal more of Bardie\'s\nhistory than ever our Bunny could extract.\n\nEverybody who has no patience with the ways of childhood, may be vexed,\nand must be vexed, with our shipwrecked maid for knowing many things,\nbut not the right; but I think she was to blame, only for her innocence.\nIn her tiny brain was moving some uncertain sense of wrong; whether done\nby herself, or to her, was beyond her infant groping. If she could have\nmade her mind up, in its little milky shell, that the evil had befallen,\nwithout harm on her part, doubtless she had done her best to let us know\nthe whole of it. Her best, of course, would be but little, looking at\nher age and so on; and perhaps from some harsh word or frown, stamped\ninto the tender flux of infantile memory, a heavy dread both darkened\nand repressed much recollection. Hence, if one tried to examine her, in\norder to find out who she was, she would shake her head, and say, ""No!\nsompfin;"" as she always did when puzzled or unable to pronounce a word.\nThe only chance of learning even any little things she knew, was to\nleave her to her own way, and not interrupt her conversation with wooden\nor crockery playmates. All of these she endowed with life, having such\npower of life herself, and she reckoned them up for good behaviour, or\nfor bad, as the case might be. And often was I touched at heart, after a\nday of bitter fighting with a world that wronged me, by hearing her in\nbaby-prattle tell her playthings of their unkindness to a little thing\nwith none to love her.\n\nBut when I had finished Patty\'s face up to complete expression, with two\nblack buttons for her eyes, and a cowry for her mouth, and a nose of\ncoral, also a glorious head of hair of crinkled sea-weed growing out of\na shell (toothed like an ivory comb almost), the ecstasy of the child\nwas such, that I obtained, as well as deserved, some valuable\ninformation.\n\n""Patty Geen, \'e\'s been aye good,"" I heard her say in my window-place,\none morning after breakfast; ""and \'e is the most boofely doll ever seen,\nand I tell \'a sompfin; only \'e musn\'t tell anybody, till my dear mama\ncomes. Nat wasn\'t ickle bother, Patty.""\n\n""How do you know, Miss?"" Patty inquired by means of my voice in the\ndistance, and a little art I had learned abroad of throwing it into\ncorners.\n\n""I tell \'a, Patty, I tell \'a. I \'ouldn\'t tell \'e nasty man, but I tell\nold Davy some day. Ickle bother not like nat at all. Ickle bother not so\nbig enough, and only two ickle teeth in front, and his hair all gone\nayay it is, but mama say soon come back again.""\n\n""And what is little brother\'s name?"" said Patty, in a whisper; ""and what\nis your name and papa\'s?""\n\n""Oh, \'e silly Patty Geen! As if \'e didn\'t know I\'se Bardie, ever since I\nwas anytin. And papa, is papa, he is. Patty, I\'se kite ashamed of \'a.\n\'E\'s such a silly ickle fin!""\n\n""Well, I know I am not very clever, Miss. But tell me some more things\nyou remember.""\n\n""I tell \'a, if \'e stop kiet. \'I \'ish \'a many happy turns of the day,\nMiss Bardie. Many happy turns of the day to \'a!\' And poor Bardie get off\nher stool, and say what her dear papa tell. \'Gentleyums and yadies, I\'se\naye much obiged to \'a.\' And then have boofely appledies, and carbies,\nand a ickle dop of good yiney-piney. Does \'e know \'hot that means, poor\nPatty?""\n\n""No, my dear; how should I know?""\n\n""\'E mustn\'t call me \'my dear,\' I tell \'a. \'E must know \'a\'s pace in\nyife. Why, \'e\'s only a doll, Patty, and Bardie\'s a young yady, and a\n\'streamly \'cocious gal I is, and the gentleyums all say so. Ickle bother\ncan\'t say nuffin, without me to sow him the yay of it. But Bardie say\nalmost anyfin; anyfin, when I yikes to ty. Bardie say \'Pomyoleanian\ndog!\'""\n\nThis cost her a long breath, and a great effort; but Patty expressed\nintense amazement at such power of diction, and begged to know something\nmore about that extraordinary animal.\n\n""Pomyoleanian dog is yite, yite all over \'sept his collar, and his\ncollar\'s boo. And he\'s got hair that long, Patty, ever so much longer\nthan yours. And he yun yound and yound, he does. Oh, I do so yant my\nPomyoleanian dog!""\n\nPatty waited for two great tears to run quietly down two little cheeks;\nand then she expressed some contempt of the dog, and a strong desire to\nhear some more about the happy turns of the day.\n\n""Don\'t \'e be jealous, now, Patty, I tell \'a. \'E ickle yite dog can eat,\nbut \'e can\'t. And happy turns of the day is yen a geat big gal is two\nyears old with a ickle bother. And he can\'t say nuffin, \'cos he grow\ntoo strong enough, and \'e young yady must repy; and ayebody yooks at \'a,\nand yaffs, and put \'e gasses up, and say, \'Hot a \'cocious ickle fin!\'\nAnd my dear papa say, \'Hot a good gal!\' and mama come and tiss \'a all\nover a\'most, and then \'e all have some more puddeny-pie!""\n\nOvercome with that last memory, she could go no further; and being\nunable to give her pies, I felt myself bound to abandon any more\ninquiries. For that child scarcely ever roared, so as to obtain relief;\nbut seemed with a kind of self-control--such as unlucky people form,\nhowever early in their lives--to take her troubles inwardly, and to be\nfull to the very lip of them, without the power of spilling. This,\nthough a comfort to other people, is far worse for themselves, I fear.\nAnd I knew that she did love pastry rarely; for one day, after a fine\npair of soles, I said to the two children, ""Now, put your little hands\ntogether, and thank God for a good dinner."" Bunny did this in a grateful\nmanner, but Bardie said, ""No, I \'ont, old Davy; I\'ll thank God when I\ngets puddeny-pie.""\n\nUpon the whole, I concluded thus, that the little creature was after all\n(and as might have been expected with any other child almost) too young,\nin the third year of her age, to maintain any clear ideas of place, or\ntime, or names, or doings, or anything that might establish from her own\nwords only, whence she came or who she was. However, I now knew quite\nenough, if the right people ever came to seek for her, to ""\'dentify""\nher, as she expressed it to that stupid Coroner.\n\nMoxy Thomas came to fetch her back to Sker, in a few days\' time. I was\nnow resolved to keep her, and she resolved to stay with me--and\ndoubtless I had first right to her. But when I saw poor Moxy\'s face, and\ncalled to mind her desolation, and when she kissed my fishy hand to let\nher have this comfort, after all the Lord had taken from her, I could\nnot find it in my heart to stand to my own interest. It came across me\ntoo that Bardie scarcely throve on so much fish; and we never had any\nbutcher\'s meat, or meat of any kind at all, unless I took shares in a\npig, after saving up money for Christmas, or contrived to defend myself\nagainst the hares that would run at me so, when I happened to come\nthrough a gate at night.\n\nSo with a clearly-pronounced brave roar, having more music than Bunny\'s\nin it, and enough to wash a great deal of ""dust"" out of her woefully\nlingering eyes, away she went in Moxy\'s arms, with Patty Green in her\nown looking likely to get wet through. And Bunny stuck her thumbs into\nmy legs, which she had a knack of doing, especially after sucking them;\nso thus we stood, at our cottage door, looking after Bardie; and I took\noff my hat, and she spread her hand out, in the intervals of woe; and\nlittle thought either of us, I daresay, of the many troubles in store\nfor us both.\n\nOnly before that grievous parting, she had done a little thing which\ncertainly did amaze me. And if anybody knows the like, I shall be glad\nto hear of it. I had a snug and tidy locker very near the fireplace,\nwherein I kept some little trifles; such as Bunny had an eye for, but\nwas gradually broken into distant admiration. One morning I came\nsuddenly in from looking to my night-lines, and a pretty scene I saw.\nThe door of my cupboard was wide open, and there stood little Bardie\ngiving a finishing lick to her fingers. Bunny also in the corner, with\nher black eyes staring, as if at the end of the world itself. However,\nher pinafore was full.\n\nNo sooner did my grandchild see me, than she rushed away with shrieks,\ncasting down all stolen goods in agony of conscience. I expected Bardie\nto do the same; but to my great wonderment up she walked and faced me.\n\n""Must I beat poor Patty Geen?"" The tears were in her eyes at having to\npropose so sad a thing. And she stroked the doll, to comfort her.\n\n""Beat poor Patty!"" said I, in amazement. ""Why, what harm has Patty\ndone?""\n\n""Nare she have been, all \'e time, stealing \'a soogar, old Davy!"" And she\nlooked at me as if she had done a good turn by the information. I\nscarcely knew what to do, I declare; for her doll was so truly alive to\nher, that she might and perhaps did believe it. However, I shut her in\nmy little bedroom, until her heart was almost broken; and then I tried\nto reason with her, on the subject of telling lies; but she could not\nunderstand what they were; until I said what I was forced to do, when I\nwent among bad people.\n\nThat evening, after she was gone, and while I was very dull about it,\nfinding poor Bunny so slow and stupid, and nothing to keep me wide\nawake--there I was bound to be wide awake, more than at Petty Sessions\neven, when mine enemies throng against me. For almost before I had\nsmoked two pipes, or made up my mind what to do with myself, finding a\nhollow inside of me, the great posting-coach from Bridgend came up, with\nthe sun setting bright on its varnish, and at my very door it stopped.\nNext to the driver sat a constable who was always unjust to me; and\nfrom the inside came out first Justice Anthony Stew of Pen Coed, as\nodious and as meddlesome a justice of the peace as ever signed a\nwarrant; and after him came a tall elderly gentleman, on whom I had\nnever set eyes before, but I felt that he must be a magistrate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nCROSS-EXAMINATION.\n\n\nThose justices of the peace, although appointed by his Majesty, have\nnever been a comfort to me, saving only Colonel Lougher. They never seem\nto understand me, or to make out my desires, or to take me at my word,\nas much as I take them at theirs. My desire has always been to live in a\npainfully loyal manner, to put up with petty insults from customers who\nknow no better, leaving them to self-reflection, and if possible to\nrepentance, while I go my peaceful way, nor let them hear their money\njingle, or even spend it in their sight. To be pleased and trustful also\nwith the folk who trust in me, and rather to abandon much, and give back\ntwopence in a shilling, than cause any purchaser self-reproach for\nhaving sworn falsely before the bench,--now, if all this would not do,\nto keep me out of the session-books, can any man point out a clearer\nproof of the vicious administration of what they call ""justice"" around\nour parts? And when any trumpery case was got up, on purpose to worry\nand plague me, the only chance left me, of any fair-play, was to throw\nup my day\'s work, and wear out my shoes in trudging to Candleston Court,\nto implore that good Colonel Lougher to happen to sit on the bench that\nday.\n\nWhen those two gentlemen alighted from that rickety old coach, and\nordered that very low constable to pace to and fro at the door of my\nhouse, boldly I came out to meet them, having injured no man, nor done\nharm of any sort that I could think of, lately. Stew came first, a man\nof no lineage, but pushed on by impudence; ""Anthony Stew can look you\nthrough,"" an English poacher said of him; and this he tried always to do\nwith me, and thoroughly welcome he was to succeed.\n\nI will not say that my inner movements may not have been uneasy, in\nspite of all my rectitude; however, I showed their two worships inside,\nin the very host style of the quarter-deck such as I had gathered from\nthat coroneted captain, my proud connection with whom, perhaps, I may\nhave spoken of ere this, or at any rate ought to have done so, for I had\nthe honour of swabbing his pumps for him almost every morning; and he\nwas kind enough to call me ""Davy.""\n\nEvery Briton, in his own house, is bound to do his utmost; so I touched\nmy grey forelock, and made two good bows, and set a chair for each of\nthem, happening to have no more just now, though with plenty of money to\nbuy them. Self-controlled as I always am, many things had tried me, of\nlate, almost to the verge of patience; such imputations as fall most\ntenderly on a sorrowful widower; and my pure admiration of Bardie, and\ncertainty of her lofty birth, had made me the more despise such\nfoulness. So it came to pass that two scandalous men were given over by\nthe doctors (for the pole I had cut was a trifle too thick),\nnevertheless they recovered bravely, and showed no more gratitude\ntowards God, than to take out warrants against me! But their low devices\nwere frustrated by the charge being taken before Colonel Lougher. And\nwhat did that excellent magistrate do? He felt himself compelled to do\nsomething. Therefore he fined me a shilling per head for the two heads\nbroken, with 10s. costs (which he paid, as usual), and gave me a very\nsevere reprimand.\n\n""Llewellyn,"" he said, ""the time is come for you to leave off this course\nof action. I do not wonder that you felt provoked; but you must seek for\nsatisfaction in the legal channels. Suppose these men had possessed thin\nheads, why you might have been guilty of murder! Make out his commitment\nto Cardiff Gaol, in default of immediate payment.""\n\nAll this was good, and sustained one\'s faith in the efficacy of British\nlaw; and trusting that nothing might now be amiss in the minds of these\ntwo magistrates, I fetched the block of sycamore, whereupon my fish were\nin the habit of having their fins and tails chopped off; and there I\nsate down, and presented myself both ready and respectful. On the other\nhand, my visitors looked very grave and silent; whether it were to\nprolong my doubts, or as having doubts of their own, perhaps.\n\n""Your worships,"" I began at last, in fear of growing timorous, with any\nlonger waiting--""your worships must have driven far.""\n\n""To see you, Llewellyn,"" Squire Stew said, with a nasty snap, hoping the\nmore to frighten me.\n\n""Not only a pleasure to me, your worships, but a very great honour to my\npoor house. What will your worships be pleased to eat? Butcher\'s meat I\nwould have had, if only I had known of it. But one thing I can truly\nsay, my cottage has the best of fish.""\n\n""That I can believe,"" said Stew; ""because you sell all the worst to me.\nAnother such a trick, Llewellyn, and I have you in the stocks.""\n\nThis astonished me so much--for his fish had never died over four\ndays--that nothing but my countenance could express my feelings.\n\n""I crave your pardon, Justice Stew,"" said the tall grey gentleman with\nthe velvet coat, as he rose in a manner that overawed me, for he stood a\ngood foot over Anthony Stew, and a couple of inches over me; ""may we not\nenter upon the matter which has led us to this place?""\n\n""Certainly, Sir Philip, certainly,"" Stew replied, with a style which\nproved that Sir Philip must be of no small position; ""all I meant, Sir\nPhilip, was just to let you see the sort of fellow we have to deal\nwith.""\n\n""My integrity is well known,"" I answered, turning from him to the\ngentleman; ""not only in this parish, but for miles and miles round. It\nis not my habit to praise myself; and in truth I find no necessity. Even\na famous newspaper, so far away as Bristol, the celebrated \'Felix\nFarley\'s Journal\'----""\n\n""Just so,"" said the elder gentleman; ""it is that which has brought us\nhere; although, as I fear, on a hopeless errand.""\n\nWith these words he leaned away, as if he had been long accustomed to be\ndisappointed. To me it was no small relief to find their business\npeaceable, and that neither a hare which had rushed at me like a lion\nthrough a gate by moonlight, nor a stupid covey of partridges (nineteen\nin number, which gave me no peace while excluded from my dripping-pan),\nnor even a pheasant cock whose crowing was of the most insulting\ntone,--that none of these had been complaining to the bench emboldened\nme, and renewed my sense of reason. But I felt that Justice Stew could\nnot be trusted for a moment to take this point in a proper light.\nTherefore I kept my wits in the chains, taking soundings of them both.\n\n""Now, Llewellyn, no nonsense, mind!"" began Squire Stew, with his face\nlike a hatchet, and scollops over his eyebrows: ""what we are come for is\nvery simple, and need not unsettle your conscience, as you have allowed\nit to do, I fear. Keep your aspect of innocent wonder for the next time\nyou are brought before me. I only wish your fish were as bright and\nslippery as you are.""\n\n""May I humbly ask what matter it pleases your worship to be thinking\nof?""\n\n""Oh, of course you cannot imagine, Davy. But let that pass, as you were\nacquitted, by virtue of your innocent face, in the teeth of all the\nevidence. If you had only dropped your eyes, instead of wondering so\nmuch--but never mind, stare as you may, some day we shall be sure to\nhave you.""\n\nNow, I will put it to anybody whether this was not too bad, in my own\nhouse, and with the Bench seated on my own best chairs! However, knowing\nwhat a man he was, and how people do attribute to me things I never\ndreamed of, and what little chance a poor man has if he takes to\ncontradiction, all I did was to look my feelings, which were truly\nvirtuous. Nor were they lost upon Sir Philip.\n\n""You will forgive me, good sir, I hope,"" he said to Squire Anthony; ""but\nunless we are come with any charge against this--Mr Llewellyn, it is\nhardly fair to reopen any awkward questions of which he has been\nacquitted. In his own house, moreover, and when he has offered kind\nhospitality to us--in a word, I will say no more.""\n\nHere he stopped, for fear perhaps of vexing the other magistrate; and I\ntouched my grizzled curl and said, ""Sir, I thank you for a gentleman.""\nThis was the way to get on with me, instead of driving and bullying; for\na gentleman or a lady can lead me to any extremes of truth; but not a\nlawyer, much less a justice. And Anthony Stew had no faith in truth,\nunless she came out to his own corkscrew.\n\n""British tar,"" he exclaimed, with his nasty sneer; ""now for some more of\nyour heroism! You look as if you were up for doing something very\nglorious. I have seen that colour in your cheeks when you sold me a\nsewin that shone in the dark. A glorious exploit; wasn\'t it now?""\n\n""That it was, your worship, to such a customer as you.""\n\nWhile Anthony Stew was digesting this, which seemed a puzzle to him, the\ntall grey gentleman, feeling but little interest in my commerce, again\ndesired to hurry matters. ""Forgive me again, I beseech you, good sir;\nbut ere long it will be dark, and as yet we have learned nothing.""\n\n""Leave it all to me, Sir Philip; your wisest plan is to leave it to me.\nI know all the people around these parts, and especially this fine\nfellow. I have made a sort of study of him, because I consider him what\nI may call a thoroughly typical character.""\n\n""I am not a typical character,"" I answered, over-hastily, for I found\nout afterwards what he meant. ""I never tipple; but when I drink, my rule\nis to go through with it.""\n\nSquire Stew laughed loud at my mistake, as if he had been a great\nscholar himself; and even Sir Philip smiled a little in his sweet and\nlofty manner. No doubt but I was vexed for a moment, scenting (though I\ncould not see) error on my own part. But now I might defy them both,\never to write such a book as this. For vanity has always been so foreign\nto my nature, that I am sure to do my best, and, after all, think\nnothing of it, so long as people praise me. And now, in spite of all\nrude speeches, if Sir Philip had only come without that Squire Anthony,\nnot a thing of all that happened would I have retained from him. It is\nhopeless for people to say that my boat crippled speech on my part.\nTush! I would have pulled her plug out on the tail of the Tuskar rather\nthan one moment stand against the light for Bardie.\n\nSquire Stew asked me all sorts of questions having no more substance in\nthem than the blowing-hole at the end of an egg, or the bladder of a\nskate-fish. All of these I answered boldly, finding his foot outside my\nshoes. And so he came back again, as they do after trying foolish\nexcursions, to the very point he started with.\n\n""Am I to understand, my good fellow, that the ship, which at least you\nallow to be wrecked, may have been or might have been something like a\nforeigner?""\n\n""Therein lies the point whereon your worship cannot follow me, any more\nthan could the Coroner. Neither he, nor his clerk, nor the rest of the\njury, would listen to common-sense about it. That ship no more came from\nAppledore than a whale was hatched from a herring\'s egg.""\n\n""I knew it; I knew it,"" broke in Sir Philip. ""They have only small\ncoasters at Appledore. I said that the newspaper must be wrong. However,\nfor the sake of my two poor sons, I am bound to leave no clue\nunfollowed. There is nothing more to be done, Mr Stew, except to express\nmy many and great obligations for your kindness."" Herewith he made a\nmost stately bow, and gave even me a corner of it.\n\n""Stay, Sir Philip; one moment more. This fellow is such a crafty file.\nCertain I am that he never would look so unnaturally frank and candid\nunless he were in his most slippery mood. You know the old proverb, I\ndaresay, \'Put a Taffy on his mettle, he\'ll boil Old Nick in his own\nfish-kettle.\' Dyo, where did your boat come from?""\n\nThis question he put in a very sudden, and I might well say vicious,\nmanner, darting a glance at me like the snake\'s tongues in the island of\nDas Cobras. I felt such contempt that I turned my back, and gave him a\nview of the ""boofely buckens"" admired so much by Bardie.\n\n""Well done!"" he cried. ""Your resources, Dyo, are an infinite credit to\nyou. And, do you know, when I see your back, I can almost place some\nfaith in you. It is broad and flat and sturdy, Dyo. Ah! many a fine hare\nhas swung there head downwards. Nevertheless, we must see this boat.""\n\nNothing irritates me more than what low Englishmen call ""chaff."" I\nlike to be pleasant and jocular upon other people; but I don\'t like\nthat sort of thing tried upon me when I am not in the humour for it.\nTherefore I answered crustily, ""Your worship is welcome to see my boat,\nand go to sea in her if you please, with the plug out of her bottom.\nUnder Porthcawl Point she lies; and all the people there know all about\nher. Only, I will beg your worship to excuse my presence, lest you\nshould have low suspicions that I came to twist their testimony.""\n\n""Well said, David! well said, my fine fellow! Almost I begin to believe\nthee, in spite of all experience. Now, Sir Philip.""\n\n""Your pardon, good sir; I follow you into the carriage.""\n\nSo off they set to examine my boat; and I hoped to see no more of them,\nfor one thing was certain--to wit, that their coachman never would face\nthe sandhills, and no road ever is, or ever can be, to Porthcawl; so\nthat these two worthy gentlemen needs must exert their noble legs for at\nleast one-half of the distance. And knowing that Squire Stew\'s soles\nwere soft, I thought it a blessing for him to improve the only soft part\nabout him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n\nHighly pleased with these reflections, what did I do but take a pipe,\nand sit like a lord at my own doorway, having sent poor Bunny with a\nsmack to bed, because she had shown curiosity: for this leading vice of\nthe female race cannot be too soon discouraged. But now I began to fear\nalmost that it would be growing too dark very soon for me to see what\nbecame of the carriage returning with those two worships. Moreover, I\nfelt that I had no right to let them go so easily, without even knowing\nSir Philip\'s surname, or what might be the especial craze which had led\nthem to honour me so. And sundry other considerations slowly prevailed\nover me; until it would have gone sore with my mind, to be kept in the\ndark concerning them. So, when heavy dusk of autumn drove in over the\nnotch of sandhills from the far-away of sea, and the green of grass was\ngone, and you hardly could tell a boy from a girl among the children\nplaying, unless you knew their mothers; I rejoicing in their pleasures,\nquite forgot the justices. For all our children have a way of letting\nout their liveliness, such as makes old people feel a longing to be in\nwith them. Not like Bardie, of course; but still a satisfactory feeling.\nAnd the better my tobacco grew, the sweeter were my memories.\n\nBefore I had courted my wife and my sweethearts (a dozen and a-half\nperhaps, or at the outside say two dozen) anything more than twice\napiece, in the gentle cud of memory; and with very quiet sighs indeed,\nfor echoes of great thumping ones; and just as I wondered what execution\na beautiful child, with magnificent legs, would do when I lay in the\nchurchyard--all of a heap I was fetched out of dreaming into\ncommon-sense again. There was the great yellow coach at the corner of\nthe old grey wall that stopped the sand; and all the village children\nleft their ""hide-and-seek"" to whisper. Having fallen into a different\nmood from that of curiosity, and longing only for peace just now, or\ntender styles of going, back went I into my own cottage, hoping to hear\nthem smack whip and away. Even my hand was on the bolt--for a bolt I had\nnow on account of the cats, who understand every manner of latch,\nwherever any fish be--and perhaps it is a pity that I did not shoot it.\n\nBut there came three heavy knocks; and I scarcely had time to unbutton\nmy coat, in proof of their great intrusion, before I was forced to show\nmy face, and beg to know their business.\n\n""Now, Dyo, Dyo,"" said that damned Stew [saving your presence, I can\'t\ncall him else]; ""this is a little too bad of you! Retiring ere dusk!\nAha! aha! And how many hours after midnight will you keep your hornpipes\nup, among the \'jolly sailors!\' Great Davy, I admire you.""\n\nI saw that it was not in his power to enter into my state of mind: nor\ncould I find any wit in his jokes, supposing them to be meant for such.\n\n""Well, what did your worships think of Porthcawl?"" I asked, after\nsetting the chairs again, while I bustled about for my tinder-box: ""did\nyou happen to come across the man whose evil deeds are always being\nsaddled upon me?""\n\n""We found a respectable worthy Scotchman, whose name is Alexander\nMacraw; and who told us more in about five minutes than we got out of\nyou in an hour or more. He has given us stronger reason to hope that we\nmay be on the right track at last to explain a most painful mystery, and\nrelieve Sir Philip from the most cruel suspense and anxiety.""\n\nAt these words of Squire Anthony, the tall grey gentleman with the\nvelvet coat bowed, and would fain have spoken, but feared perhaps that\nhis voice would tremble.\n\n""Macraw thinks it highly probable,"" Justice Stew continued, ""that the\nship, though doubtless a foreigner, may have touched on the opposite\ncoast for supplies, after a long ocean voyage: and though Sir Philip has\nseen your boat, and considers it quite a stranger, that proves nothing\neither way, as the boat of course would belong to the ship. But one very\nsimple and speedy way there is of settling the question. You thought\nproper to conceal the fact that the Coroner had committed to your charge\nas foreman of the jury--and a precious jury it must have been--so as to\npreserve near the spot, in case of any inquiry, the dress of the poor\nchild washed ashore. This will save us the journey to Sker, which in the\ndusk would be dangerous. David Llewellyn, produce that dress, under my\nauthority.""\n\n""That I will, your worship, with the greatest pleasure. I am sure I\nwould have told you all about it, if I had only thought of it.""\n\n""Ahem!"" was all Squire Stew\'s reply, for a horribly suspicious man hates\nsuch downright honesty. But without taking further notice of him, I\nwent to my locker of old black oak, and thence I brought that upper\ngarment something like a pinafore, the sight of which had produced so\nstrong an effect upon the Coroner. It was made of the very finest linen,\nand perhaps had been meant for the child to wear in lieu of a frock in\nsome hot climate. As I brought this carefully up to the table, Squire\nStew cried, ""Light another candle,"" just as if I kept the village shop!\nThis I might have done at one time, if it had only happened to me, at\nthe proper period, to marry the niece of the man that lived next door to\nthe chapel, where they dried the tea-leaves. She took a serious liking\nto me, with my navy trousers on; but I was fool enough to find fault\nwith a little kink in her starboard eye. I could have carried on such a\ntrade, with my knowledge of what people are, and description of foreign\nclimates--however, it was not to be, and I had to buy my candles.\n\nAs soon as we made a fine strong light, both the gentlemen came nigh,\nand Sir Philip, who had said so little, even now forbore to speak. I\nheld the poor dress, tattered by much beating on the points of rocks;\nand as I unrolled it slowly, he withdrew his long white hands, lest we\nshould remark their quivering.\n\n""You are not such fools as I thought,"" said Stew; ""it is a coronet\nbeyond doubt. I can trace the lines and crossings, though the threads\nare frayed a little. And here in the corner, a moneygrum--ah! you never\nsaw that, you stupes--do you know the mark, sir?""\n\n""I do not,"" Sir Philip answered, and seemed unable to fetch more words;\nand then like a strong man turned away, to hide all disappointment. Even\nAnthony Stew had the manners to feel that here was a sorrow beyond his\ndepth, and he covered his sense of it, like a gentleman, by some petty\ntalk with me. And it made me almost respect him to find that he dropped\nall his banter, as out of season.\n\nBut presently the tall grey gentleman recovered from his loss of hope,\nand with a fine brave face regarded us. And his voice was firm and very\nsweet.\n\n""It is not right for me to cause you pain by my anxieties; and I fear\nthat you will condemn me for dwelling upon them overmuch. But you, Mr\nStew, already know, and you my friend have a right to know, after your\nkind and ready help, that it is not only the piteous loss of two little\ninnocent children, very dear ones both of them, but also the loss of\nfair repute to an honourable family, and the cruel suspicion cast upon\na fine brave fellow, who would scorn, sir, who would scorn, for the\nwealth of all this kingdom, to hurt the hair of a baby\'s head.""\n\nHere Sir Philip\'s voice was choked with indignation more than sorrow,\nand he sat down quickly, and waved his hand, as much as to say, ""I am an\nold fool, I had much better not pretend to talk."" And much as I longed\nto know all about it, of course it was not my place to ask.\n\n""Exactly, my dear sir, exactly,"" Squire Anthony went on, for the sake of\nsaying something; ""I understand you, my dear sir, and feel for you, and\nrespect you greatly for your manly fortitude under this sad calamity.\nTrust in Providence, my dear sir; as indeed I need not tell you.""\n\n""I will do my best; but this is now the seventh disappointment we have\nhad. It would have been a heavy blow, of course, to have found the poor\nlittle fellow dead. But even that, with the recovery of the other, would\nhave been better than this dark mystery, and, above all, would have\nfreed the living from these maddening suspicions. But as it is, we must\ntry to bear it, and to say, \'God\'s will be done.\' But I am thinking too\nmuch about ourselves. Mr Stew, I am very ungrateful not to think more of\nyour convenience. You must be longing to be at home.""\n\n""At your service, Sir Philip--quite at your service. My time is entirely\nmy own.""\n\nThis was simply a bit of brag; and I saw that he was beginning to\nfidget; for, bold as his worship was on the bench, we knew that he was\nbut a coward at board, where Mrs Stew ruled with a rod of iron: and now\nit was long past dinner-time, even in the finest houses.\n\n""One thing more, then, before we go,"" answered Sir Philip, rising;\n""according to the newspaper, and as I hear, one young maiden was really\nsaved from that disastrous shipwreck. I wish we could have gone on to\nsee her; but I must return to-morrow morning, having left many anxious\nhearts behind. And to cross the sands in the dark, they say, is utterly\nimpossible.""\n\n""Not at all, Sir Philip,"" said I, very firmly, for I honestly wished\nto go through with it; ""although the sand is very deep, there is no\nfear at all, if one knows the track. It is only the cowardice of these\npeople ever since the sand-storm. I would answer to take you in the\ndarkest night, if only I had ever learned to drive,"" But Anthony Stew\nbroke in with a smile, ""It would grieve me to sit behind you, Dyo, and\nI trow that Sir Philip would never behold Appledore again. There is\nnothing these sailors will not attempt.""\n\nAlthough I could sit the bow-thwart of a cart very well, with a boy to\ndrive me, and had often advised the hand at the tiller, and sometimes as\nmuch as held the whip, all this, to my diffidence, seemed too little to\nwarrant me in navigating a craft that carried two horses.\n\nSir Philip looked at me, and perhaps he thought that I had not the cut\nof a coachman. However, all he said was this:\n\n""In spite of your kindness, Mr Stew, and your offer, my good sir""--this\nwas to me, with much dignity--""I perceive that we must not think of it.\nAnd of what use could it be except to add new troubles to old ones? Sir,\nI have trespassed too much on your kindness; in a minute I will follow\nyou."" Anthony Stew, being thus addressed, was only too glad to skip into\nthe carriage. ""By, by, Dyo,"" he cried; ""mend your ways, if you can, my\nman. I think you have told fewer lies than usual; knock off one every\ntime of speaking, and in ten years you will speak the truth.""\n\nOf this low rubbish I took no heed any more than any one would who knows\nme, especially as I beheld Sir Philip signalling with his purse to me,\nso that Stew might not be privy to it. Entering into the spirit of this,\nI had some pleasant memories of gentlemanly actions done by the superior\nclasses towards me, but longer agone than I could have desired. And now\nbeing out of the habit of it, I showed some natural reluctance to begin\nagain, unless it were really worth my while. Sir Philip understood my\nfeelings, and I rose in his esteem, so that half-guineas went back to\nhis pocket, and guineas took the place of them.\n\n""Mr Llewellyn, I know,"" he said, ""that you have served your country\nwell; and it grieves me to think that on my account you have met with\nsome harsh words to-day.""\n\n""If your worship only knew how little a thing of that sort moves me when\nI think of the great injustice. But I suppose it must be expected by a\npoor man such as I am. Justice Stew is spoiled by having so many rogues\nto deal with. I always make allowance for him; and of course I know that\nhe likes to play with the lofty character I bear. If I had his house and\nhis rich estate--but it does not matter--after all, what are we?""\n\n""Ah, you may well say that, Llewellyn. Two months ago I could not have\nbelieved--but who are we to find fault with the doings of our Maker? All\nwill be right if we trust in Him, although it is devilish hard to do.\nBut that poor maid at that wretched place--what is to become of her?""\n\n""She has me to look after her, your worship, and she shall not starve\nwhile I have a penny.""\n\n""Bravely said, Llewellyn! My son is a sailor, and I understand them. I\nknow that I can trust you fully to take charge of a trifle for her.""\n\n""I love the maid,"" I answered truly; ""I would sooner rob myself than\nher.""\n\n""Of course you would, after saving her life. I have not time to say much\nto you, only take this trifle for the benefit of that poor thing.""\n\nFrom a red leathern bag he took out ten guineas, and hastily plunged\nthem into my hand, not wishing Stew to have knowledge of it. But I was\ndesirous that everybody should have the chance to be witness of it, and\nso I held my hand quite open. And just at that moment our Bunny snored.\n\n""What! have you children yourself, Llewellyn? I thought that you were an\nold bachelor.""\n\n""An ancient widower, your worship, with a little grandchild; and how to\nkeep her to the mark, with father none and mother none, quite takes me\noff my head sometimes. Let me light your honour to your carriage.""\n\n""Not for a moment, if you please; I wish I had known all this before. Mr\nStew never told me a word of this.""\n\n""It would have been strange if he had,"" said I; ""he is always so bitter\nagainst me, because he can never prove anything.""\n\n""Then, Llewellyn, you must oblige me. Spend this trifle on clothes and\nthings for that little snorer.""\n\nHe gave me a little crisp affair, feeling like a child\'s caul dried, and\nI thought it was no more than that. However I touched my brow and\nthanked him as he went to the carriage-steps; and after consulting all\nthe village, I found it a stanch pledge from the Government for no less\nthan five pounds sterling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nINTO GOOD SOCIETY.\n\n\nIn spite of all that poor landsmen say about equinoctial gales and so\non, we often have the loveliest weather of all the year in September. If\nthis sets in, it lasts sometimes for three weeks or a month together.\nThen the sky is bright and fair, with a firm and tranquil blue, not so\ndeep of tint or gentle as the blue of spring-tide, but more truly staid\nand placid, and far more trustworthy. The sun, both when he rises over\nthe rounded hills behind the cliffs, and when he sinks into the level of\nthe width of waters, shines with ripe and quiet lustre, to complete a\nyear of labour. As the eastern in the morning, so at sunset the western\nheaven glows with an even flush of light through the entire depth\npervading, and unbroken by any cloud. Then at dusk the dew fog wavers in\nwhite stripes over the meadowland, or in winding combes benighted\npillows down, and leaves its impress a sparkling path for the sun\'s\nreturn. To my mind no other part of the year is pleasanter than this end\nof harvest, with golden stubble, and orchards gleaming, and the\nhedgerows turning red. Then fish are in season, and fruit is wholesome,\nand the smell of sweet brewing is rich on the air.\n\nThis beautiful weather it was that tempted Colonel Lougher and Lady\nBluett to take a trip for the day to Sker. The distance from Candleston\nCourt must be at least two good leagues of sandy road, or rather of sand\nwithout any road, for a great part of the journey. Therefore, instead of\ntheir heavy coach, they took a light two-wheeled car, and a steady-going\npony, which was very much wiser of them. Also, which was wiser still,\nthey had a good basket of provisions, intending to make a long sea-side\nday, and expecting a lively appetite. I saw them pass through Newton as\nI chanced to be mending my nets by the well; and I touched my hat to the\nColonel of course, and took it off to the lady. The Colonel was driving\nhimself, so as not to be cumbered with any servant; and happening to see\nsuch a basket of food, I felt pretty sure there would be some over, for\nthe quality never eat like us. Then it came into my memory that they\ncould not bear Evan Thomas, and it struck me all of a sudden that it\nmight be well worth my while to happen to meet them upon their return,\nbefore they passed any poor houses, as well as to happen to be swinging\nan empty basket conspicuously. It was a provident thought of mine, and\nturned out as well as its foresight deserved.\n\nThey passed a very pleasant day at Sker (as I was told that evening),\npushing about among rocks and stones, and routing out this, that, and\nthe other, of shells and sea-weed and starfish, and all the rest of the\nrubbish, such as amuses great gentry, because they have nothing to do\nfor their living. And though money is nothing to them, they always seem\nto reckon what they find by money-value. Not Colonel Lougher, of course,\nI mean, and even less Lady Bluett. I only speak of some grand people who\ncome raking along our beach. And of all of these there was nobody with\nthe greediness Anthony Stew had. A crab that had died in changing his\nshell would hardly come amiss to him. Let that pass--who cares about\nhim? I wish to speak of better people. The Colonel, though he could not\nkeep ill-will against any one on earth, did not choose to be indebted to\nSker-grange for even so much as a bite of hay for his pony. Partly,\nperhaps, that he might not appear to play false to his own tenantry; for\nthe Nottage farmers, who held of the Colonel, were always at feud with\nEvan Thomas. Therefore he baited the pony himself, after easing off some\nof the tackle, and moored him to an ancient post in a little sheltered\nhollow. Their rations also he left in the car, for even if any one did\ncome by, none would ever think of touching this good magistrate\'s\nproperty.\n\nQuite early in the afternoon, their appetites grew very brisk by reason\nof the crisp sea-breeze and sparkling freshness of the waves.\nAccordingly, after consultation, they agreed that the time was come to\nsee what Crumpy, their honest old butler, had put into the basket. The\nColonel held his sister\'s hand to help her up rough places, and\nbreasting a little crest of rushes, they broke upon a pretty sight,\nwhich made them both say ""hush,"" and wonder.\n\nIn a hollow place of sand, spread with dry white bones, skates\' pouches,\nblades of cuttle-fish, sea-snail shells, and all the other things that\nstorm and sea drive into and out of the sands, a very tiny maid was\nsitting, holding audience all alone. She seemed to have no sense at all\nof loneliness or of earthly trouble in the importance of the moment and\nthe gravity of play. Before her sat three little dolls, arranged\naccording to their rank, cleverly posted in chairs of sand. The one in\nthe middle was ""Patty Green,"" the other two strange imitations\nfashioned by young Watkin\'s knife. Each was urging her claim to shells,\nwhich the mistress was dispensing fairly, and with good advice to each,\nthen laughing at herself and them, and trying to teach them a\nnursery-song, which broke down from forgetfulness. And all the while her\nquick bright face, and the crisp grain of her attitudes, and the jerk of\nher thick short curls, were enough to make any one say, ""What a queer\nlittle soul!"" Therefore it is not to be surprised at that Colonel\nLougher could not make her out, or that while he was feeling about for\nhis eye-glass of best crystal, his sister was (as behoves a female)\nrasher to express opinion. For she had lost a little girl, and sometimes\ngrieved about it still.\n\n""What a queer little, dear little thing, Henry! I never saw such a\nchild. Where can she have dropped from? Did you see any carriage come\nafter us? It is useless to tell me that she can belong to any of the\npeople about here. Look at her forehead, and look at her manners, and\nhow she touches everything! Now did you see that? What a wonderful\nchild! Every movement is grace and delicacy. Oh, you pretty darling!""\n\nHer ladyship could wait no longer for the Colonel\'s opinion (which he\nwas inclined to think of ere he should come out with it), and she ran\ndown the sandhill almost faster than became her dignity. But if she had\nbeen surprised before, how was she astonished now at Bardie\'s reception\nof her?\n\n""Don\'e tush. Knee tushy paw, see voo pay. All \'e dollies is yae good;\njust going to dinny, and \'e mustn\'t \'poil their appeties.""\n\nAnd the little atom arose and moved Lady Bluett\'s skirt out of her magic\ncircle. And then, having saved her children, she stood scarcely up to\nthe lady\'s knee, and looked at her as much as to ask, ""Are you of the\nquality?"" And being well satisfied on that point, she made what the lady\ndeclared to be the most elegant curtsy she ever had seen.\n\nMeanwhile the Colonel was coming up, in a dignified manner, and\nleisurely, perceiving no cause to rush through rushes, and knowing that\nhis sister was often too quick. This had happened several times in the\nmatter of beggars and people on crutches, and skin-collectors, and\nsuchlike, who cannot always be kept out of the way of ladies; and his\nworship the Colonel had been compelled to endeavour to put a stop to it.\nTherefore (as the best man in the world cannot in reason be expected to\nbe in a moment abreast with the sallies of even the best womankind, but\nlikes to see to the bottom of it) the Colonel came up crustily.\n\n""Eleanor, can you not see that the child does not wish for your\ninterference? Her brothers and sisters are sure to be here from Kenfig\nmost likely, or at any rate some of her relations, and busy perhaps with\nour basket.""\n\n""No,"" said the child, looking up at him, ""I\'se got no \'lations now; all\ngone ayae; but all come back de-morrow day.""\n\n""Why, Henry, what are we thinking of? This must be the poor little girl\nthat was wrecked. And I wanted you so to come down and see her; but you\nrefused on account of her being under the care of Farmer Thomas.""\n\n""No, my dear, not exactly that, but on account of the trouble in the\nhouse I did not like to appear to meddle.""\n\n""Whatever your reason was,"" answered the lady, ""no doubt you were quite\nright; but now I must know more of this poor little thing. Come and have\nsome dinner with us, my darling; I am sure you must be hungry. Don\'t be\nafraid of the Colonel. He loves little children when they are good.""\n\nBut poor Bardie hung down her head and was shy, which never happened to\nher with me or any of the common people; she seemed to know, as if by\ninstinct, that she was now in the company of her equals. Lady Bluett,\nhowever, was used to children, and very soon set her quite at ease by\ninviting her dolls, and coaxing them and listening to their histories,\nand all the other little turns that unlock the hearts of innocence. So\nit came to pass that the castaway dined in good society for the first\ntime since her great misfortune. Here she behaved so prettily, and I\nmight say elegantly, that Colonel Lougher (who was of all men the most\nthoroughly just and upright) felt himself bound to confess his error in\ntaking her for a Kenfig nobody. Now, as it happened to be his birthday,\nthe lady had ordered Mr Crumpy, the butler, to get a bottle of the\nchoicest wine, and put it into the hamper without saying anything to the\nColonel, so that she might drink his health, and persuade him to do\nhimself the like good turn. Having done this, she gave the child a drop\nin the bottom of her own wine-glass, which the little one tossed off\nmost fluently, and with a sigh of contentment said--\n\n""I\'se not had a dop of that yiney-piney ever since--sompfin.""\n\n""Why, what wine do you call it, my little dear?"" the Colonel asked,\nbeing much amused with her air of understanding it.\n\n""Doesn\'t \'a know?"" she replied, with some pity; ""nat\'s hot I calls a dop\nof good Sam Paine.""\n\n""Give her some more,"" said the Colonel; ""upon my word she deserves it.\nEleanor, you were right about her; she is a wonderful little thing.""\n\nAll the afternoon they kept her with them, being more and more delighted\nwith her as she began to explain her opinions; and Watty, who came to\nlook after her, was sent home with a shilling in his pocket. And some of\nthe above I learned from him, and some from Mr Crumpy (who was a very\ngreat friend of mine), and a part from little Bardie, and the rest even\nfrom her good ladyship, except what trifles I add myself, being gifted\nwith power of seeing things that happen in my absence.\n\nThis power has been in my family for upwards of a thousand years, coming\nout and forming great bards sometimes, and at other times great\nstory-tellers. Therefore let no one find any fault or doubt any single\nthing I tell them concerning some people who happen just now to be five\nor six shelves in the world above me, for I have seen a great deal of\nthe very highest society when I cleaned my Earl\'s pumps and epaulettes,\nand waited upon him at breakfast; and I know well how those great people\ntalk, not from observation only, but by aid of my own fellow-feeling for\nthem, which, perhaps, owes its power of insight not to my own sagacity\nonly, but to my ancestors\' lofty positions, as poets to royal families.\nNow although I may have mentioned this to the man of the Press--whose\nhat appeared to have undergone Press experience--I have otherwise kept\nit quite out of sight, because every writer should hold himself entirely\nround the corner, and discover his hand, but not his face, to as many as\nkindly encourage him. Of late, however, it has been said--not by people\nof our own parish, who have seen and heard me at the well and elsewhere,\nbut by persons with no more right than power to form opinions--that I\ncannot fail of breaking down when I come to describe great people. To\nthese my answer is quite conclusive. From my long connection with\nroyalty, lasting over a thousand years, I need not hesitate to describe\nthe Prince of Wales himself; and inasmuch as His Royal Highness is not\nof pure ancient British descent, I verily doubt whether he could manage\nto better my humble style to my liking.\n\nEnough of that. I felt doubts at beginning, but I find myself stronger\nas I get on. You may rely upon me now to leave the question to your own\nintelligence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating; and if any one\nfears that I cannot cook it, I only beg him to wait and see.\n\nLady Bluett was taken so much with my Bardie, and the Colonel the\nsame--though he tried at first to keep it under--that nothing except\ntheir own warm kindness stopped them from making off with her. The lady\nhad vowed that she would do so, for it would be so much for the little\nsoul\'s good; and of course, so far as legality went, the Chief-Justice\nof the neighbourhood had more right to her than a common rough farmer.\nBut Watty came down, being sent by Moxy, after he went home with that\nshilling, and must needs make show of it. He came down shyly, from habit\nof nature, to the black eyebrows of the tide, where the Colonel and\nBardie were holding grand play, with the top of the spring running up to\nthem. She was flying at the wink of every wave, and trying to push him\nback into it; and he was laughing with all his heart at her spry ways\nand audacity, and the quickness of her smiles and frowns, and the whole\nof her nature one whirl of play, till he thought nothing more of his\ncoat-tails.\n\n""What do you want here, boy?"" the Colonel asked, being not best pleased\nthat a man of his standing should be caught in the middle of such\nantics.\n\nWatkin opened his great blue eyes, and opened his mouth as well, but\ncould not get steerage-way on his tongue, being a boy of great\nreverence.\n\n""Little fellow, what are you come for?"" with these words he smiled on\nthe boy, and was vexed with himself for frightening him.\n\n""Oh sir, oh sir, if you please, sir, mother says as Miss Delushy must\ncome home to bed, sir.""\n\n""\'E go ayay now, \'e bad Yatkin! I \'ants more pay with my dear Colonel\nYucca.""\n\n""I am not at all sure,"" said the Colonel, laughing, ""that I shall not\nput her into my car, and drive away with her, Watkin.""\n\n""You may go home, my good boy, and tell your mother that we have taken\nthis poor little dear to Candleston."" This, of course, was Lady Bluett.\n\nYou should have seen Watkin\'s face, they told me, when I came to hear of\nit. Betwixt his terror of giving offence, and his ignorance how to\nexpress his meaning, and the sorrow he felt on his mother\'s account, and\nperhaps his own pain also, not a word had he to say, but made a grope\nafter the baby\'s hands. Then the little child ran up to him, and flung\nboth arms around his leg, and showed the stanchness of her breed. Could\nany one, even of six years old, better enter into it?\n\n""I yoves Yatkin. Yatkin is aye good and kind. And I yoves poor Moky. I\n\'ont go ayay till my dear papa and my dear mamma comes for me.""\n\nLady Bluett, being quick and soft, could not keep her tears from\nstarting; and the Colonel said, ""It must be so. We might have done a\ngreat wrong, my dear. Consider all""--and here he whispered out of\nWatkin\'s hearing, and the lady nodded sadly, having known what trouble\nis. But the last words he spoke bravely, ""God has sent her for a comfort\nwhere He saw that it was needed. We must not give way to a passing fancy\nagainst a deep affliction; only we will keep our eyes upon this little\norphan darling.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nSOUND INVESTMENTS.\n\n\nThe spring-tides led me to Sker the next day, and being full early for\nthe ebb, I went in to see what the Colonel had done. For if he should\nhappen to take up the child, she would pass out of my hands altogether,\nwhich might of course be a serious injury, as well as a very great\nhardship. For of Moxy\'s claim I had little fear if it came to a question\nof title, inasmuch as I had made her sign a document prepared and copied\nby myself, clearly declaring my prior right in virtue of rescue and\nprovidential ordinance. But as against Colonel Lougher I durst not think\nof asserting my claims, even if the law were with me; and not only so;\nbut I felt all along that the matter was not one for money to heal, but\na question of the deepest feelings.\n\nAnd now the way in which Moxy came out, while Bardie was making much of\nme (who always saw everything first, of course), and the style of her\nmeddling in between us, led me to know that a man has no chance to be up\nto the tricks of a female. For the dialogue going on between us was of\nthe very simplest nature, as you may judge by the following:--\n\n""Hy\'se \'a been so long, old Davy, afore \'a come to see poor Bardie?""\n\n""Because, my pretty dear, I have been forced to work, all day long\nalmost.""\n\n""Hasn\'t \'a had no time to pay?""\n\n""No, my dear, not a moment to play. Work, work, work! Money, money,\nmoney! Till old Davy is quite worn out.""\n\nI may have put horns to the truth in this. But at any rate not very long\nones. And the child began to ponder it.\n\n""I tell \'a, old Davy, \'hot to do. Susan say to me one day, kite yell, I\namember, ickle Bardie made of money! Does \'a sink so?""\n\n""I think you are made of gold, you beauty; and of diamonds, and the\nRevelations.""\n\n""Aye yell! Then I tell \'a hot to do. Take poor Bardie to markiss, old\nDavy; and \'e get a great big money for her.""\n\nShe must have seen some famous market; for acting everything as she did\n(by means of working face, arms, and legs), she put herself up like a\nfowl in a basket, and spread herself, making the most of her breast, and\nlimping her neck as the dead chickens do. Before I could begin to laugh,\nMoxy was upon us.\n\n""Dyo! Why for you come again? Never you used to come like this. Put down\nDelushy, directly moment. No fish she is for you to catch. When you\nmight have had her, here you left her through the face of everything.\nAnd now, because great Evan\'s staff is cloven, by the will of God, who\ntakes not advantage of him? I thought you would have known better, Dyo.\nAnd this little one, that he dotes upon----""\n\n""It is enough,"" I answered, with a dignity which is natural to me, when\nfemales wound my feelings; ""Madame Thomas, it is enough. I will quit\nyour premises."" With these words I turned away, and never looked over my\nshoulder even, though the little one screamed after me; until I felt\nWatty hard under my stern, and like a kedge-anchor dragging. Therefore,\nI let them apologise; till my desire was to forgive them. And after they\nbrought forth proper things, I denied all evil will, and did my best to\naccomplish it.\n\nMrs Thomas returning slowly to her ancient style with me, as I relaxed\nmy dignity, said that now the little maid was getting more at home with\nthem. Mr Thomas, after what had happened in the neighbourhood--this was\nthe death of her five sons--felt naturally low of spirit; and it was\ngood for him to have a lively child around him. He did not seem quite\nwhat he was. And nothing brought him to himself so much as to watch this\nshadow of life; although she was still afraid of him.\n\nEvery word of this was clear to me. It meant ten times what it\nexpressed. Because our common people have a ""height of kindness,"" some\nwould say, and some a ""depth of superstition,"" such as leads them\ndelicately to slope off their meaning. But in my blunt and sailor\nfashion, I said that black Evan must, I feared, be growing rather shaky.\nI had better have kept this opinion quiet; for Moxy bestowed on me such\na gaze of pity mingled with contempt, that knowing what sort of a man he\nhad been, I felt all abroad about everything. All I could say to myself\nwas this, that the only woman of superior mind I ever had the luck to\ncome across, and carefully keep clear of, had taken good care not to\nhave a husband, supposing there had been the occasion. And I think I\nmade mention of her before; because she had been thrice disappointed;\nand all she said was true almost.\n\nHowever, Sker-house might say just what it pleased, while I had my\nwritten document, and ""Delushy"" herself (as they stupidly called her by\ncorruption of Andalusia) was not inclined to abandon me. And now she\nmade them as jealous as could be, for she clung to me fast with one\nhand, while she spread the beautiful tiny fingers of the other to Moxy,\nas much as to say, ""Interrupt me not; I have such a lot of things to\ntell old Davy.""\n\nAnd so she had without any mistake; and the vast importance of each\nmatter lost nothing for want of emphasis. Patty Green had passed through\na multitude of most surprising adventures, some of them even\ntranscending her larceny of my sugar. Watty had covered himself with\nglory, and above all little ""Dutch,"" the sheep-dog, was now become a\nmost benevolent and protecting power.\n\n""\'Hots \'a think, old Davy? Patty Geen been yecked, she has.""\n\n""\'Yecked!\' I don\'t know what that is, my dear.""\n\n""Ness, I said, \'yecked,\' old Davy; yecked down nare, same as Bardie\nwas.""\n\nIt was clear that she now had taken up with the story which everybody\ntold; and she seemed rather proud of having been wrecked.\n\n""And Patty,"" she went on, quite out of breath; ""Patty \'poiled all her\nboofely cothes: such a mess \'e never see a\'most! And poor Patty go to \'e\nback pit-hole, till \'e boofely Dush yun all into \'e yater.""\n\n""Oh, and Dutch pulled her out again, did she?""\n\n""Ness, and her head come kite out of her neck. But Yatty put \'e guepot\non, and make it much better than ever a\'most.""\n\n""Now, Delushy, what a child you are!"" cried Mrs Thomas, proudly; ""you\nnever told Mr. Llewellyn that you ran into the sea yourself, to save\nyour doll; and drownded you must have been, but for our Watkin.""\n\n""Bardie \'poil her cothes,"" she said, looking rather shy about it:\n""Bardie\'s cothes not boofely now, not same as they used to be.""\n\nBut if she regretted her change of apparel, she had ceased by this time,\nMoxy said, to fret much for her father and mother. For Watkin, or some\none, had inspired her with a most comforting idea--to wit, that her\nparents had placed her there for the purpose of growing faster; and that\nwhen she had done her best to meet their wishes in this respect, they\nwould suddenly come to express their pride and pleasure at her\nmagnitude. Little brother also would appear in state, and so would\nSusan, and find it needful to ascend the dairy-stool to measure her. As\nat present her curly head was scarcely up to the mark of that stool, the\nduty of making a timely start in this grand business of growing became\nat once self-evident. To be ""a geat big gal"" was her chief ambition;\ninasmuch as ""\'hen I\'se a geat big gal, mama and papa be so peased, and\nsay, \'hot a good gal \'e is, Bardie, to do as I tell \'a!""\n\nOften when her heart was heavy in the loneliness of that house, and the\nloss of all she loved, and with dirty things around her, the smile would\ncome back to her thoughtful eyes, and she would open her mouth again for\nthe coarse but wholesome food, which was to make a ""big gal"" of her.\nBelieving herself now well embarked toward this desired magnitude, she\nhad long been making ready for the joy it would secure. ""\'E come and\nsee, old Davy. I sow \'a sompfin,"" she whispered to me, when she thought\nthe others were not looking, so I gave a wink to Moxy Thomas, whose\nmisbehaviour I had overlooked, and humouring the child I let her lead me\nto her sacred spot.\n\nThis was in an unused passage, with the end door nailed to jambs, and\nblack oak-panelling along it, and a floor of lias stone. None in the\nhouse durst enter it except this little creature; at least unless there\nwere three or four to hearten one another, and a strong sun shining. The\nAbbot\'s Walk was its proper name; because a certain Abbot of Neath, who\nhad made too much stir among the monks, received (as we say) his quietus\nthere during a winter excursion; and in spite of all the masses said,\ncould not keep his soul at rest. Therefore his soul came up and down;\nand that is worse than a dozen spirits; for the soul can groan, but the\nspirit is silent.\n\nInto this dark lonely passage I was led by a little body, too newly\ninhabited by spirit to be at all afraid of it. And she came to a\ncupboard door, and tugged, and made a face as usual, when the button was\nhard to move. But as for allowing me to help her,--not a bit of it, if\nyou please. With many grunts and jerks of breath, at last she fetched it\noutward, having made me promise first not to touch, however grand and\ntempting might be the scene disclosed to me.\n\nWhat do you think was there collected, and arranged in such a system\nthat no bee could equal it? Why, every bit of everything that every one\nwho loved her (which amounts to everybody) ever had bestowed upon her,\nfor her own sweet use and pleasure, since ashore she came to us. Not a\nlollipop was sucked, not a bit of ""taffy"" tasted, not a plaything had\nbeen used, but just enough to prove it; all were set in portions four,\ntwo of which were double-sized of what the other two were. Nearly half\nthese things had come, I am almost sure, from Newton; and among the\nchoicest treasures which were stored in scollop shells, I descried one\nof my own buttons which I had honestly given her, because two eyelets\nhad run together; item, a bowl of an unsmoked pipe (which had snapped in\nmy hand one evening); item, as sure as I am alive, every bit of the\nsugar which the Dolly had taken from out my locker.\n\nTimes there are when a hardy man, at sense of things (however childish),\nwhich have left their fibre in him, finds himself, or loses self, in a\nsudden softness. So it almost was with me (though the bait on my hooks\nall the time was drying), and for no better reason than the hopeless\nhopes of a very young child. I knew what all her storehouse meant before\nshe began to tell me. And her excitement while she told me scarcely left\nher breath to speak.\n\n""\'Nat for papa, with \'e kean pipe to \'moke, and \'nat for mamma with \'e\nboofely bucken for her coke, and \'nat for my dear ickle bother, because\nit just fit in between his teeth, and \'nis with \'e \'ooking-gass for\nSusan, because she do her hair all day yong.""\n\nShe held up the little bit of tin, and mimicked Susan\'s self-adornment,\nmaking such a comic face, and looking so conceited, that I felt as if I\nshould know her Susan, anywhere in a hundred of women, if only she\nshould turn up so. And I began to smile a little; and she took it up\ntenfold.\n\n""\'E make me yaff so, I do decare, \'e silly old Davy; I doesn\'t know \'hat\nto do a\'most. But \'e mustn\'t tell anybody.""\n\nThis I promised, and so went a-fishing, wondering what in the world\nwould become of the queerest fish I had ever caught, as well as the\nhighest-flavoured one. It now seemed a toss-up whether or not something\nor other might turn up, in the course of one\'s life, about her. At any\nrate she was doing well, with her very bright spirits to help her, and\neven Black Evan, so broken down as not to be hard upon any one. And as\nthings fell out to take me from her, without any warning, upon the whole\nit was for the best to find the last sight comfortable.\n\nAnd a man of my power must not always be poking after babies, even the\nbest that were ever born. Tush, what says King David, who was a\ngreat-grandfather of mine; less distant than Llewellyn Harper, but as\nmuch respected; in spite of his trying to contribute Jewish blood to the\nlot of us in some of his rasher moments? But ancestor though we\nacknowledge him (when our neighbourhood has a revival), I will not be\ncarried away by his fame to copy, so much as to hearken him. The autumn\nnow grew fast upon us, and the beach was shifting; and neither room nor\ntime remained for preaching under the sandhills, even if any one could\nbe found with courage to sit under them. And as the nights turned cold\nand damp, everybody grumbled much; which was just and right enough, in\nbalance of their former grumbling at the summer drought and heat. And it\nwas mainly this desire not to be behind my neighbours in the comfort and\nthe company of grumbling and exchanging grumbles, which involved me in a\ncourse of action highly lowering to my rank and position in society, but\nwithout which I could never have been enabled to tell this story. And\nyet before entering on that subject, everybody will want to know how I\ndischarged my important and even arduous duties as trustee through Sir\nPhilip\'s munificence for both those little children. In the first place,\nI felt that my position was strictly confidential, and that it would be\na breach of trust to disclose to any person (especially in a loquacious\nvillage) a matter so purely of private discretion. Three parties there\nwere to be considered, and only three, whatever point of view one chose\nto take of it. The first of these was Sir Philip, the second the two\nchildren, and the third of course myself. To the first my duty was\ngratitude (which I felt and emitted abundantly), to the second both zeal\nand integrity; and for myself there was one course only (to which I am\nnaturally addicted), namely, a lofty self-denial. This duty to myself I\ndischarged at once, by forming a stern resolution not to charge either\nof those children so much as a single farthing for taking care of her\nproperty until she was twenty-one years of age. Then as regards the\nsecond point, I displayed my zeal immediately, by falling upon Bunny\nsoon after daylight, and giving her a small-tooth-combing to begin with,\ntill the skin of her hair was as bright as a prawn; after which, without\nany heed whatever of roars, or even kicks, I took a piece of holy-stone,\nand after a rinsing of soda upon her, I cleaned down her planking to\nsuch a degree that our admiral might have inspected her. She was clean\nenough for a captain\'s daughter before, and dandy-trimmed more than need\nhave been for a little craft built to be only a coaster. But now when\nher yelling had done her good, and her Sunday frock was shipped, and her\nblack hair spanked with a rose-coloured ribbon, and the smiles flowed\ninto her face again with the sense of all this smartness, Sir Philip\nhimself would have thought her consistent with the owner of five pounds\nsterling.\n\nAnd as touching the money itself, and the honesty rightly expected from\nme, although the sum now in my hands was larger than it ever yet had\npleased the Lord to send me, for out and out my own, nevertheless there\nwas no such thing as leading me astray about it. And this was the more\nto my credit, because that power of evil, who has more eyes than all the\nangels put together, or, at any rate, keeps them wider open, he came\naft, seeing how the wind was, and planted his hoof within half a plank\nof the tiller of my conscience. But I heaved him overboard at once, and\nlaid my course with this cargo of gold, exactly as if it were shipper\'s\nfreight, under bond and covenant. Although, in downright common-sense,\nhaving Bunny for my grandchild, I also possessed beyond any doubt\nwhatever belonged to Bunny; just as the owner of a boat owns the oars\nand rudder also. And the same held true, as most people would think,\nconcerning Bardie\'s property; for if I had not saved her life, how could\nshe have owned any?\n\nSo far, however, from dealing thus, I not only kept all their money for\nthem, but invested it in the manner which seemed to be most for their\ninterest. To this intent I procured a book for three halfpence (paid out\nof mine own pocket), wherein I declared a partnership, and established a\nfishing association, under the name, style, and description of ""Bardie,\nBunny, Llewellyn, and Co."" To this firm I contributed not only my\nindustry and skill, but also nets, tackle, rods and poles, hooks and\ncorks, and two kettles for bait, and a gridiron fit to land and cook\nwith; also several well-proven pipes, and a perfectly sound tobacco-box.\nEvery one of these items, and many others, I entered in the ledger of\npartnership; and Mother Jones, being strange to much writing, recorded\nher mark at the bottom of it (one stroke with one hand and one with the\nother), believing it to be my testament, with an Amen coming after it.\n\nBut knowing what the tricks of fortune are, and creditors so\nunreasonable, I thought it much better to keep my boat outside of the\nassociation. If the firm liked, they might hire it, and have credit\nuntil distribution-day, which I fixed for the first day of every three\nmonths. My partners had nothing to provide, except just an anchor, a\nmast, and a lug-sail, a new net or two, because mine were wearing, and\none or two other trifles perhaps, scarcely worth describing. For after\nall, who could be hard upon them, when all they contributed to the firm\nwas fifteen pounds and ten shillings?\n\nIt was now in the power of both my partners to advance towards fortune;\nto permit very little delay before they insisted on trebling their\ncapital; and so reinvest it in the firm; and hence at the age of\ntwenty-one, be fit to marry magistrates. And I made every preparation to\ncarry their shares of the profits over. Nevertheless, things do not\nalways follow the line of the very best and soundest calculations. The\nfish that were running up from the Mumbles, fast enough to wear their\nfins out, all of a sudden left off altogether, as if they had heard of\nthe association. Not even a twopenny glass of grog did I ever take out\nof our capital, nor a night of the week did I lie abed, when the lines\nrequired attendance. However, when fish are entirely absent, the very\nbest fishermen in the world cannot manage to create them; and therefore\nour partnership saw the wisdom of declaring no dividends for the first\nquarter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nA LONG GOOD-BYE.\n\n\nIt is an irksome task for a man who has always stood upon his position,\nand justified the universal esteem and respect of the neighbourhood, to\nhave to recount his own falling off, and loss of proper station, without\nbeing able to render for it any cause or reason, except indeed his own\ngreat folly, with fortune too ready to second it. However, as every\ndownfall has a slope which leads towards it, so in my case small\ndownhills led treacherously to the precipice. In the first place, the\ndog-fish and the sting-rays (which alone came into the nets of our new\nassociation) set me swearing very hard; which, of course, was a trifling\nthing, and must have befallen St Peter himself, whose character I can\nwell understand. But what was wrong in me was this, that after it went\non for a fortnight, and not even a conger turned up, I became proud of\nmy swearing with practice, instead of praying to be forgiven, which I\nalways feel done to me, if desired. For my power of words began to\nplease me--which was a bait of the devil, no doubt--as every tide I felt\nmore and more that married life had not deprived me of my gift of\nlanguage; or, at any rate, that widowership had restored my vigour\npromptly.\n\nAfter this, being a little exhausted, for two days and two nights I\nsmoked pipes. Not in any mood soever unfit for a Christian; quite the\ncontrary, and quite ready to submit to any discipline; being ordered\nalso to lay by, and expect a sign from heaven. And at this time came\nseveral preachers; although I had very little for them, and was grieved\nto disappoint their remembrance of the ham that my wife used to keep in\ncut. And in so many words I said that now I was bound to the Church by a\ncontract of a shilling a-week, and if they waited long enough, they\nmight hear the clock strike--something. This, combined with a crab whose\nsubstance had relapsed to water, and the sign of nothing in my locker\nexcept a pint of peppermint, induced these excellent pastors to go; and\nif they shook off (as they declared) the dirt of their feet at me, it\nmust have been much to their benefit. This trifle, however, heaped up my\ngrievance, although I thought scorn to think of it; and on the back of\nit there came another wrong far more serious. Tidings, to wit, of a\nwretched warrant being likely to issue against me from that low tyrant\nAnthony Stew, on a thoroughly lying information by one of his own\ngamekeepers. It was true enough that I went through his wood, with a\ncouple of sailors from Porthcawl; by no means with any desire to harm,\nbut to see if his game was healthy. Few things occur that exalt the mind\nmore than natural history; and if a man dare not go into a wood, how can\nhe be expected to improve his knowledge? Tho other men perhaps employed\ntheir means to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with the structure\nand methods of various creatures, going on two legs, or going on four;\nbut as for myself, not so much as a gun did any one see in my hands that\nday.\n\nAt first I thought of standing it out on the strength of all my glory;\nbut knowing what testimony is, when it gets into the mouths of\ngamekeepers, and feeling my honour concerned, to say nothing of the\nother fellows (who were off to sea), also cherishing much experience of\nthe way Stew handled me, upon the whole I had half a mind to let the\nneighbourhood and the county learn to feel the want of me.\n\nAlso what Joe Jenkins said perhaps had some effect on me. This was a\nyoung fellow of great zeal, newly appointed to Zoar Chapel, instead of\nthe steady Nathaniel Edwards, who had been caught sheep-stealing; and\ninasmuch as the chapel stood at the western end of the village, next\ndoor to the ""Welcome to Town, my Lads,"" all the maids of Newton ran\nmightily to his doctrine. For he happened to be a smart young fellow,\nand it was largely put abroad that an uncle of his had a butter-shop,\nwithout any children, and bringing in four pounds a-week at Chepstow.\n\nThere is scarcely a day of my life on which I do not receive a lesson:\nand the difference betwixt me and a fool is that I receive, and he\nscorns it. And a finer lesson I have rarely had than for letting Joe\nJenkins into my well-conducted cottage, for no better reason than that\nthe ""Welcome to Town"" was out of beer. I ought to have known much\nbetter, of course, with a fellow too young to shave himself, and myself\na good hearty despiser of schism, and above all having such a fine\nconnection with the Church of England. But that fellow had such a\ntongue--they said it must have come out of the butter. I gave him a\nglass of my choicest rum, when all he deserved was a larruping. And I\nnearly lost the church-clock through it.\n\nWhen I heard of this serious consequence, I began to call to mind, too\nlate, what the chaplain of the Spitfire--32-gun razy--always used to say\nto us; and a finer fellow to stand to his guns, whenever it came to\nclose quarters, I never saw before or since. ""Go down, parson, go down,""\nwe said; ""sir, this is no place for your cloth."" ""Sneaking schismatics\nmay skulk,"" he answered, with the powder-mop in his hand; for we had\nimpressed a Methody, who bolted below at exceeding long range; ""but if\nmy cloth is out of its place, I\'ll fight the devil naked."" This won over\nto the side of the Church every man of our crew that was gifted with any\nperception of reasoning.\n\nHowever, I never shall get on if I tell all the fine things I have seen.\nOnly I must set forth how I came to disgrace myself so deeply that I\ncould not hope for years and years to enjoy the luxury of despising so\nmuch as a lighterman again. The folk of our parish could hardly believe\nit; and were it to be done in any way consistent with my story, I would\nnot put it on paper now. But here it is. Make the worst of it. You will\nfind me redeem it afterwards. The famous David Llewellyn, of His\nMajesty\'s Royal Navy, took a berth in a trading-schooner, called the\n""Rose of Devon!""\n\nAfter such a fall as this, if I happened to speak below my mark, or not\ndescribe the gentry well, everybody must excuse me: for I went so low in\nmy own esteem, that I could not have knocked even Anthony Stew\'s\nunder-keeper down! I was making notes, here and there, already,\nconcerning the matters at Sker House, and the delicate sayings of\nBardie, not with any view to a story perfect and clear as this is, but\nfor my own satisfaction in case of anything worth going on with. And but\nfor this forethought, you could not have learned both her sayings and\ndoings so bright as above. And now being taken away from it, I tried to\nfind some one with wit enough to carry it on in my absence. In a\npopulous neighbourhood this might have been; but the only man near us\nwho had the conceit to try to carry it on a bit, fell into such a\ncondition of mind that his own wife did not know him. But in spite of\nthe open state of his head, he held on very stoutly, trying to keep\nhimself up to the mark with ale, and even Hollands; until it pleased God\nthat his second child should fall into the chicken-pox; and then all the\nneighbours spoke up so much--on account of his being a tailor--that it\ncame to one thing or the other. Either he must give up his trade, and\nlet his apprentice have it--to think of which was worse than gall and\nwormwood to his wife--or else he must give up all meddling with pen and\nink and the patterns of chicken-pox. How could he hesitate, when he knew\nthat the very worst tailor can make in a day as much as the best writer\ncan in a month?\n\nUpon the whole I was pleased with this; for I never could bear that\nrogue of a snip, any more than he could put up with me for making my own\nclothes and Bunny\'s. I challenged him once on a buttonhole, for I was\nhis master without a thimble. And for this ninth part of a man to think\nof taking up my pen!\n\nThe name of our schooner, or rather ketch--for she was no more than that\n(to tell truth), though I wished her to be called a ""schooner""--was, as\nI said, the ""Rose of Devon,"" and the name of her captain was ""Fuzzy.""\nNot a bad man, I do believe, but one who almost drove me wicked, because\nI never could make him out. A tender and compassionate interest in the\naffairs of everybody, whom it pleases Providence that we should even\nhear of, has been (since our ancestors baffled the Flood, without\nconsulting Noah) one of the most distinct and noblest national traits of\nWelshmen. Pious also; for if the Lord had not meant us to inquire, He\nnever would have sent us all those fellow-creatures to arouse unallayed\ndisquietude. But this man ""Fuzzy,"" as every one called him, although his\ntrue name was ""Bethel Jose,"" seemed to be sent from Devonshire for the\nmere purpose of distracting us. Concerning the other two\n""stone-captains"" (as we call those skippers who come for limestone, and\nsteal it from Colonel Lougher\'s rocks), we knew as much as would keep us\ngoing whenever their names were mentioned; but as to Fuzzy, though this\nwas the third year of his trading over, there was not a woman in Newton\nwho knew whether he had a wife or not! And the public eagerness over\nthis subject grew as the question deepened; until there were seven of\nour best young women ready to marry him, at risk of bigamy, to find out\nthe matter and to make it known.\n\nTherefore, of course, he rose more and more in public esteem, voyage\nafter voyage; and I became jealous, perhaps, of his fame, and resolved\nto expose its hollow basis, as compared with that of mine. Accordingly,\nwhen it came to pass that my glory, though still in its prime, was\nimperilled by that Irish Stew\'s proceedings--for he must have been Irish\nby origin--having my choice (as a matter of course) among the three\nstone captains, I chose that very hard stone to crack; and every one\nall through the village rejoiced, though bitterly grieved to lose me,\nand dreading the price there would be for fish, with that extortionate\nSandy Macraw left alone to create a monopoly. There was not a man in all\nNewton that feared to lay half-a-crown to a sixpence that I brought back\nthe whole of old Fuzzy\'s concerns: but the women, having tried Skipper\nJose with everything they could think of, and not understanding the odds\nof betting, were ready to lay a crooked sixpence on Fuzzy, whenever they\nhad one.\n\nTo begin with, he caught me on the hop; at a moment of rumours and\nserious warnings, and thoroughly pure indignation on my part. At the\nmoment, I said (and he made me sign) that I was prepared to ship with\nhim. After which he held me fast, and frightened me with the land-crabs,\nand gave me no chance to get out of his jaws. I tried to make him laugh\nwith some of the many jokes and stories, which everybody knows of mine,\nand likes them for long acquaintance\' sake. However, not one of them\nmoved him so much as to fetch one squirt of tobacco-juice. This alone\nenabled him to take a strong lead over me. Every time that he was bound\nto laugh, according to human nature, and yet had neither a wag in his\nnose, nor a pucker upon his countenance, nor even so much as a gleam in\nhis eye, so many times I felt in my heart that this man was the wise\nman, and that laughter is a folly. And I had to bottle down the laughs\n(which always rise inside of me, whenever my joke has the cream on it)\nuntil I could find some other fellow fit to understand me; because I\nknew that my jokes were good.\n\nWhen I found no means of backing out from that degrading contract, my\nvery first thought was to do strict justice to our association, and\natone for the loss of my services to it. Therefore, in case of anything\nundesirable befalling me--in short, if I should be ordered aloft with no\nleave to come down again--there I made my will, and left my property to\nestablish credit, for a new start among them. Chairs and tables, knives\nand forks, iron spoons, brought into the family by my wife\'s\ngrandfather, several pairs of duds of my own, and sundry poles, as\nbefore described, also nets to a good extent--though some had gone under\nusury--bait-kettles, I forget how many, and even my character in a\nsilk-bag; item, a great many sundry things of almost equal value; the\nwhole of which I bravely put into my will, and left them. And knowing\nthat the proper thing is to subscribe a codicil, therein I placed a set\nof delf, and after that my blessing. Eighteenpence I was compelled to\npay for this pious document to a man who had been turned out of the law\nbecause he charged too little. And a better shilling-and-sixpence worth\nof sense, with heads and tails to it, his lordship the Bishop of\nLlandaff will own that he never set seal upon; unless I make another\none. Only I felt it just to leave my boat entire to Bardie.\n\nHaving done my duty thus, I found a bracing strength upon me to go\nthrough with everything. No man should know how much I felt my violent\ndegradation from being captain of a gun, to have to tread mercantile\nboards! Things have changed since then so much, through the parsimony of\nGovernment, that our very best sailors now tail off into the Merchant\nservice. But it was not so, when I was young; and even when I was turned\nof fifty, we despised the traders. Even the largest of their vessels, of\nfour or as much as five hundred tons, we royal tars regarded always as\nso many dust-bins with three of the clothes-props hoisted. And now, as I\nlooked in the glass, I beheld no more than the mate of a fifty-ton\nketch, for a thirty-mile voyage out of Newton bay!\n\nHowever, I had lived long enough then to be taught one simple thing.\nWhatever happens, one may descry (merely by using manly aspect) dawning\nglimpses of that light which the will of God intended to be joy for all\nof us; but so scattered now and vapoured by our own misdoings, still it\nwill come home some time, and then we call it ""comfort.""\n\nAccordingly, though so deeply fallen in my own regard, I did not find\nthat people thought so very much the less of me. Nay, some of them even\ndrove me wild, by talking of my ""rise in life,"" as if I had been a pure\nnobody! But on the whole we learned my value, when I was going away from\nus. For all the village was stirred up with desire to see the last of\nme. My well-known narratives at the well would be missed all through the\nautumn; and those who had dared to call them ""lies,"" were the foremost\nto feel the lack of them. Especially the children cried ""Old Davy going\nto be drownded! No more stories at the well!"" Until I vowed to be back\nalmost before they could fill their pitchers.\n\nThese things having proved to me, in spite of inordinate modesty, that I\nhad a certain value, I made the very best of it; and let everybody know\nhow much I wished to say ""Good-bye"" to them, although so short of money.\nFrom ""Felix Farley"" I had received no less than seven-and-tenpence--for\nsaving the drowned black people--under initials ""D. L."" at the office;\naccruing to a great extent from domestic female servants. Some of these\ncraved my candid opinion as to accepting the humble addresses of\ncoloured gentlemen in good livery, and whether it made so much\ndifference. And now I thought that Newton might have a mark of esteem\nprepared for me.\n\nBut though they failed to think of that--purely from want of\nexperience--everything else was done that could be done for a man who\nhad no money, by his neighbours who had less; and sixpence never entered\ntwice into the thoughts of any one. Richard Matthews, the pilot,\npromised to mind the church-clock for me, without even handling my\nsalary. As for Bunny, glorification is the shortest word I know. A young\nman, who had never paid his bill, put her into two-inch ribbon from the\nBaptist preacher\'s shop. Also a pair of shoes upon her, which had right\nand left to them, although not marked by nature. And upon the front of\nher bosom, lace that made me think of smuggling; and such as that young\nman never could have expected to get booked to him, if he had felt\nhimself to be more than a month converted.\n\nMoreover, instead of Mother Jones (who was very well in her way, to be\nsure), the foremost folk in all the village, and even Master Charles\nMorgan himself, carpenter and churchwarden, were beginning to vie, one\nwith the other, in desire to entertain her, without any word of her\nfive-pound note. In short, many kind things were said and done; enough\nto make any unbashful man desire to represent them. But I, for my part,\nwas quite overcome, and delivered my speech with such power of doubt\nconcerning my own worthiness, that they had to send back to the inn\nthree times, before they could properly say ""Good-bye.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nBRAUNTON BURROWS.\n\n\nThe weather was still as fair as could be, with a light wind from the\neast-north-east; and as our course lay west by south, and the ebb was\nrunning, we slipped along at the rate of six or seven knots an hour,\nthough heavily-laden with the Colonel\'s rocks; and after rounding\nPorthcawl Point we came abreast of the old Sker House a little after\nsunset. Skipper Jose would never have ventured inside the Sker-weathers,\nonly that I held the tiller, and knew every vein of sand and rock. And I\nkept so close in shore, because one of the things that vexed me most in\nall this sudden departure, was to run away without proper ceremony from\nBardie. She was certain to feel it much, and too young to perceive the\nnecessity; and fried pudding had been promised her at my table come the\nvery next Sunday.\n\nThe windows of the old grey mansion gleamed in the fading western light,\nbut we descried no smoke or movement, neither any life or variance, only\na dreary pile of loneliness in the middle of yellow sands. Then I rigged\nout my perspective glass, and levelled it on the cuddy chimney--for the\nketch was a half-decker--to spy if the little one might so chance to be\nmaking her solitary play, as she was used to do all day, and most of all\nere bedtime. And if she should so happen, I knew how wild her delight\nwould be to discover a vessel so near the shore; because whenever a sail\nwent by, even at two or three leagues of distance, there was no\ncontaining her. Out she would rush with her face on fire, and curly hair\nall jogging, and up would go two little hands, spread to the sky and the\nvast wide sea. ""Mammy dear, I \'ants \'a so. Dear papa, I has yaited so\nyong. Ickle bother, such a lot of things Bardie\'s got to tell \'a."" And\nthus she would run on the brink of the waves with hope and sadness\nfluctuating on her unformed countenance, until the sail became a speck.\nHowever, now I saw no token of this little rover, unless it were some\nwashed clothes flapping on the rushen tufts to dry; and Jose called me\nback to my spell at the helm before I had finished gazing. And in less\nthan half an hour the landmark of the ancient house was fading in the\ndew-fog.\n\nOur ship\'s company amounted to no less than four, all hands told--viz.,\nCaptain Bethel Jose, _alias_ Fuzzy; Isaac Hutchings, the mate; my humble\nself (who found it my duty to supersede Ikey and appoint myself); and a\nboy of general incapacity, and of the name of ""Bang.""\n\nMaking fine weather as we did, and with myself at the helm all night,\nand taking command (as my skill required), we slanted across Channel\nvery sweetly; and when the grey of morning broke, Lundy Isle was on our\nlee-bow. Hereupon I gave the helm to old Ike, for beyond this was\nunknown to me, and Providence had never led me over Barnstaple bar as\nyet. So I tumbled in, and turned up no more until we were close on the\nbar itself, about ten o\'clock of the forenoon. This is a thoroughly\ndangerous place, a meeting of treacherous winds and waters, in amongst\nuncertain shoaling, and would be worse than our Sker-weathers if it lay\nopen to south-west gales. We waited for the tide, and then slipped over\nvery cleverly, with Hartland Point on our starboard beam; and presently\nwe found ourselves in a fine broad open water, with plenty of grey\nstretch going along it, and green hills tufting away from it. Everything\nlooked so mild and handsome, that I wondered whether these men of\nDevonshire might not be such fools for bragging after all, when tested.\n\nBecause, when I found no means to escape this degrading voyage to\nDevonshire, I had said to myself that at any rate it would enable me to\npeg down those people for the future. Not that they boasted, so to\nspeak, but that they held their tongues at our boasts; as much as to\nsay, ""You may talk if you please; it does you good; and our land is such\nthat we never need contradict you.""\n\nBut now when I saw these ins and outs, and ups and downs, and cornering\nplaces, and the wrinkles of the valleys, and the cheeks of the very\nrocks, set with green as bright and lively (after a burning summer) as\nour own country can show in May, I began to think--though I would not\nsay it, through patriotic unwillingness--that the people who lived in\nsuch land as this could well afford to hold their tongues, and hearken\nour talk with pleasure. Captain Fuzzy said no word, to show that he was\nhome again; neither did he care to ask my opinion about the look of it.\nAnd old Ike treating me likewise, though he ought to have known much\nbetter, there I found myself compelled by my natural desire to know all\nabout my fellow-creatures, to carry on what must have been a most highly\nflattering patronage towards the boy who did our slop-work, and whose\nname was ""Bang,"" because everybody banged him.\n\nThis boy, forgetting the respect which is due to the mate of a ship of\ncommerce--for I now assumed that position legally, over the head of old\nIkey, who acknowledged my rank when announced to him--this ignorant boy\nhad the insolence to give me a clumsy nudge, and inquire--\n\n""Du \'e knaw thiccy peart over yanner? Them down-plasses, and them zandy\nbacks?""\n\n""My boy,"" I replied, ""I have not the honour of knowing anything about\nthem. Very likely you think a good deal of them.""\n\n""Whai, thee must be a born vule. Them be Braunton Burrusses!""\n\n""Be them indeed? Take this, my boy, for such valuable information."" And\nI gave him a cuff of an earnest nature, such as he rarely obtained,\nperhaps, and well calculated to be of timely service to him. He howled a\ngood bit, and attempted to kick; whereupon I raised him from his natural\nlevel, and made his head acquainted with the nature of the foremast,\npreserving my temper quite admirably, but bearing in mind the great\nimportance of impressing discipline at an early age. And I reaped a\nwell-deserved reward in his lifelong gratitude and respect.\n\nWhile Bang went below to complete his weeping, and to find some plaster,\nI began to take accurate observation of these Braunton Burrows, of which\nI had often heard before from the Devonshire men, who frequent our coast\nfor the purpose of stealing coal or limestone. An up-and-down sort of a\nplace it appeared, as I made it out with my spy-glass; and I could not\nperceive that it beat our sands, as those good people declared of it.\nOnly I noticed that these sandhills were of a different hue from ours.\nNot so bare and yellow-faced, not so swept by western winds, neither\nwith their tops thrown up like the peak of a new volcano. Rushes,\nspurge, and goose-foot grasses, and the rib-leafed iris, and in hollow\nplaces cat\'s-mint, loose-strife, and low eye-bright--these and a\nthousand other plants seemed to hold the flaky surface so as not to fly\nlike ours. Ike broke silence, which to him was worse than breaking his\nown windows, and said that all for leagues around was full of giants and\ngreat spectres. Moreover, that all of it long had been found an unkid\nand unholy place, bad for a man to walk in, and swarming with great\ncreatures, striped the contrary way to all good-luck, and having eight\nlegs every side, and a great horn crawling after them. And their food\nall night was known to be travellers\' skulls and sailors\' bones. Having\nseen a good deal of land-crabs, I scarcely dared to deny the story, and\nyet I could hardly make it out. Therefore, without giving vent to\nopinions of things which might turn out otherwise, I levelled my\nspy-glass again at the region of which I had heard such a strange\naccount. And suddenly here I beheld a man of no common appearance,\nwandering in and out the hollows, as if he never meant to stop; a tall\nman with a long grey beard, and wearing a cocked-hat like a colonel.\nThere was something about him that startled me, and drew my whole\nattention. Therefore, with my perspective glass not long ago cleaned,\nand set ship-shape by a man who understood the bearings--after that\nrogue of a Hezekiah had done his best to spoil it--with this honest\nmagnifier (the only one that tells no lies) I carefully followed up and\ndown the figure, some three cables\'-lengths away, of this strange walker\namong the sandhills. We were in smooth water now, gliding gently up the\nriver, with the mainsail paying over just enough for steerage-way; and\nso I got my level truly, and could follow every step.\n\nIt was a fine old-fashioned man, tall and very upright, with a broad\nribbon upon his breast, and something of metal shining; and his Hessian\nboots flashed now and then as he passed along with a stately stride. His\nbeard was like a streak of silver, and his forehead broad and white; but\nall the rest of his face was dark, as if from foreign service. His dress\nseemed to be of a rich black velvet, very choice and costly, and a long\nsword hung at his side, although so many gentlemen now have ceased to\ncarry even a rapier. I like to see them carry their swords--it shows\nthat they can command themselves; but what touched me most with feeling\nwas his manner of going on. He seemed to be searching, ever searching,\nup the hills and down the hollows, through the troughs and on the\nbreastlands, in the shadow and the sunlight, seeking for some precious\nloss.\n\nAfter watching this figure some little time, it was natural that I\nshould grow desirous to know something more about him; especially as I\nobtained an idea, in spite of the distance and different dress, that I\nhad seen some one like this gentleman not such a very long time ago. But\nI could not recall to my mind who it was that was hovering on the skirts\nof it; therefore I looked around for help. Ike Hutchings, my under-mate,\nwas at the tiller, but I durst not lend him my glass, because he knew\nnot one end from the other; so I shouted aloud for Captain Jose, and\nbegged him to take a good look, and tell me everything that he knew or\nthought. He just set his eye, and then shut up the glass, and handed it\nto me without a word and walked off, as if I were nobody! This vexed me,\nso that I holloaed out: ""Are all of you gone downright mad on this side\nof the Channel? Can\'t a man ask a civil question, and get a civil\nanswer?""\n\n""When he axeth what consarneth him,"" was the only answer Captain Fuzzy\nvouchsafed me over his shoulder.\n\nI could not find it worth my while to quarrel with this ignorant man for\nthe sake of a foolish word or two, considering how morose he was, and\nkept the keys of everything. For the moment, I could not help regretting\nmy wholesome chastisement of the boy Bang; for he would have told me at\nleast all he knew, if I could have taught him to take a good look. And\nas for Ike, when I went and tried him, whether it was that he failed of\nmy meaning, or that he chose to pretend to do so (on account of my\nhaving deposed him), or that he truly knew nothing at all--at any rate,\nI got nothing from him. This was, indeed, a heavy trial. It is\nacknowleged that we have such hearts, and strength of goodwill to the\nuniverse, and power of entering into things, that not a Welshman of us\nis there but yearns to know all that can be said about every one he has\never seen, or heard, or even thought of. And this kind will, instead of\nbeing at all repressed by discouragement, increases tenfold in\nproportion as others manifest any unkind desire to keep themselves out\nof the way of it. My certy, no low curiosity is this, but lofty\nsympathy.\n\nMy grandfather nine generations back, Yorath the celebrated bard, begins\nperhaps his most immortal ode to a gentleman who had given him a quart\nof beer with this noble moral precept: ""Lift up your eyes to the castle\ngates and behold on how small a hinge they move! The iron is an inch and\na quarter thick, the gates are an hundred and fifty feet wide!"" And\nthough the gates of my history are not quite so wide as that, they often\nmove on a hinge even less than an inch and a quarter in thickness;\nthough I must not be too sure, of course, as to the substance of Bang\'s\nhead. However, allow even two inches for it, and it seems but a very\ntrifling matter to tell as it did upon great adventures. The boy was as\nsound as a boy need be in a couple of hours afterwards, except that he\nhad, or pretended to have, a kind of a buzzing in one ear; and I found\nhim so grateful for my correction, that I could not bear to urge his\nhead with inquiries for the moment.\n\nTo Captain Fuzzy I said no more. If he could not see the advantage of\nattending to his own business, but must needs go out of his way to\nadminister public reproof to me, I could only be sorry for him. To Ikey,\nhowever, I put some questions of a general tendency; but from his\nbarbarous broken English--if this jargon could be called English at\nall--the only thing I could gather was, that none but true Devonshire\nfolk had a right to ask about Devonshire families. This might be true\nto a certain extent, though I never have seen such a law laid down. The\nanswer, however, is perfectly simple. If these people carry on in a\nmanner that cannot fail to draw public attention, they attack us at once\non our tenderest point, and tenfold so if they are our betters; for what\nman of common-sense could admit the idea of anybody setting up to be\nnobody? Therefore I felt myself quite ready to give a week\'s pay and\nvictuals, in that state of life to which God alone could have seen fit\nto call me--as mate of that Devonshire ketch, or hoy, or tub, or\nwhatever it might be--four shillings and a bag of suet-dumplings, twice\na-day, I would have given, to understand upon the spot all about that\nelderly gentleman.\n\nIt helped me very little, indeed, that I kept on saying to myself, ""This\nmatters not; \'tis a few hours only. The moment we get to Barnstaple, I\nshall find some women;--the women can never help telling everything, and\nfor the most part ten times that. Only contradict them bravely, and they\nhave no silence left."" However, it helped me not a little when Captain\nFuzzy, with a duck of his head, tumbled up from the cuddy, brimful, as\nwe saw, of the dinner-time. A man of my experience, who has lived for\nsix weeks on the horns of sea-snails, which the officers found too hard\nfor them, that time we were wrecked in the Palamede--what can a man of\nthis kind feel when a trumpery coaster dares to pipe all hands to\ndinner?\n\nHowever, it so happened for the moment that what I felt was appetite:\nand Fuzzy, who was a first-rate cook, and knew seasoning without\ncounting, had brought an iron ladle up, so as to save his words, and yet\nto give us some idea. Soup it was of a sort, that set us thinking of all\nthe meat under it. I blew upon it, and tasted a drop, and found that\nother people\'s business would keep till at least after dinner. In the\nmidst of dinner we came to the meeting of two fine rivers, called Tawe\nand Torridge, and with the tide still making strong we slanted up the\nformer. The channel was given to twists and turns, but the fine open\nvalley made up for it, and the wealth of land on either side, sloping\nwith green meadows gently, and winding in and out with trees. Here were\ncattle, as red as chesnuts, running about with tails like spankers, such\nas I never saw before; but Ikey gave me to understand that the colour of\nthe earth was the cause of it, and that if I lived long upon corned beef\nmade of them (whose quality no other land could create), I should be\nturned to that hue myself. At this I laughed, as a sailor\'s yarn; but\nafter regarding him steadfastly, and then gazing again at the bullocks,\nI thought there might be some truth in it.\n\nOne thing I will say of these sons of Devon: rough they may be, and\nshort of grain, and fond of their own opinions, and not well up in\npoints of law--which is our very nature--queer, moreover, in thought and\nword, and obstinate as hedgehogs,--yet they show, and truly have, a kind\ndesire to feed one well. Money they have no great love of spending round\nthe corner, neither will they go surety freely for any man who is free\nto run; but ""vittels,"" as they call them, ""vittels!""--before you have\nbeen in a house two minutes out come these, and eat you must! Happily,\nupon this point I was able to afford them large and increasing\nsatisfaction, having rarely enjoyed so fine a means of pleasing myself\nand others also. For the things are good, and the people too; and it\ntakes a bad man to gainsay either.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA FINE SPECTACLE.\n\n\nWe brought the Rose of Devon to her moorings on the south side of the\nriver, about two miles short of Barnstaple, where a little bend and\ncreek is, and a place for barges, and ""Deadman\'s Pill"" was the name of\nit. What could a dead man want with a pill, was the very first thing I\nasked them; but they said that was no concern of theirs; there were\npills up and down the river for miles, as well as a town called\nPill-town. The cleverest man that I came across said that it must be by\nreason of piles driven in where the corners were to prevent the washing,\nand he showed me some piles, or their stumps, to prove it, and defied\nall further argument. For the time I was beaten, until of a sudden, and\ntoo late to let him know, I saw like a stupid that it must be no other\nthan our own word ""Pwll,"" which differs much from an English ""pool,""\nbecause it may be either dry or wet, so long as it lies in a hollow. And\nwith that I fell a-thinking of poor Bardie and Pwll Tavan. To be quit of\nremorse, and to see the world, I accepted old Ikey\'s invitation to\nBarnstaple fair for the very next day. We could not begin to discharge\nour limestone, as even that obstinate Fuzzy confessed, upon a sacred day\nlike that. Fuzzy himself had a mind for going, as we half suspected,\nalthough he held his tongue about it; and my under-mate told me to let\nhim alone, and see what would come of it.\n\nThe town is a pleasant and pretty one, and has always been famous for\nthinking itself more noble than any other; also the fair was a fine\nthing to see, full of people, and full of noise, and most outrageous\ndialect; everybody in fine broad humour, and no fighting worth even\nlooking at. This disappointed me; for in Wales we consider the off-day\nmarket a poor one, unless at least some of the women pull caps. I tried,\nhowever, not to miss it, having seen in foreign countries people meeting\npeaceably. Of this I could have had no intention to complain to poor\nIkey Hutchings. However, he took it as if I had, and offered to find me\na man from Bratton, or himself, to have a square with me, and stake\nhalf-a-crown upon it. He must have found early cause for repentance, if\nI had taken him at his word; but every one would have cried shame upon\nme against such a poor little fellow. And so we pushed on, and the\npeople pushed us.\n\nAfter a little more of this, and Ikey bragging all the time, though I\nsaw nothing very wonderful, we turned the corner of a narrow street, and\nopened into a broader one. Here there seemed to be no bullocks, such as\nhad made us keep springs on our cables, but a very amazing lot of\nhorses, trotting about, and parading, and rushing, most of them with\ntheir tails uphoisted, as if by discharging tackle. Among them stood\nmen, making much of their virtues, and sinking their faults (if they had\nany), and cracking a whip every now and then, with a style of applause\ntoward them.\n\nNow I have a natural love of the horse, though I never served long on\nboard of one; and I regularly feel, at sight of them, a desire to mount\nthe rigging. Many a time I have reasoned to my own conviction and my\nneighbours\', that a man who can stand on the mizzen-top-gallant yard in\na heavy gale of wind, must find it a ridiculously easy thing to hold on\nby a horse with the tackle to help him, and very likely a dead calm all\nround. Nevertheless, somehow or other, the result seems always\notherwise.\n\nI had just hailed a man with a colt to show off, and commodore\'s\npendants all over his tail, and was keeping clear of his counter to\ncatch the rise of the wave for boarding him, when a hush came over all\nhands as if the street had been raked with chain-shot. And on both sides\nof the street all people fell back and backed their horses, so that all\nthe roadway stood as clear as if the fair had turned into a Sunday\nmorning.\n\nUp the centre, and heeding the people no more than they would two rows\nof trees, came two grave gentlemen, daintily walking arm in arm, and\ndressed in black. They had broad-flapped hats, long coats of broadcloth,\nblack silk tunics, and buckled breeches, and black polished boots\nreaching up to the buckles.\n\nMeanwhile all the people stood huddled together upon the pitched stones\non either side, touching their hats, and scarce whispering, and even the\nshowing off of the horses went into the side-streets.\n\nAfter all the bowing and legging that I had beheld in the Royal Navy,\nthe double file, the noble salutes, the manning of the sides and yards,\nthe drums, the oars all upon the catch, and all the other glorious\nthings that fit us to thrash the Frenchmen so, there was nothing else\nleft for me to suppose but that here were two mighty admirals, gone into\nmourning very likely for the loss of the Royal George, or come on the\nsly perhaps to enjoy the rollicking of the fair, and sinking the uniform\nfor variety. How could I tell, and least of all would I think of\ninterfering with the pleasure of my betters; therefore I stopped in my\nthroat the cheer (which naturally seemed to rise the moment I took my\nhat off), for fear of letting the common people know that I understood\ntheir Honours. But after looking again so long as one might without\nbeing inquisitive, I saw that neither of these great men could walk the\ndeck in a rolling sea.\n\nI had been so bold in the thick of the horses, that Ikey had found it\ntoo much for him always to keep close to me; but now, as the nearest\nhorse must have drifted the length of two jolly-boats away, this little\nsailor came up and spoke.\n\n""Can \'e show the laikes of they two, in Taffy-land, old Taffy now?""\n\n""Plenty, I should hope,"" said I (though proud in the end to say ""not\none""); ""but what a fuss you make! Who are they?""\n\n""As if thee didn\'t know!"" cried Ikey, staring with indignation at me.\n\n""How should I know when I never clapped eyes on either of them till this\nmoment?""\n\n""Thou hast crossed the water for something then, Davy. Them be the two\nPassons!""\n\n""Two Passons!"" I could not say it exactly as he sounded it. ""I never\nheard of two Passons.""\n\n""\'A wants to draive me mad, \'a dooth,"" said Ikey, in self-commune: ""Did\n\'e never hear tell of Passon Chowne, and Passon Jack, man alive now?""\n\nIt was hopeless to try any more with him, for I could not ding into his\nstupid head the possibility of such ignorance. He could only believe\nthat I feigned it for the purpose of driving him out of his senses, or\nmaking little of his native land. So I felt that the best thing I could\ndo was to look at those two great gentlemen accurately and impartially,\nand thus form my own opinion. Hence there was prospect of further\npleasure, in coming to know more about them.\n\nVerily they were goodly men, so far as the outer frame goes; the one for\nsize, and strength, and stature--and the other for face, form, and\nquickness. I felt as surely as men do feel, who have dealed much among\nother men, that I was gazing upon two faces not of the common order. And\nthey walked as if they knew themselves to be ever so far from the\naverage. Not so much with pride, or conceit, or any sort of arrogance,\nbut with a manner of going distinct from the going of fellow-creatures.\nWhether this may have been so, because they were both going straight to\nthe devil, is a question that never crossed my mind, until I knew more\nabout them. For our parsons in Wales, take them all in all, can hardly\nbe called gentlemen; except, of course, our own, who was Colonel\nLougher\'s brother, also the one at Merthyr Mawr, and St Brides, and one\nor two other places where they were customers of mine; but most of the\nrest were small farmers\' sons, or shopkeepers\' boys, and so on. These\nmay do very well for a parish, or even a congregation that never sees a\ngentleman (except when they are summoned--and not always then); however,\nthis sort will not do for a man who has served, ay, and been in battle,\nunder two baronets and an earl.\n\nTherefore I looked with some misgiving at these two great parsons; but\nit did not take mo long to perceive that each of them was of good birth\nat least, whatever his manners afterwards,--men who must feel themselves\nout of their rank when buttoned into a pulpit for reasoning with\nDevonshire plough-tail Bobs, if indeed they ever did so; and as for\ntheir flocks, they kept dogs enough at any rate to look after them. For\nthey both kept hounds; and both served their Churches in true hunting\nfashion--that is to say, with a steeplechase, taking true country at\nfull gallop over hedges and ditches, and stabling the horse in the\nvestry. All this I did not know as yet, or I must have thought even\nmore than I did concerning those two gentlemen. The taller of the two\nwas as fair and ruddy, and as free of countenance as a June rose in the\nsunshine; a man of commanding build and figure, but with no other\ncommand about him, and least of all, that of his own self. The other it\nwas that took my gaze, and held it, having caught mine eyes, until I\nforgot myself, and dropped them under some superior strength. For the\ntime, I knew not how I felt, or what it was that vanquished me; only\nthat my spirit owned this man\'s to be its master. Whether from excess of\ngoodness, or from depth of desperate evil, at the time I knew not.\n\nIt was the most wondrous unfathomable face that ever fellow-man fixed\ngaze upon; lost to mankindliness, lost to mercy, lost to all memory of\nGod. As handsome a face as need be seen, with a very strong forehead and\ncoal-black eyes, a straight white nose, and a sharp-cut mouth, and the\nchin like a marble sculpture. Disdain was the first thing it gave one to\nthink of; and after that, cold relentless humour; and after that,\nanything dark and bad.\n\nMeanwhile this was a very handsome man, as women reckon beauty; and his\nage not over forty, perhaps; also of good average stature, active and\nelegant form, and so on. Neither years nor cubits make much odds to a\nman of that sort; and the ladies pronounce him perfect.\n\nWhen these two were gone by, I was able to gaze again at the taller one.\nTruly a goodly man he was, though spared from being a good one. He\nseemed to stand over me, like Sir Philip; although I was measured for\nsix feet and one inch, before I got into rheumatic ways. And as for size\nand compass, my parents never could give me food to fetch out my girth,\nas this parson\'s was. He looked a good yard and a half round the chest,\nand his arms were like oak-saplings. However, he proved to be a man void\nof some pride and some evil desires, unless anybody bore hard on him;\nand as for reading the collects, or lessons, or even the burial service,\nI was told that no man in the British realm was fit to say ""Amen"" to\nhim. This had something to do with the size of his chest, and perhaps\nmight have helped to increase it. His sermons also were done in a style\nthat women would come many miles to enjoy; beginning very soft and\nsweet, so as to melt the milder ones; and then of a sudden roaring\ngreatly with all the contents of enormous lungs, so as to ring all round\nthe sides of the strongest weaker vessels. And as for the men, what\ncould they think, when the preacher could drub any six of them?\n\nThis was ""Parson Jack,"" if you please, his surname being ""Rambone,"" as I\nneed not say, unless I write for unborn generations. His business in\nBoutport Street that day was to see if any man would challenge him. He\nhad held the belt seven years, they said, for wrestling, as well as for\nbruising; the condition whereof was to walk the street both at\nBarnstaple fair and at Bodmin revels, and watch whether any man laid\nfoot across him.\n\nThis he did purely as a layman might. But the boxing and bruising were\npart of his office, so that he hung up his cassock always for a\nchallenge to make rent in it. There had been some talk of a Cornishman\ninterfering about the wrestling; and bad people hoped that he might so\nattempt, and never know the way home again; but as for the fighting, the\ncassock might hang till the beard of Parson Jack was grey, before any\none made a hole in it. Also the Cornish wrestler found, after looking at\nParson Jack, that the wisest plan before him was to challenge the other\nCornishmen, and leave the belt in Devonshire.\n\nAll this I found out at a little gathering which was held round the\ncorner, in Bear Street, to reflect upon the business done at the fair,\nand compare opinions. And although I had never beheld till then any of\nour good company, neither expected to see them again, there were no two\nopinions about my being the most agreeable man in the room. I showed\nthem how to make punch to begin with, as had been done by his Royal\nHighness, with me to declare proportions; and as many of the farmers had\nturned some money, they bade me think twice about no ingredient that\nwould figure on the bill, even half-a-crown.\n\nBy right of superior knowledge, and also as principal guest of the\nevening, I became voted the chairman, upon the clear understanding that\nI would do them the honour of paying nothing; and therein I found not a\nman that would think of evading his duty towards the chair. I entreated\nthem all to be frank, and regard me as if I were born in Barnstaple,\nwhich they might look upon as being done otherwise, as the mere turn of\na shaving; for my father had been there twice, and my mother more than\nonce thought of trying it. Everybody saw the force of this; and after a\nvery fine supper we grew as genial as could be. And leading them all\nwith a delicate knowledge of the ins and outs of these natives (many of\nwhich I had learned at the fair), and especially by encouraging their\nbent for contradiction, I heard a good deal of the leading people in the\ntown or out of it. I listened, of course, to a very great deal, which\nmight be of use to me or might not; but my object was, when I could\ngather in their many-elbowed stories, to be thoroughly up to the mark on\nthree points.\n\nFirst, about Fuzzy, and most important. Who was he? What was he? Where\ndid he live? Had he got a wife? And if so, why? And if not, more\nespecially, why again? Also, how much money had he, and what in the\nworld did he do with it; and could he have, under the rose, any reason\nfor keeping our women so distant? Particularly, I had orders to know\nwhether he was considered handsome by the Devonshire women. For our\nwomen could not make up their minds, and feared to give way to the high\nopinion engendered by his contempt of them. Only they liked his general\nhairiness, if it could be warranted not to come off.\n\nUpon this point I learned nothing at all. No man even knew Bethel Jose,\nor, at any rate, none would own to it, perhaps because Ikey was there to\nhearken; so I left that until I should get with the women. My next\nmatter was about Braunton Burrows, and the gentleman of high rank who\nwandered up and down without telling us why. And I might hereupon have\nwon some knowledge, and was beginning to do so, when a square stout man\ncame in and said ""Hush!"" and I would gladly have thrown a jug at him.\nNevertheless, I did learn something which I mean to tell next to\ndirectly.\n\nBut as concerned the third question before me (and to myself the most\nitching of any), satisfaction, to at least half-measure, was by proper\nskill and fortune brought within my reach almost. And this I must set\ndown at leisure, soberly thinking over it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT HIM.\n\n\nIt was of course not Parson Rambone but the Parson Chowne who aroused my\ndesire of knowledge so strongly. And even here I was met at first by\nfailure and disappointment. The men would only shake their hands and\nsay ""Ah, he is a queer one!"" or, ""Well, well, we can\'t expect all folk\nto be alike, you know;"" or even some of the ruder spirits, ""You had\nbetter go yourself and ask him""--a most absurd suggestion, for never yet\nhad I seen a man less fit to encourage impertinence. Far more ready\nwould I have been to displease even his great comrade, the Reverend John\nRambone; and no one who saw them together could doubt which of the two\nwas the master. My true course was clearly to bide my time, and, as\nchairman, to enhance the goodwill and geniality of the evening. And this\nI was ready enough to do--ay, and in the vein for it--bearing in mind\nthe wisdom of enjoying to the utmost such favourable circumstances, to\nbe on the free boot, and well received in a place entirely new to me,\nwhere I found myself so much ahead of everybody in matter of mind, and\nsome of them glad to acknowledge it; also where no customer could be\nwaiting to reproach me, nor even a justice of the peace well versed in\nmy countenance; moreover, blessed as I was with a sense of pity for\nthese natives, and a largeness of goodwill to them, such a chance had\nnever crossed me since the day my wife did.\n\nIkey and I had a good laugh also at that surly Bethel Jose, who had\nshown himself so much above the fair in mind, yet was there in body.\nNone but Bang, the boy, had been left for captain and crew of the Rose\nof Devon, and before it was dark we had found Bang shooting, at four\nshots a-penny, for cocoa-nut slices, with ginger-beer poured over them.\n\nNow fortune stood my friend that night, for before we began to find\nourselves in a condition at all uproarious, I managed to loosen the\ntongues of these natives by means of some excellent stories. Recalling\nthe fame of my grandfather (that long David Llewellyn, who made on his\nharp three unconquered ballads, and won the first prize at all the\nEisteddfods held during his life for Englynion), I could not accept it\nas my business to play second fiddle. Therefore, being in a happy mood,\nI was enabled to recount such stories as made these Devonshire folk open\ntheir mouths like a man at a great rock-oyster, while their experience\nwas in contention with faith and perhaps good manners. And as their\nnature is obstinate and most unwilling to be outdone, they found\nthemselves driven down at last to tell the most wonderful things they\nknew, or else to be almost nobodies. And putting aside what their\ngrandfathers might have seen or heard or even done--which is a mistake\nto dwell upon--all their stories worth curve of the ear were of Parson\nChowne, and no other.\n\nFor this man was a man, as we say. No other man must have a will that\nstood across the path of his. If he heard of any one unwilling to give\nway to him, he would not go to bed until he had taken that arrogance out\nof him. Many people, and even some of ten times his own fortune, had\ndone their best, one after the other, not to be beaten by him. All of\nthem found that they could not do it, and that their only chance of\ncomfort was to knock under to Parson Chowne. And even after that had\nbeen done, he was not always satisfied, but let them know from time to\ntime their folly in offending him. And most of all, he made a point (as\nwas natural perhaps) of keeping the Lord Bishop of the country under\nhim. Some of these had done their best (before they understood him) to\nmake his habits hold themselves within some stretch of discipline; or,\nif that could not be hoped, at any rate to keep silent. When he heard of\nthese ideas he was not a little pleased, because he descried a rare\nchance of sport, and he followed it up with their lordships. The law he\nknew to its lowest tittle, and while he broke it every day himself, woe\nto any man who dared to break it against him. And gradually these\nbishops came (one after the other growing a little alive to what the\nparsons were) not so much to let him alone as to desire his\nacquaintance--out of school, if so I may put it, in my ignorance of the\nbench of bishops. For well as I know a fish called ""the Pope,"" and also\na pear said to be ""Bishop\'s thumb,"" not to mention a grass called\n""Timothy,"" it has not been my luck thus far to rise above the bench of\nmagistrates.\n\n""Let be"" is the wisest thing one can say; and so everybody said of him,\nso soon as ever it was acknowledged that he could never be put down. And\nthus he might have done well enough if he would have been content with\nthis. Only it never was his nature to be content with anything, which is\nthe only true way to get on; if any one cares for that sort of thing,\nwho knows mankind\'s great randomness. Because the one who shoves and\nswears without being too particular, has the best chance to hoist\nhimself upon the backs of the humble. By dint of this, and to keep him\nquiet, Parson Chowne himself, they said, might have been bishop if so he\nhad chosen. For this he had some fine qualifications, for his very\nchoicest pleasure was found in tormenting his fellow-parsons: and a man\nof so bold a mind he was, that he believed in nothing except himself.\n\nEven his own servants never knew how to come nigh him. One at the\nstables would touch his hat, and he would kick him for reply; then\nanother would come without ceremony, and he knocked him down to learn\nit. Also in the house, the maidens had the same account to give. However\nmuch they might think of themselves, and adorn themselves to that\nestimate, he never was known to do so much as to chuck any one of them\nunder the chin, as they had been at all other places much in the habit\nof feeling; neither did he make a joke to excuse himself for omitting\nit. As to that, they would scorn themselves ever to think of permitting\nit, being young women of high respect, and quite aware how to conduct\nthemselves. But they might have liked to stop him, and they got no\nchance of doing it.\n\nAll this small-talk almost vexed me more than the content it gave. Every\nnow and then I could see the man in these little corner views, but they\ndid not show me round him so as to get his girth and substance. ""Think\nof the devil,"" is an old saying; and while I thought of him, in he\nwalked.\n\nAt the very first glimpse of him, all those people who had been talking\nso freely about him shrank away, and said, ""Servant, sir!"" and looked so\nfoolish more than usual, that he read them with one eye. He had his\nriding-clothes on now, and it made him look still sharper.\n\n""Talking of me, good people, eh? I hope the subject pleases you. Open\nyour ranks, if you please, and show me whether my groom is behind you.""\nHe cracked a great hunting-whip as he spoke, and it seemed a poor\nprospect for the groom, wherever he might be loitering.\n\n""Plaize your honour, your honour\'s groom have not been here all day\na\'most; and if her coom\'th, us \'ont keep un.""\n\n""In that resolution you are wise. What! you here, Welshman? I marked you\nto-day. You will come to me by noon to-morrow. Here is for your\ncharges.""\n\nHe threw on the table two crown-pieces, and was gone before I knew what\nanswer I was bound to make to him. The men, recovering from his\npresence, ran to the window to watch him as far as the flaring lights of\nthe fair, now spluttering low, displayed him. Without being able to see\nso much as I strongly desired to see of him, I could not help admiring\nnow his look, and his manner, and strong steady gait, and the general\nstyle of his outward man. His free way of going along made clear the\nexcellence of his clothing; and he swung his right elbow, as I was told,\nfrom his constant desire to lash a horse. He was the devil himself to\nride, so everybody said of him; and Parson Chowne\'s horse was now become\na by-word for any one thoroughly thrashed. And yet no other man must\never dare to touch his horses. If any one did, no deadlier outrage could\nbe put upon him.\n\nHearing these things from fourteen customers able to express their\nthoughts, I was sorry when the corner turned upon Parson Chowne, so\nwalking in the light of long deal tables, set with finely-guttering\ncandles, and with goods not quite sold out. And he left upon my memory a\nvision of a great commander, having a hat of controlling movements, and\na riding-coat so shaped that a horse appeared to be under it; and lower\ndown, buff leathern breeches, and boots well over the hinge of his legs,\nand silver heels, and silver spurs, and nothing to obscure him. No\ntopcoat or outer style of means to fend the weather, because he could\nkeep it in order always.\n\n""I wish I was like him, then,"" said I; ""and what does he mean by\ninsulting me? I know a hundred bigger fellows. Am I at his beck and\ncall?""\n\n""I warr\'n thou wilt be, zoon enough,"" answered, with a heavy grin, a\nlout of a fellow, who had shown no more sense than to leave the room at\nthe very crash and crown of one of my best stories; ""hast heered what\nPasson have now a dooed?"" He was come in primed with some rubbishing\ntale, and wanted the room to make much of him. Nevertheless, the men of\nperception had not done with me yet.\n\n""Wuttever be un? wuttever be un? Spak up, Oasler Jan!"" cried some of the\naltogether younger men, who never know good work from bad, but seek some\nnew astonishment. Goodness knows how hard it was, and how wholly\nundeserved, for me to withdraw and let them talk, only because their\nnews was newer, and about a favourite man to talk of. However, I pressed\ndown my feelings, not being certain about my bill, if I offended any\none. For mercy\'s sake I spare their brogue, and tell their story\ndecently. And Ostler John\'s tale was as follows, so far as I could make\nit out, by means of good luck, and by watching his face.\n\nA certain justice of the peace, whose name was Captain Vellacott, a\ngentleman of spirit, who lived in one of the parishes belonging to this\nParson Chowne (who happened to have two churches), this gentleman had\ncontrived to give, as almost every one managed to do, deadly offence to\nParson Chowne. It was expected that the Parson would be content to have\nhim down and horsewhip him (as his manner was), and burn his house down\nafterwards. But the people who thought this were too hasty, and\nunderstood not his reverence. Whether from dislike of sitting upon the\nbench with him afterwards, or whether because Mrs Vellacott also had\ndared to shake hands with her gauntlet on, or because the baby cried\nwhen offered up to kiss the Parson--at any rate, Captain Vellacott must\nhave more than a simple chastisement. The Captain being a quick sharp\nman, who said a hot word and forgot it, laughed at every one who told\nhim to see to himself; and so on. ""The Parson,"" said he, ""is a man of\nhis cloth; so am I of mine; and I will not insult him by expecting\ninsult."" So it came to pass that he made the mistake of measuring\nanother man by his own measure. After a few months this gentleman felt\nthat the Parson had quite forgiven him, no evil having befallen him yet,\nexcept that his rick-yard had twice been fired, and his wife insulted by\nthe naked people whom Chowne maintained upon Nympton Moor. And so, when\nthey met in the fair this day, the Captain bowed to the Parson, and\nmeant to go on and see to his business. But the other would not have it\nso. He offered his hand most cordially, and asked how Mrs Vellacott was,\nand all the five children, according to ages, using the Christian name\nof each. Captain Vellacott was so pleased by the kindness of his memory,\nand the nobility shown in dropping whatever had been between them, that\nwhat did he do but invite Master Chowne to dine with him up at the\nFortescue Arms Hotel, and see a young horse he had bought in the fair,\ngiving his own for it and five guineas; for he was not a rich man at\nall, and was come to make a moderate bargain.\n\nEverything might have gone on well, and perhaps the Parson really meant\nto forgive him at the moment for having dared, in the bygone matter, to\nhave a will of his own almost. But, as bad luck would have it, this very\nhorse that the Captain had bought turned out to be one which the Parson\nhad eye upon ever since last year\'s hunting season. However, not to\npaint the devil too black, it was confessed that he offered Vellacott\nfive pounds for his bargain. This ought to have satisfied any man who\nknew what Parson Chowne was, and that fifty times five pounds would be\nsaved by keeping out of his black books. Nevertheless the Captain stuck\nto his bargain and ruined himself.\n\nThe two gentlemen parted very good friends, shaking hands warmly, and\nhaving their joke, and hoping to dine again soon together; for Parson\nChowne could beat all the world at after-dinner stories; and the Captain\nwas the best man to laugh anywhere round the neighbourhood. And so he\nstarted rather early, on purpose to show his new horse to his wife.\n\nBut the ostler, who was a very old codger, and had seen a little of\nParson\'s ways, shook his head after the Captain\'s shilling, and spat\nupon it to prevent bad luck, and laid it on the shelf where he kept his\nblacking. He was too clever to say one word; but every one remembered\nhow he had behaved, and the sigh he gave--when he reminded them.\n\nIt may have been half an hour afterwards, or it may have been an hour\nand a half (so much these people differed), when Captain Vellacott on a\nhurdle came to Surgeon Cutcliffe\'s door, and the horse was led to\nFarrier Gould, who sent him to the mayor for opinions, and his worship\nsent him on to Pilch of the knacker\'s yard. Poor Justice Vellacott\'s\ncollar bone was snapped in two places, and his left thigh broken, also\nthree of his ribs stoven in, and a good deal of breakage abroad in his\nhead. However, they hoped that he might come round; and being a\nDevonshire man, he did, as I found out afterwards.\n\nThis tale, which Ostler John delivered at ten times the length of the\nabove, caused a very great stir and excitement and comparison of\nopinions. And when these wiseacres had almost exhausted their powers of\nwonder, I desired to know, in the name of goodness, why the poor Parson\nmust be saddled with every man who fell off his horse. In the first\nplace, he must have been far away from the scene of the misfortune,\ninasmuch as no more than an hour ago he was seeking his groom amongst\nus. And, again, what could be more likely than that Captain Vellacott\nmight have taken, with a view to good luck for his purchase, a bottle or\ntwo of wine beyond what otherwise would have contented him? And even if\nnot--why, a horse might fall, much more a man (who has only two legs),\nwithout anybody having designed it.\n\nThis reasoning of mine made no impression, because everybody\'s opinion\nwas set. ""Passon Chowne had adooed it;"" they scratched their heads and\nwent into side questions, but on the main point all agreed--""\'twor\nayther the Passon or the devil himzell.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nA VISIT TO A PARSON.\n\n\nMy opinion of Devonshire now grew fast that most of the people are mad\nthere. Honest, respectable, very kind-hearted, shrewd at a bargain, yet\ntrustful, simple, manly, and outspoken, nevertheless they must be mad to\nkeep Parson Chowne among them. But here, as in one or two other matters,\nI found myself wrong ere I finished with it. If a man visits a strange\ncountry, he ought to take time to think about it, and not judge the\nnatives by first appearance, however superior he may be. This I felt\neven then, and tried my very best to act up to it: nevertheless it came\nback on me always that in the large county of Devon there were only two\nsound people; Parson Chowne for the one--and, of course, for the other,\nDavy Llewellyn.\n\nSo I resolved to see this thing out, especially as (when I came to\nthink) nothing could be clearer than that the Parson himself had\ndescried and taken me (with his wonderful quickness) for the only\nintelligent man to be found. How he knew me to be a Welshman, I could\nnot tell then, and am not sure now. It must have been because I looked\nso superior to the rest of them. I gazed at the two crown-pieces, when I\ncame to be active again the next day; and finding them both very good, I\ndetermined to keep them, and go to see after some more. But if I thought\nto have got the right side of the bargain, so far as the money went, I\nreckoned amiss considerably; for I found that the Parson lived so far\naway, that I could not walk thither and back again without being\nfootsore for a week; and Captain Fuzzy would not allow it, especially as\nhe had bound me to help in discharging cargo. And being quite ignorant\nas to the road, to hire a horse would not avail me, even supposing I\ncould stay on board of him, which was against all experience. And by the\ntime I had hired a cart to take me to Nympton on the Moors, as well as a\nhand to pilot her, behold I was on the wrong side of my two crowns,\nwithout any allowance for rations. They told me that everybody always\ncharged double price for going up to the Parson\'s, and even so did not\ncare for the job much. Because, though it was possible to come back\nsafe, there was a poor chance of doing so without some damage to man or\nbeast, and perhaps to the vehicle also.\n\nHereupon I had a great mind not to go; but being assured upon all sides\nthat this would be a most dangerous thing, as well as supported,\nperhaps, by my native resolution and habits of inquiry, I nailed my\ncolours to the mast, and mounted the cart by the larboard slings. It was\na long and tiresome journey, quite up into a wilderness; and, for the\nlatter part of it, the track could not have been found, except by means\nof a rough stone flung down here and there. But the driver told me that\nParson Chowne took the whole of it three times a-week at a gallop, not\nbeing able to live without more harm than this lonely place afforded.\nFinding this fellow more ahead of his wits than most of those Devonshire\nyokels are, I beguiled the long journey by letting him talk, and now and\nthen putting a question to him. He was full, of course, like all the\ntown, of poor Captain Vellacott\'s misadventure, and the terrible spell\nput upon his new horse, which had seemed in the morning so quiet and\ndocile. This he pretended at first to explain as the result of a compact\nformed some years back between his reverence and the devil. For Parson\nChowne had thoroughly startled and robbed the latter of all self-esteem,\nuntil he had given in, and contracted to be at his beck and call (like a\ngood servant) until it should come to the settlement. And poor Parson\nJack was to be thrown in, though not such a very bad man sometimes; it\nbeing thoroughly understood, though not expressed between them, that\nParson Chowne was to lead him on, step by step, with his own pilgrimage.\n\nAll this I listened to very quietly, scarce knowing what to say about\nit. However, I asked the driver, as a man having intimate knowledge of\nhorses, whether he really did believe that they (like the swine of the\nGadarenes) were laid open to infection from even a man with seven devils\nin him; and the more so as these had been never cast out, according to\nall that appeared of him. At this he cracked his whip and thought, not\nbeing much at theology; and not having met, it may be, until now, a man\nso thoroughly versed in it. I gave him his time to consider it out; but\nthe trouble seemed only to grow on him, until he laid down his whip and\nsaid, not being able to do any more, ""Horses is horses, and pigs is\npigs, every bit the same as men be men. If the Lord made \'em both, the\ndevil had the right to take \'em both.""\n\nThis was so sound in point of reasoning, as well as of what we do hear\nin church, that never another word could I say, being taken in my own\nshallowness. And this is the only thing that can happen to a fellow too\nfond of objections. However, the driver, perceiving now that he had been\ntoo much for me, was pleased with me, and became disposed to make it up\nby a freedom of further information. If I were to put this in his own\nwords, who could make head or tail of it? And indeed I could not stoop\nmy pen to write such outlandish language. He said that his cousin was\nthe very same knacker who had slaughtered that poor horse last night, to\nput it out of misery. Having an order from the mayor, ""Putt thiss here\nhannimall to deth,"" he did it, and thought no more about it, until he\ngot up in the morning. Then, as no boiling was yet on hand, he went to\nlook at this fine young horse, whose time had been so hastened. And the\nbrains being always so valuable for mixing with fresh--but I will not\ntell for the sake of honour--it was natural that he should look at the\nhead of this poor creature. Finding the eyes in a strange condition, he\nexamined them carefully, and, lifting the lids and probing round, in\neach he found a berry. My coachman said that his cousin now took these\ntwo berries which he had thus discovered out of a new horn-box, in which\nhe had placed them for certainty, and asked him to make out what they\nwere. The knacker, for his part, believed that they came from a creeping\nplant called the ""Bitter-sweet nightshade,"" or sometimes the ""Lady\'s\nnecklace."" But his cousin, my coachman, thought otherwise. He had\nwandered a good deal about in the fields before he married his young\nwoman; and there he had seen, in autumnal days, the very same things as\nhad killed the poor horse. A red thing that sticks in a cloven pod, much\nharder than berries of nightshade, and likely to keep in its poison\nuntil the moisture and warmth should dissolve its skin. I knew what he\nmeant after thinking a while, because when a child I had gathered them.\nIt is the seed of a nasty flag, which some call the ""Roast-beef plant,""\nand others the ""Stinking Iris."" These poisonous things in the eyes of a\nhorse, cleverly pushed in under the lids, heating and melting, according\nas the heating and working of muscles crushed them; then shooting their\nred fire over the agonised tissues of eyeballs,--what horse would not\nhave gone mad with it?\n\nAlso finding so rare a chance of a Devonshire man who was not dumb, I\ntook opportunity of going into the matter of that fine old gentleman,\nwhose strange and unreasonable habit of seeking among those Braunton\nBurrows (as if for somebody buried there) had almost broken my rest ever\nsince, till I stumbled on yet greater wonders. Coachman, however, knew\nnothing about it, or else was not going to tell too much, and took a\nsudden turn of beginning to think that I asked too many questions,\nwithout even an inn to stand treat at. And perhaps he found out, with\nthe jerks of the cart, that I had a very small phial of rum, not enough\nfor two people to think of.\n\nHe may have been bidding for that, with his news; if so, he made a great\nmistake. Not that I ever grudge anything; only that there was not half\nenough for myself under the trying circumstances, and the man should\nhave shown better manners than ever to cast even half an eye on it.\n\nAt last we were forced, on the brow of a hill, to come to a mooring in a\nfine old ditch, not having even a wall, or a tree, or a rick of peat to\nshelter us. And half a mile away round the corner might be found (as the\ndriver said) the rectory house of Parson Chowne. Neither horse nor man\nwould budge so much as a yard more in that direction, and it took a\ngreat deal to make them promise to wait there till two of the clock for\nme. But I had sense enough to pay nothing until they should carry me\nhome again. Still I could not feel quite sure how far their courage\nwould hold out in a lonely place, and so unkind.\n\nAnd even with all that I feel within me of royal blood from royal\nbards--which must be the highest form of it--I did not feel myself so\nwholly comfortable and relishing as my duty is towards dinner-time.\nNevertheless I plucked up courage, and went round the corner. Here I\nfound a sort of a road with fir-trees on each side of it, all blown one\nway by strong storms, and unable to get back again. The road lay not in\na hollow exactly, but in a shallow trough of the hills, which these\nfir-trees were meant to fill up, if the wind would allow them occasion.\nAnd going between them I felt the want of the pole I had left behind me.\nAnd if I had happened to own a gold watch, or anything fit to breed\nenemies, the knowledge of my price would have kept me from such\ntemptation of Providence.\n\nA tremendous roaring of dogs broke upon me the moment I got the first\nglimpse of the house; and this obliged me to go on carefully, because of\nthat race I have had too much, and never found them mannersome. One huge\nfellow rushed up to me, and disturbed my mind to so great a degree that\nI was unable to take heed of anything about the place except his savage\neyes and highly alarming expression and manner. For he kept on showing\nhis horrible tusks, and growling a deep growl broken with snarls, and\nsidling to and fro, so as to get the better chance of a dash at me; and\nI durst not take my eyes from his, or his fangs would have been in my\nthroat at a spring. I called him every endearing name that I could lay\nmy tongue to, and lavished upon him such admiration as might have melted\nthe sternest heart; but he placed no faith in a word of it, and nothing\nexcept my determined gaze kept him at bay for a moment. Therefore I felt\nfor my sailor\'s knife, which luckily hung by a string from my belt; and\nif he had leaped at me he would have had it, as sure as my name is\nLlewellyn; and few men, I think, would find fault with me for doing my\nbest to defend myself. However, one man did, for a stern voice cried--\n\n""Shut your knife, you scoundrel! Poor Sammy, did the villain threaten\nyou?""\n\nSammy crouched, and fawned, and whimpered, and went on his belly to lick\nhis master, while I wiped the perspiration of my fright beneath my hat.\n\n""This is a nice way to begin,"" said Chowne, after giving his dog a kick,\n""to come here and draw a knife on my very best dog. Go down on your\nknees, sir, and beg Sammy\'s pardon.""\n\n""May it please your reverence,"" I replied, in spite of his eyes, which\nlay fiercer upon me than even those of the dog had done, ""I would have\ncut his throat; and I will, if he dares to touch me.""\n\n""That would grieve me, my good Welshman, because I should then let loose\nthe pack, and we might have to bury you. However, no more of this\ntrifle. Go in to my housekeeper, and recover your nerves a little, and\nin half an hour come to my study.""\n\nI touched my hat and obeyed his order, following the track which he\npointed out, but keeping still ready for action if any more dogs should\nbear down on me. However, I met no creature worse than a very morose old\nwoman, who merely grunted in reply to the very best flourish I could\ncontrive, and led me into a long low kitchen. Dinner-time for the common\npeople being now at maturity, I expected to see all the servants of\ncourse, and to smell something decent and gratifying. However, there was\nno such luck, only, without even asking my taste, she gave me a small\njug of sour ale, and the bottom of a loaf, and a bit of Dutch cheese. Of\ncourse this was good enough for me; and having an appetite after the\nride, I felt truly grateful. However, I could not help feeling also that\nin the cupboard just over my elbow there lay a fillet of fine spiced\nbeef, to which I have always been partial. And after the perils I had\nencountered, the least she could do was to offer it down. Anywhere else\nI might have taken the liberty of suggesting this, but in that house I\ndurst not, further than to ask very delicately--\n\n""Madam, it is early for great people; but has his reverence been pleased\nto dine?""\n\n""Did he give you leave to ask, sir?""\n\n""No, I cannot say that he did. I meant no offence; but only----""\n\n""I mean no offence; but only, you must be a stranger to think of asking\na question in this house without his leave.""\n\nNothing could have been said to me more thoroughly grievous and\noppressive. And she offered no line or opening for me to begin again, as\ncross women generally do, by not being satisfied with their sting. So I\nmade the best of my bread-and-cheese, and thought that Sker House was a\nparadise compared to Nympton Rectory.\n\n""It is time for you now to go to my master,"" she broke in with her cold\nharsh voice, before I had scraped all the rind of my cheese, and when I\nwas looking for more sour beer.\n\n""Very well,"" I replied; ""there is no temptation of any sort, madam, to\nlinger here.""\n\nShe smiled, for the first time, a very tart smile, even worse than the\nflavour of that shrewd ale, but without its weakness. And then she\npointed up some steps, and along a stone passage, and said, exactly as\nif she took me for no more than a common tramp--\n\n""At the end of that passage turn to the left, and knock at the third\ndoor round the corner. You dare not lay hands on anything. My master\nwill know it if you do.""\n\nThis was a little too much for me, after all the insults I had now put\nup with. I turned and gazed full on her strange square face, and into\nthe depth of her narrow black eyes, with a glimpse of the window showing\nthem.\n\n""Your master!"" I said. ""Your son, you mean! And much there is to choose\nbetween you!""\n\nShe did not betray any signs of surprise at this hap-hazard shot of\nmine, but coldly answered my gaze, and said--\n\n""You are very insolent. Let me give you a warning. You seem to be a\npowerful man: in the hands of my master you would be a babe, although\nyou are so much larger. And were I to tell him what you have said, there\nwould not be a sound piece of skin on you. Now, let me hear no more of\nyou.""\n\n""With the greatest pleasure, madam. I am sure I can\'t understand\nwhatever could bring me here.""\n\n""But I can;"" she answered, more to her own thoughts than to mine, as she\nshut the door quite on my heels, and left me to my own devices. I felt\nalmost as much amiss as if I were in an evil dream of being chased\nthrough caves of rock by some of my very best customers, all bearing\nred-hot toasting forks, and pelting me with my own good fish. It is the\nvery worst dream I have, and it never comes after a common supper; which\nproves how clear my conscience is. And even now I might have escaped,\nbecause there were side passages; and for a minute I stood in doubt,\nuntil there came into my mind the tales of the pack of hounds he kept,\nand two or three people torn to pieces, and nobody daring to interfere.\nAlso, I wanted to see him again, for he beat everybody I had ever seen;\nand I longed to be able to describe him to a civilised audience at the\n""Jolly Sailors."" Therefore I knocked at the door of his room,\napproaching it very carefully, and thanking the Lord for His last great\nmercy in having put my knife into my head.\n\n""You may come in,"" was the answer I got at last; and so in I went; and a\nqueerer room I never did go into. But wonderful as the room was surely,\nand leaving on memory a shade of half-seen wonders afterwards, for the\ntime I had no power to look at anything but the man.\n\nPeople may laugh (and they always do until they gain experience) at the\nidea of one man binding other men prisoners to his will. For all their\nlaughing, there stands the truth; and the men who resist such influence\nbest are those who do not laugh at it. I have seen too much of the\ntricks of the world to believe in anything supernatural; but the\ngranting of this power is most strictly within nature\'s scope; and\nsomebody must have it. One man has the gift of love, that everybody\nloves him; another has the gift of hate, that nobody comes near him; the\nthird, and far the rarest gift, combines the two others (one more, one\nless), and adds to them both the gift of fear. I felt, as I tried to\nmeet his gaze and found my eyes quiver away from it, that the further I\nkept from this man\'s sight, the better it would be for me.\n\nHe sat in a high-backed chair, and pointed to a three-legged stool, as\nmuch as to say, ""You may even sit down."" This I did, and waited for him.\n\n""Your name is David Llewellyn,"" he said, caring no more to look at me;\n""you came from the coast of Glamorgan, three days ago, in the Rose of\nDevon schooner.""\n\n""Ketch, your reverence, if you please. The difference is in the\nmizzen-mast.""\n\n""Well, Jack Ketch, if you like, sir. No more interrupting me. Now you\nwill answer a few questions; and if you tell me one word of\nfalsehood----""\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but he frightened me far more than if he\nhad. I promised to do my best to tell the truth, so far as lies in me.\n\n""Do you know what child that was that came ashore drowned upon your\ncoast, when the coroner made such a fool of himself?""\n\n""And the jury as well, your reverence. About the child I know nothing at\nall.""\n\n""Describe that child to the best of your power: for you are not\naltogether a fool.""\n\nI told him what the poor babe was like, so far as I could remember it.\nBut something holy and harmless kept me from saying one word about\nBardie. And to the last day of my life I shall rejoice that I so\nbehaved. He saw that I was speaking truth; but he showed no signs of joy\nor sorrow, until I ventured to put in--\n\n""May I ask why your reverence wishes to know, and what you think of this\nmatter, and how----""\n\n""Certainly you may ask, Llewellyn; it is a woman\'s and a Welshman\'s\nprivilege; but certainly you shall have no reply. What inquiry has been\nmade along your coast about this affair?""\n\nI longed to answer him in my humour, even as he had answered me. With\nany one else I could have done it, but I durst not so with him.\nTherefore I told him all the truth, to the utmost of my\nknowledge,--making no secret of Hezekiah, and his low curiosity; also\nthe man of the press with the hat; and then I could not quite leave out\nthe visit of Anthony Stew and Sir Philip.\n\nThis more than anything else aroused Parson Chowne\'s attention. For the\npapers he cared not a damn, he said; for two of them lived by abusing\nhim; but as he swore not (except that once), it appeared to me that he\ndid care. However, he pressed me most close and hard about Anthony Stew\nand Sir Philip.\n\nWhen he had got from me all that I knew--except that he never once hit\nupon Bardie (the heart and the jewel of everything), he asked me without\nany warning--\n\n""Do you know who that Sir Philip is?""\n\n""No, your reverence; I have not even heard so much as his surname,\nalthough, no doubt, I shall find out.""\n\n""You fool! Is that all the wit you have? Three days in and out of\nBarnstaple! It is Sir Philip Bampfylde of Narnton Court, close by you.""\n\n""There is no Narnton Court, that I know of, your reverence, anywhere\nround our neighbourhood. There is Candleston Court, and Court Isa, and\nCourt----""\n\n""Tush, I mean near where your ship is lying. And that is chiefly what I\nwant with you. I know men well; and I know that you are a man that will\ndo anything for money.""\n\nMy breath was taken away at this: so far was it from my true character.\nI like money well enough in its way; but as for a single disgraceful\naction----\n\n""Your reverence never made such a mistake. For coming up here I have\neven paid more than you were pleased to give me. If that is your point I\nwill go straight back. Do anything, indeed, for money!""\n\n""Pooh! This is excellent indignation. What man is there but will do so?\nI mean, of course, anything you consider to be right and virtuous.""\n\n""Anything which is undeniably right, and upright, and virtuous. Ah! now\nyour reverence understands me. Such has always been my character.""\n\n""In your own opinion. Well, self-respect is a real blessing: I will not\nask you to forego it. Your business will be of a nature congenial as\nwell as interesting to you. Your ship lies just in the right position\nfor the service I require; and as she is known to have come from Wales,\nno Revenue-men will trouble you. You will have to keep watch, both day\nand night, upon Sir Philip and Narnton Court.""\n\n""Nothing in the nature of spying, your reverence, or sneaking after\nservants, or underhand work----""\n\n""Nothing at all of that sort. You have nothing to do but to use your\neyes upon the river-front of the building, especially the landing-place.\nYou will come and tell me as soon as ever you see any kind of boat or\nvessel either come to or leave the landing-place. Also, if any man with\na trumpet hails either boat or vessel. In short, any kind of\ncommunication betwixt Narnton Court and the river. You need not take\nany trouble, except when the tide is up the river.""\n\n""Am I to do this against Sir Philip, who has been so kind and good to\nme? If so, I will hear no more of it.""\n\n""Not so; it is for Sir Philip\'s good. He is in danger, and very\nobstinate. He stupidly meddles with politics. My object is to save him.""\n\n""I see what your reverence means,"" I answered, being greatly relieved by\nthis; for then (and even to this day, I believe) many of the ancient\nfamilies were not content with his gracious Majesty, but hankered after\nungracious Stuarts, mainly because they could not get them. ""I will do\nmy best to oblige you, sir."" I finished, and made a bow to him.\n\n""To obey me, you mean. Of course you will. But remember one thing--you\nare not to dare to ask a single word about this family, or even mention\nSir Philip\'s name to anybody except myself. I have good reason for this\norder. If you break it I shall know it, and turn you to stone\nimmediately. You are aware that I possess that power.""\n\n""Please your reverence, I have heard so; and I would gladly see it\ndone--not to myself as yet, but rather to that old woman in the kitchen.\nIt could not make much difference to her.""\n\n""Keep your position, sir,"" he answered, in a tone which frightened me;\nit was not violent, but so deep. ""And now for your scale of wages. Of\ncourse, being opposite that old house, you would watch it without any\norders. The only trouble I give you is this--when the tide runs up after\ndark, and smooth water lets vessels over the bar, you will have to\nloosen your boat or dingy, punt, or whatever you call her, and pull\nacross the river, and lie in a shaded corner which you will find below\nNarnton Court, and commanding a view of it. Have you firearms? Then take\nthis. The stock is hollow, and contains six charges. You can shoot; I am\nsure of that. I know a poacher by his eyelids.""\n\nHe gave me a heavy two-barrelled pistol, long enough for a gun almost,\nand meant to be fired from the shoulder. Then pressing a spring in the\nstock, he laid bare a chamber containing some ammunition, as well as a\ncouple of spare flints. He was going to teach me how to load it, till I\ntold him that I had been captain of cannon, and perhaps the best shot in\nthe royal navy.\n\n""Then don\'t shoot yourself,"" he said, ""as most of the old sailors have\nreason to do. But now you will earn your living well, what with your\nwages on board the schooner and the crown a-week I shall give you.""\n\n""A crown a-week, your reverence!"" My countenance must have fallen sadly;\nfor I looked to a guinea a-week at least. ""And to have to stay out of my\nbed like that!""\n\n""It is a large sum, I know, Llewellyn. But you must do your best to earn\nit, by diligence and alacrity. I could have sent one of my fine naked\nfellows, and of course not have paid him anything. But the fools near\nthe towns are so fidgety now that they stare at these honest Adamites,\nand talk of them--which would defeat my purpose. Be off with you! I must\ngo and see them. Nothing else refreshes me after talking so long to a\nfellow like you. Here are two guineas for you--one in advance for your\nfirst month\'s wage; the other you will keep until I have done with you,\nand then return it to me.""\n\n""A month, your honour!"" I cried in dismay. ""I never could stop in this\ncountry a month. Why, a week of it would be enough to drive me out of my\nmind almost.""\n\n""You will stay as long as I please, Llewellyn. That second guinea, which\nyou pouched so promptly, is to enable you to come to me, by day or by\nnight, on the very moment you see anything worth reporting. You are\nafraid of the dogs? Yes, all rogues are. Here, take this whistle. They\nare trained to obey it--they will crouch and fawn to you when you blow\nit."" He gave me a few more minute instructions, and then showed me out\nby a little side-door; and all the way back such a weight was upon me,\nand continual presence of strange black eyes, and dread of some hovering\ndanger, that I answered the driver to never a word, nor cared for any of\nhis wondrous stories about the naked people (whose huts we beheld in a\nvalley below us); nay, not even--though truly needing it, and to my own\ngreat amazement--could I manage a drop of my pittance of rum. So the\ndriver got it after all, or at least whatever remained of it, while I\nwished myself back at Old Newton Nottage, and seemed to be wrapped in an\nevil dream. Both horse and driver, however, found themselves not only\nthankful, but light-hearted, at getting away from Nympton Moor. Jack\neven sang a song when five miles off, and in his clumsy way rallied me.\nBut finding this useless, he said that it was no more than he had\nexpected; because it was known that it always befell every man who\nforgot his baptism, and got into dealings with Parson Chowne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nON DUTY.\n\n\nThere are many people who cannot enter into my meaning altogether. This\nI have felt so often that now I may have given utterance to it once or\npossibly twice before. If so, you will find me consistent wholly, and\nquite prepared to abide by it. In all substantial things I am clearer\nthan the noon-day sun itself; and, to the very utmost farthing,\nrighteous and unimpeachable. Money I look at, now and then, when it\ncomes across me; and I like it well enough for the sake of the things it\ngoes for. But as for committing an action below the honour of my family\nand ancestors (who never tuned their harps for less than a mark\na-night), also, and best of all, my own conscience--a power that thumps\nall night like a ghost if I have not strictly humoured it,--for me to\ntalk of such things seems almost to degrade the whole of them.\n\nTherefore, if any one dreams, in his folly, that I would play the spy\nupon that great house over the river, I have no more to say, except that\nhe is not worthy to read my tale. I regard him with contempt, and loathe\nhim for his vile insinuations. Such a man is only fit to take the place\nof a spy himself, and earn perhaps something worth talking of, if his\ninterest let him talk of it. For taking friendly observation of Narnton\nCourt, for its inmates\' sake, I was to have just five shillings a-week!\n\nIt became my duty now to attend to the getting out of the limestone; and\nI fetched it up with a swing that shook every leaf of the Rose of Devon.\nFuzzy attempted to govern me; but I let him know that I would not have\nit, and never knocked under to any man. And if Parson Chowne had come\nalongside, I would have said the same to him.\n\nNevertheless, as an honest man, I took good care to earn my money,\nthough less than the value of one good sewin, or at any rate of a fine\nturbot, each week. No craft of any sort went up or down that blessed\nriver without my laying perspective on her, if there chanced to be light\nenough; or if she slipped along after dark--which is not worth while to\ndo, on account of the shoals and windings--there was I, in our little\ndingy, not so far off as they might imagine. And I could answer for it,\neven with disdainful Chowne looking down through me, that nothing\nlarger than a row-boat could have made for Narnton Court. But I have not\nsaid much of the river as yet; and who can understand me?\n\nThis river bends in graceful courtesies to the sweet land it is leaving,\nand the hills that hold its birth. Also with a vein of terror at the\nunknown sea before it, back it comes, when you grieve to think that it\nmust have said ""good-bye"" for ever. Such a lovely winding river, with so\nmany wilful ways, silvery shallows, and deep, rich shadows, where the\ntrees come down to drink; also, beautiful bright-green meadows, sloping\nto have a taste of it, and the pleaches of bright sand offered to\nsatisfy the tide, and the dark points jutting out on purpose to protect\nit! Many rivers have I seen, nobler, grander, more determined, yet among\nthem all not one that took and led my heart so.\n\nHad I been born on its banks, or among the hills that gaze down over it,\nwhat a song I would have made to it!--although the Bardic inspiration\nseems to have dropped out of my generation, yet will it return with\nfourfold vigour, probably in Bunny\'s children, if she ever has any, that\nis to say, of the proper gender; for the thumb of a woman is weak on the\nharp. And Bunny\'s only aspiration is for ribbons and lollipops, which\nmust be beaten out of her.\n\nHowever, my principal business now was not to admire this river, but\nwatch it; and sometimes I found it uncommonly cold, and would gladly\nhave had quite an ugly river, if less attractive to white frosts. And\nwhat with the clearing of our cargo, and the grumbling afterwards, and\nthe waiting for sailing-orders and never getting any, and the setting-in\nof a sudden gale (which, but for me, must have capsized us when her hold\nwas empty), as well as some more delays which now I cannot stop to think\nof--the middle of October found us still made fast, by stem and stern,\nin Barnstaple river, at Deadman\'s Pill.\n\nParson Chowne (who never happened to neglect a single thing that did\nconcern his interests, any more than he ever happened to forget an\ninjury), twice or thrice a-week he came, mounted on his coal-black mare,\nto know what was going on with us. I saw--for I am pretty sharp, though\nnot pretending to vie with him, as no man might who had not dealt in a\nwholesale mode with the devil--I saw (though the clumsy under-strappers\nmeant me not to notice it) that Bethel Jose, our captain, was no more\nthan a slave of the Parson\'s. This made clear to me quite a lump of what\nhad seemed hopeless mysteries. Touching my poor self, to begin with,\nChowne knew all about me, of course, by means of this dirty Fuzzy. Also\nFuzzy\'s silence now, and the difficulty of working him (with any number\nof sheets in the wind), which had puzzled both Newton and Nottage, and\nthe two public-houses at Porthcawl, and might have enabled him to marry\neven a farmer\'s widow with a rabbit-warren, and Â£350 to dispose of, and\na reputation for sheep\'s-milk cheese, and herself not bad-looking, in\nspite of a beard.\n\nI could see, and could carry home the truth, having thoroughly got to\nthe bottom of it; and might have a chance myself to settle, if I dealt\nmy secret well, with some of the women who had sworn to be single, until\nthat Fuzzy provoked them so. This consideration added, more than can be\nnow described, to my desire to get home before any one got in front of\nme. But Fuzzy, from day to day, pretended that the ketch was not\nvictualled to sail, any more than she was even ballasted. She must load\nwith hay, or with bricks, or pottery, or with something to fill her hold\nand pay freight, or what was to fill our bellies all the way back? And\nso on, and so on; until I was sure that he had some dark reason for\nlingering there.\n\nOf course I had not been such a pure fool--in spite of short seasons for\ngoing from home--as to forget my desire and need to come home, after\nproper interval. The whole of the parish would yearn for me, and so\nwould Ewenny and Llaleston, long ere the Christmas cod comes in; and I\nmade a point in my promises to be back before Gunpowder Treason and\nPlot. As a thoroughly ancient hand at the cannon, I always led the\nfireworks; and the Pope having done something violent lately, they were\nto be very grand this year. What is a man when outside his own\ncountry--a prophet, a magistrate, even a sailor, who has kept well in\nwith his relations? All his old friends are there, longing to praise\nhim, when they hear of good affairs; and as to his enemies--a man of my\nbreadth of nature has none.\n\nThis made it dreadfully grievous for me not to be getting home again;\nand my heart was like a sprouted onion when I thought of Bardie. Bunny\nwould fight on, I knew, and get converted to the Church in the house of\nour churchwarden, and perhaps be baptised after all, which my wife never\nwould have done to her. However, I did not care for that, because no\ngreat harm could come of it; and if the Primitives gave her ribbons, the\nChurch would be bound to grant Honiton lace.\n\nThinking of all my engagements, and compacts, and serious trusteeships,\nand the many yearnings after me, I told Bethel Jose, in so many words,\nthat I was not a black man, but a white man, unable to be trampled on,\nand prepared (unless they could show me better) to place my matter in\nthe hands of his worship, no less than the Mayor of Barnstaple. Fuzzy\ngrinned, and so did Ike; and finding the mayor sitting handsomely upon\nthe very next market-day, I laid my case before him. His worship (as\nkeeping a grocer\'s shop, at which I had bought three pounds of onions,\nand a quarter of a pound of speckled cheese, and half an ounce of\ntobacco) was much inclined to do me justice; and, indeed, began to do so\nin a loud and powerful voice, and eager for people to hearken him. But\nsomebody whispered something to him, containing, no doubt, the great\nParson\'s name, and he shrank back into his hole, and discharged my\nsummons, like a worm with lime laid on his tail.\n\nSuch things are painful; yet no man must insist upon them hardly,\nbecause our ancestors got on among far greater hardships. And it would\nprove us a bad low age if we turned sour about them. We are the finest\nfellows to fight that were ever according to Providence; we ought to be\nthankful for this great privilege (as I mean to show by-and-by), and I\nwould not shake hands with any man, who, for trumpery stuff, would dare\nto make such a terrible force internal.\n\nThis grand soundness of my nature led me to go under orders, though\nacquit of legal contract, only seeking to do the right while receiving\nthe money beforehand. Now this created a position of trust, for it\ninvolved a strong confidence in one\'s honour. Any man paying me\nbeforehand places me at a disadvantage, which is hardly fair of him. I\ndo not like to refuse him, because it would seem so ungraceful; and yet\nI can never be sure but that I ought to take consideration.\n\nNot to dwell too much upon scruples which scarcely any one else might\nfeel, and no other man can enter into, be it enough that my honour now\nwas bound to do what was expected. But what a hardship it was, to be\nsure, to find myself debarred entirely from forming acquaintance, or\nasking questions, or going into the matter in my own style! especially\nnow that my anxiety was quickened beyond bearing to get to the bottom of\nall these wonders about Sir Philip Bampfylde. What had led him to visit\nme? What was he seeking on Braunton Burrows--for now I knew that it must\nbe he? Why did Parson Chowne desire to keep such watch on the visitors\nto Narnton Court by water, while all the world might pass into or out of\nthe house by land? Or did the Parson keep other people watching the\nother side of the house, and prevent me from going near them, lest we\nshould league together to cheat him? This last thing seemed to be very\nlikely, and it proved to be more than that.\n\nRevolving all this much at leisure in the quiet churn of mind, I pushed\noff with my little dingy from the side of the Rose of Devon, when the\nevening dusk was falling, somewhere at October\'s end. This little boat\nnow seemed to be placed at my disposal always, although there used to be\nsuch a fuss, and turn for turn, in taking her. Now the glance of light\non water, and the flowing shadows, keeping humour with the quiet play of\nevening breezes, here a hill and there a tree or rock to be regarded,\nwhile the strong influx of sea with white wisps traced the middle\nchannel, and the little nooks withdrawn under gentle promontories took\nno heed of anything; when the moon came over these, dissipating clouds\nand moving sullen mists aside her track, I found it uncommonly difficult\nto be sure what I was up to. The full moon, lately risen, gazed directly\ndown the river; but memory of daylight still was coming from the\nwestward, feeble, and inclined to yield. What business was all this of\nmine? God makes all things to have turn; and I doubt if He ever meant\nmankind to be always spying into it. Ever so much better go these things\nwithout our bother; and our parson said, being a noble preacher, and fit\nany day for the navy, that the people who conquered the world, according\nto the prophet Joel--20th after Trinity--never noticed nature, never did\nconsult the Lord of Hosts, and yet must have contented Him.\n\nDifficult questions of this colour must be left to parsons (who beat all\nlawyers, out and out, in the matter of pure cleverness; because the\nlatter never can anyhow, but the former, somehow, with the greatest\nease, reconcile all difficulties). The only business I have to deal with\nis what I bodily see, feel, and hear, and have mind to go through with,\nand work out to perfect satisfaction. And this night I found more than\never broke upon my wits before, except when muzzle gapes at muzzle, and\nto blow or be blown up depends upon a single spark.\n\nBecause now, in my quiet manner (growing to be customary, under Parson\nChowne\'s regard) dipping oars, I crossed the river, making slant for\nrunning tide. That man, knowing everybody who might suit his purpose,\nhad employed me rather than old Ikey or even Fuzzy, partly because I\ncould row so well and make no sound in doing it; while either of them,\nwith muffled rowlocks, would splash and grunt, to be heard across river,\nand half-way to Barnstaple Bridge almost. As silently as an owl I\nskimmed across the silent river, not with the smallest desire to spy,\nbut because the poetry of my nature came out strongly. And having this\nupon me still, I rowed my boat into a drooping tree, overhanging a quiet\nnook. Here I commanded the river-front of all that great house, Narnton\nCourt, which stands on the north side of the water over against our\nDeadman\'s Pill. After several voyages under sundry states of light and\nweather, this was now approved to me as the very best point of\nobservation. For all the long and straggling house (quite big enough for\nany three of the magistrates\' houses on our side) could have been taken\nand raked (as it were) like a great ship with her stern to me, from the\nspot where I lay hidden. Such a length it stretched along, with little\nexcept the west end to me, and a show of front-windows dark and void;\nand all along the river-terrace, and the narrow spread of it,\noverlooking the bright water, pagan gods, or wicked things just as bad,\nall standing. However, that was not my business; if the gentry will\nforego the whole of their Christianity, they must answer for themselves,\nwhen the proper time appears. Only we would let them know that we hold\naloof from any breach of their commandments.\n\nA flight of ten wild ducks had been seen coming up the river, every now\nand then, as well as fourteen red-caps, and three or four good wisps of\nteal. Having to see to my victualling now, as well as for the sport of\nit, I loaded the Parson\'s two-foot pistol, which was as good as a gun\nalmost, with three tobacco pipes full of powder poured into each barrel,\nand then a piece of an ancient hat (which Ikey had worn so long that no\nman could distinguish it from wadding), and upon the top of the hat\nthree ounces of leaden pellets, and all kept tight with a good dollop of\noakum. It must kill a wild duck at forty yards, or a red-cap up to\nfifty, if I hit the rogues in the head at all.\n\nThe tide must have been pretty nigh the flood, and the moon was rising\nhazily, and all the river was pale and lonely, for the brown-sailed\nlighters (which they call the ""Tawton fleet"") had long passed by, when I\nheard that silvery sound of swiftness cleaving solitude--the flight of a\nwedge of wild ducks. I knelt in the very smallest form that nature would\nallow of, and with one hand held a branch to keep the boat from surging.\nPlash they came down, after two short turns (as sudden as forked\nlightning), heads down for a moment, then heads up, and wings flapping,\nsousing, and subsiding. Quacks began, from the old drake first, and then\nfrom the rest of the company, and a racing after one another, and a\nrapid gambolling. Under and between them all, the river lost its\nsmoothness, beaten into ups and downs that sloped away in ridge and\nfurrow.\n\nThese fine fellows, as fat as butter after the barley-stubble time,\ncarried on such joy and glory within twenty yards of me that I could not\nbring my gun to bear for quiet shot, so as to settle four. Like an\nancient gunner, I bided my time, being up to the tricks of most of them.\nWhen their wild delight of water should begin to sate itself, what would\nthey do? Why, gather in round the father of the family, and bob their\nheads together. This is the time to be sure of them, especially with two\nbarrels fired at once, as I could easily manage. I never felt surer of\nbirds in my life; I smelt them in the dripping-pan, and beheld myself\nquite basting them, but all of a sudden, up they flew, when I had got\nthree in a line, and waited for two more to come into it, just as the\nmuzzle was true upon them--up and away, and left me nothing except to\nrub my eyes and swear. I might have shot as they rose, but something\ntold me not to do so. Therefore I crept back in my little punt, and\nwaited. In another moment I heard the swing of stout oars pulled with\ntime and power, such as I had not heard for years, nor since myself was\nstroke of it. Of course I knew that this must be a boat of the British\nnavy, probably the captain\'s gig, and choice young fellows rowing her;\nand the tears sprang into my eyes at thought of all the times and things\nbetween, and all the heavy falls of life, since thus I clove the waters.\nAll my heart went out towards her, and I held my breath with longing (as\nI looked between the branches of the dark and fluttering tree), just to\nlet them know that here was one who understood them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTWO LOVERS.\n\n\nThe boat came round the corner swiftly of the wooded stretch of rock,\nwithin whose creek I lay concealed; and the officer in the stern-sheets\ncried, in the short sharp tone of custom, ""Easy, stroke; hold all!"" I\nheard him jerk the rudder-lines, as they passed within biscuit-toss of\nme, and with a heavy sheer he sent her, as if he knew every inch of\nwater, to the steps of Narnton Court: not the handsome balustrade, only\na landing of narrow stone-way nearer to me than the western end, and\nwhere the river-side terrace stopped. Two men sprang ashore and made the\nboat fast at the landing, and then some others lifted out what seemed to\nbe a heavy chest, and placed it on the topmost step, until the officer,\nhaving landed, signed to them to bear it further to a corner of the\nparapet. I could see the whole of these doings, and distinguish him by\nhis uniform, because the boat and the group of sailors were not more\nthan fifty yards from me, and almost in the track of the moon from the\nplace where I was hiding. In a minute or two all returned to the boat,\nwith the exception of the officer, and I heard him give orders from the\nshore--\n\n""Round the point, men! Keep close, and wait for me under the Yellow Hook\nI showed you.""\n\nThe coxswain jumped into the stern-sheets; in a second or two they had\nput about, and the light gig pulling six good oars shot by me, on the\nfirst of the ebb, as swiftly almost as the wild ducks flew. Meanwhile\nthe officer stood and gazed until they had rounded the western point,\nfrom which they had spoiled my shot so; and knowing the vigilant\nkeenness of a British captain\'s eyes, I feared that he might espy my\npunt, which would have disgraced me dreadfully. And even without this I\nfelt how much I would rather be far away. There could have been no man\nmore against my taste to keep a watch upon than a captain in the royal\nnavy, whose father might have been over me. And vigorously as I called\nto mind that all I was doing must be for his good, as well as for that\nof his relatives, I could not find that satisfaction which ought to flow\nfrom such benevolence. However, it now was too late to back out, even if\nmy desire to know the end of this matter allowed of it.\n\nThe officer stood for a minute or two, as if in brown thoughts and deep\nmelancholy, and turned to the house once or twice, and seemed to\nhesitate as to approaching it. The long great house, with the broad\nriver-front, looked all dark and desolate; not a servant, a horse, or\neven a dog was moving, and the only sign of life I could see was a dull\nlight in a little window over a narrow doorway. While I was wondering at\nall this, and the captain standing gloomily, a little dark figure\ncrossed the moonlight from the shadowy doorway, and the officer made a\nstep or two, and held out his arms and received it. They seemed to stay\npretty well satisfied thus, the figure being wholly female, until, with\na sudden change of thought, there seemed to be some sobbing. This led\nthe captain to try again some soft modes of persuasion, such as I could\nnot see into, even if I would have deigned to do a thing against my\ngrain so, because I have been in that way myself, and did not want to be\nlooked at. However, not to be too long over what every man almost goes\nthrough (some honestly, and some anyhow, but all tending to experience),\nmy only desire was, finding them at it, to get out of the way very\nquickly. For, poor as I am, there were several women of Newton, and\nLlaleston, and Ewenny, and even of Bridgend, our market-town, setting\ntheir caps, like springles, at me! Whereas I laboured at nothing else\nbut to pay respect to my poor wife\'s memory, and never have a poor woman\nafter her. And now all these romantic doings made me feel uneasy, and\nready to be infected, so as to settle with nothing more than had been\noffered me thrice, and three times refused--a 7-foot-and-6-inch mangle;\nand (if she proved a tiger) have to work it myself perhaps!\n\nBe that either way, these two unhappy lovers came along, while I was\nwondering at them, yet able to make allowance so, until they must have\nseen me, if they had a corner of an eye for anything less than one\nanother. They stood on a plank that crossed the narrow creek or slot\n(wherein I lay, under a willow full of brown leaves), and scarcely ten\nyards from me. Here there was a rail across, about as big as a\nkidney-bean stick, whereupon they leaned, and looked into the water\nunder them. Then they sighed, and made such sorrow (streaked somehow\nwith happiness) that I got myself ready to leap overboard if either or\nboth of them should jump in. However, they had more sense than that;\nthough they went on very tenderly, and with a soft strain quite unfit to\nbelong to a British officer. Being, from ancient though humble birth,\ngifted with a deal of delicacy, I pulled out two plugs of tobacco, which\nhappened to be in my mouth just now, and I spared them both to stop my\nears, though striking inwards painfully. I tried to hear nothing for\never so long; but I found myself forced to ease out the plugs, they did\nsmart so confoundedly. And this pair wanted some one now to take a\njudicious view of them, for which few men, perhaps, could be found\nbetter qualified than I was. For they carried on in so high a manner,\nthat it seemed as if they could be cured by nothing short of married\nlife, of which I had so much experience. And the principal principle of\nthat state is, that neither party must begin to make too much of the\nother side. But being now over that sort of thing, I found myself snug\nin a corner, and able to view them with interest and considerable\ncandour.\n\n""Is there no hope of it, then, after all; after all you have done and\nsuffered, and the prayers of everybody?"" This was the maiden, of course\nhaving right to the first word, and the last of it.\n\n""There is hope enough, my darling; but nothing ever comes of it. And how\ncan I search out this strange matter, while I am on service always?""\n\n""Throw it up, Drake; my dear heart, for my sake, throw it up, and throw\nover all ambition, until you are cleared of this foul shame.""\n\n""My ambition is slender now,"" he answered, ""and would be content with\none slender lady."" Here he gave her a squeeze, that threatened not only\nto make her slenderer, but also to make the rail need more stoutness,\nand me to keep ready for plunging. ""Nevertheless, you know,"" he went on,\nwhen the plank and the rail put up with it, ""I cannot think of myself\nfor a moment, while I am thus on duty. We expect orders for America.""\n\n""So you said; and it frightens me. If that should be so, what ever, ever\ncan become of us?""\n\n""My own dear, you are a child; almost a child for a man like me, knocked\nabout the world so much, and ever so unfortunate.""\n\nThe rest of his speech was broken into, much to my dissatisfaction, by a\nsoft caressing comfort, such as women\'s pity yields without any\nconsideration. Only they made all sorts of foolish promises, and eternal\npledges, touched up with confidence, and hope, and mutual praise, and\nfaith, and doubt, and the other ins and outs of love.\n\n""I won\'t cry any more,"" she said, with several sobs between it; ""I ought\nnot to be so with you, who are so strong, and good, and kind. Your\nhonour is cruelly wronged at home: you never shall say that your own,\nown love wished you to peril it also abroad.""\n\nHe took her quietly into his arms; and they seemed to strengthen one\nanother. And to my eyes came old tears, or at any rate such as had come\nlong ago. These two people stood a great time, silent, full of one\nanother, keeping close with reverent longing, gazing yet not looking at\nthe moonlight and the water. Then the delicate young maiden (for such\nher voice and outline showed her, though I could not judge her face)\nshivered in the curling fog which the climbing moon had brought.\nHereupon the captain felt that her lungs must be attended to, as well as\nher lips, and her waist, and heart; and he said in a soft way, like a\nshawl--\n\n""Come away, my lovely darling, from the cold, and fog, and mist. Your\nlittle cloak is damp all through; and time it is for me to go.\nDiscipline I will have always; and I must have the same with you, until\nyou take command of me.""\n\n""Many, many a weary year, ere I have the chance of it, Captain Drake.""\nThe young thing sighed as she spoke, though perhaps without any sense of\nprophecy.\n\n""Isabel, let us not talk like that, even if we think it. The luck must\nturn some day, my darling; even I cannot be always on the evil side of\nit. How often has my father said so! And what stronger proof can I have\nthan you? As long as you are true to me----""\n\nThey were turning away, when this bright idea, which seems to occur to\nlovers always, under some great law of nature, to prolong their\ninterviews;--this compelled them to repeat pretty much the same forms,\nand ceremonies, assurances, pledges, and suchlike, which had passed\nbetween them scarcely more than three or four minutes ago, at the\nutmost. And again I looked away, because I would have had others do so\nto me; and there was nothing new to learn by it.\n\n""Only one thing more, my own,"" said the lady, taking his arm again; ""one\nmore thing you must promise me. If you care for me at all, keep out of\nthe way of that dreadful man.""\n\n""Why, how can I meet him at sea, my Bell? Even if he dislikes me, as you\ntell me perpetually, though I never gave him cause, that I know of.""\n\n""He does not dislike you, Drake Bampfylde; he hates you with all the\nvenomous, cold, black hatred, such as I fear to think of--oh my dear, oh\nmy dear!""\n\n""Now, Isabel, try not to be so foolish. I never could believe such a\nthing, and I never will, without clearest proof. I never could feel like\nthat myself, even if any one wronged me deeply. And in spite of all my\nbad luck, Bell, I have never wronged any one. At least more than you\nknow of.""\n\n""Then don\'t wrong me, my own dear love, by taking no heed of yourself.\nHere, there, and everywhere seems to be his nature. You may be proud of\nyour ship and people, and of course they are proud of you. You may be\nordered to Gibraltar, where they have done so gloriously, or to America,\nor to India. But wherever you are, you never can be out of the reach of\nthat terrible man. His ways are so crooked, and so dark, and so\ndreadfully cold-blooded.""\n\n""Isabel, Isabel, now be quiet. What an imagination you have! A man in\nholy orders, a man of a good old family, who have been ancient friends\nof ours----""\n\n""A bad old family, you mean--bad for generations. It does not matter, of\ncourse, what I say, because I am so young and stupid. But you are so\nfrank, and good, and simple, and so very brave and careless, and I know\nthat you will own some day--oh, it frightens mo so to think of it!--that\nyou were wrong in this matter, and your Isabel was right.""\n\nWhat his answer was I cannot tell, because they passed beyond my hearing\nupon their way towards the house. The young lady, with her long hair\nshining like woven gold in the moonlight, tried (so far as I could see)\nto persuade him to come in with her. This, however, he would not do,\nthough grieving to refuse her; and she seemed to know the reason of it,\nand to cease to urge him. In and out of many things, which they seemed\nto have to talk of, he showed her the great chest in the dark corner;\nand perhaps she paid good heed to it. As to that, how can I tell, when\nthey both were so far off, and river-fogs arising? Yet one thing I well\ncould tell, or at any rate could have told it in the times when my blood\nran fast, and my habit of life was romantic. Even though the light was\nfoggy, and there was no time to waste, these two people seemed so to\nstay with a great dislike of severing.\n\nHowever, they managed it at last; and growing so cold in my shoulders\nnow, as well as my knees uncomfortable, right glad was I to hear what\nthe maiden listened to with intense despair; that is to say, the\ncaptain\'s footfall, a yard further off every time of the sound. Ho went\nalong the Braunton road, to find his boat where the river bends. And\nmuch as I longed to know him better, and understand why he did such\nthings, and what he meant by hankering so after this young lady, outside\nhis own father\'s house, and refusing to go inside when invited, and\nspeaking of his own bad luck so much, and having a chest put away from\nthe moonlight, likewise his men in the distance so far, and compelled to\nkeep round the corner, not to mention his manner of walking, and\nswinging his shoulders, almost as if the world was nothing to him;\nalthough I had never been perhaps so thoroughly pushed with desire of\nknowledge, and all my best feelings uppermost, there was nothing for me\nleft except to ponder, and to chow my quid, rowing softly through the\nlanes and lines of misty moonlight, to my little cuddy-home across the\ntidal river.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nAMONG THE SAVAGES.\n\n\nAt this moment it became a very nice point to perceive what was really\nhonest and right, and then to carry it out with all that fearless\nalacrity, which in such cases I find to be, as it were, constitutional\nto me. My high sense of honour would fain persuade me to keep in\nstrictest secrecy that which (so far as I could judge) was not, or might\nnot have been, intended for my eyes, or ears, or tongue. On the other\nhand, my still higher sense of duty to my employer (which is a most\nneedful and practical feeling), and that power of loyalty which descends\nto me, and perhaps will die with me, as well as a strong, and no less\nancestral, eagerness to be up to the tricks of all mysterious beings--I\ndo not exaggerate when I say that the cut-water of my poor mind knew not\nwhich of these two hands pulled the stronger oar.\n\nIn short, being tired, and sleepy, and weary, and worn out with want of\nperceiving my way, although I smoked three pipes all alone (not from the\nsmallest desire for them, but because I have routed the devil thus many\nand many a night I know--as the priests do with their incense; the\nreason of which I take to be, that having so much smoke at home, he\nshuns it when coming for change of air--growing dreamy thus), I said,\nwith nobody to answer me, ""I will tumble into my berth, as this dirty\ncraft has no room for hammocks; and, between Parson and Captain, I will\nleave my dreams to guide me.""\n\nI played with myself, in saying this. No man ever should play with\nhimself. It shows that he thinks too troublesomely; and soon may come,\nif he carries it on, almost to forget that other people are nothing,\nwhile himself is everything. And if any man comes to that state of mind,\nthere is nothing more to hope of him.\n\nI was not so far gone as that. Nevertheless, it served me right (for\nthinking such dreadful looseness) to have no broad fine road of sleep,\nin the depth whereof to be borne along, and lie wherever wanted; but\ninstead of that to toss and kick, with much self-damage, and worst of\nall, to dream such murder that I now remember it. What it was, belongs\nto me, who paid for it with a loss of hair, very serious at my time of\nlife. However, not to dwell upon that, or upon myself in any way--such\nbeing my perpetual wish, yet thwarted by great activity--let it be\nenough to say that Parson Chowne in my visions came and horribly stood\nover me.\n\nTherefore, arising betimes, I hired a very fine horse, and, manning him\nbravely, laid his head east and by south, as near as might be, according\nto our binnacle. But though the wind was abaft the beam, and tide and\nall in his favour, and a brave commander upon his poop, what did he do\nbut bouse his stem, and run out his spanker-driver, and up with his\ntaffrail, as if I was wearing him in a thundering heavy sea. I resolved\nto get the upper hand of this uncalled-for mutiny; and the more so\nbecause all our crew were gazing, and at the fair I had laid down the\nlaw very strictly concerning horses. I slipped my feet out of the\nchains, for fear of any sudden capsize, and then I rapped him over the\ncatheads, where his anchor ought to hang. He, however, instead of doing\nat all what I expected, up with his bolt-sprit and down with his\nquarter, as if struck by a whale under his forefoot. This was so far\nfrom true seamanship, and proved him to be so unbuilt for sailing, that\nI was content to disembark over his stern, and with slight concussions.\n\n""Never say die"" has always been my motto, and always will be: nailing my\ncolours to the mast, I embarked upon another horse of less than half the\ntonnage of that one who would not answer helm. And this craft, being\nbroken-backed, with a strange sound at her port-holes, could not under\npress of sail bowl along more than four knots an hour. And we adjusted\nmatters between us so, that when she was tired I also was sore, and\ntherefore disembarked and towed her, until we were both lit for sea\nagain. Therefore it must have been good meridian when I met Parson\nChowne near his house.\n\nThis man was seldom inside his own house, except at his meal-times, or\nwhen asleep, but roving about uncomfortably, seeing to the veriest\ntrifles, everywhere abusing or kicking everybody. And but for the\ncertainty of his witchcraft (ninefold powerful, as they told me, when\nconferred upon a parson), and the black strength of his eyes, and the\ndoom that had befallen all who dared to go against him, the men about\nthe yards and stables told me--when he was miles away--that they never\ncould have put up with him; for his wages were also below their deserts.\n\nHe came to me from the kennel of hounds, which he kept not for his own\npleasure so much as for the delight of forbidding gentlemen, whenever\nthe whim might take him so, especially if they were nobly accoutred,\nfrom earning at his expense the glory of jumping hedges and ditches.\nNow, as he came towards me, or rather beckoned for me to come to him, I\nsaw that the other truly eminent parson, the Reverend John Rambone, was\nwith him, and giving advice about the string at the back of a young\ndog\'s tongue. Although this man was his greatest friend, Master Chowne\ntreated him no better than anybody else would fare; but signed to the\nmate of the hounds, or whatever those fox-hunters call their chief\nofficer, to heed every word of what Rambone said. Because these two\ndivines had won faith, throughout all parishes and hundreds: Chowne for\nthe doctrine of horses; and for discipline of dogs, John Rambone.\n\nHis Reverence fixed a stern gaze upon me, because I had not hurried\nmyself--a thing which I never do except in a glorious naval action--and\nthen he bade me follow him. This I did; and I declare even now I cannot\ntell whither he took me. For I seemed to have no power, in his presence,\nof heeding anything but himself: only I know that we passed through\ntrees, and sate down somewhere afterwards. Wherever it was, or may have\nbeen, so far as my memory serves, I think that I held him at bay some\nlittle. For instance, I took the greatest care not to speak of the fair\nyoung lady; inasmuch as she might not have done all she did, if she had\nchanced to possess the knowledge of my being under the willow-tree. But\nParson Chowne, without my telling, knew the whole of what was done; and\nwhat he thought of it none might guess in the shadowy shining of his\neyes.\n\n""You have done pretty well on the whole,"" he said, after asking many\nshort questions; ""but you must do better next time, my man. You must not\nallow all these delicate feelings, chivalry, resolute honesty, and\nlittle things of that sort, to interfere thus with business. These\nthings do some credit to you, Llewellyn, and please you, and add to your\nhappiness, which consists largely with you (as it does with all men) in\nconceit. But you must not allow yourself thus to coquet with these\nbeauties of human nature. It needs a rich man to do that. Even add my\nfive shillings to your own four, and you cannot thus go to Corinth.""\n\nI had been at Corinth twice, and found it not at all desirable; so I\ncould not make out what his Reverence meant, except that it must be\nsomething bad; which at my time of life should not be put into the mind\neven by a clergyman. But what I could least put up with was, the want of\nencouragement I found for all my better feelings. These seemed to meet\nwith nothing more than discouragement and disparagement, whereas I knew\nthem to be sound, substantial, and solid; and I always felt upon going\nto bed what happiness they afforded me. And if the days of my youth had\nonly passed through learned languages, Latin and Greek and Hebrew, I\ndoubt whether even Parson Chowne could have laid his own will upon me\nso.\n\n""Supposing, then, that your Reverence should make it ten,"" I answered;\n""with my own four, that would be fourteen.""\n\n""I can truly believe that it would, my man. And you may come to that, if\nyou go on well. Now go into the house and enjoy yourself. You Welshmen\nare always hungry. And you may talk as freely as you like; which is your\nnext desire. Every word you say will come back to me; and some of it may\namuse me. If you have no sense you have some cunning. You will know what\nthings to speak of. And be sure that you wait until I come back.""\n\nThis was so wholly below and outside of the thing which I love to\nreconcile with my own constitution (having so long been respected for\nthem, as well as rewarded by conscience), that I scarcely knew where or\nwho I was, or what might next come over me. And to complete my\nuncomfortable sense of being nobody, I heard the sound of a galloping\nhorse downhill as wild as could be, and found myself left as if all the\nideas which I was prepared to suggest were nothing. However, that was\nnot my loss, but his; so I entered the house, with considerable hope of\nenjoying myself, as commanded. For this purpose I have always found it,\nin the house of a gentleman, the height of luck to get among three young\nwomen and one old one. The elderly woman attends to the cooking, which\nis not understood by the young ones, or at any rate cannot be much\nexpected; while, on the other hand, the young ones flirt in and out in a\npleasant way, laying the table and showing their arms (which are of a\nlovely red, as good as any gravy); and then if you know how to manage\nthem well, with a wholesome deference to the old cook, and yet an\nunderstanding--while she is basting, and as one might almost say, behind\nher back--a confidential feeling established that you know how she\ntreats those young ones, and how harshly she dares to speak, if a coal\ncomes into the dripping-pan, and in casting it out she burns her face,\nand abuses the whole of them for her own fault; also a little shy\nsuggestion that they must put up with all this, because the old cook is\npast sweethearting time, and the parlour-maid scarcely come to it,\naccompanied by a wink or two, and a hint in the direction of the\nstables--some of the very noblest dinners that ever I made have been\nthus introduced. But what forgiveness could I expect, or who would\nlisten to me, if I dared to speak in the same dinner-hour of the goodly\nkitchen at Candleston Court, or even at Court Ysha, and the place that\nserved as a sort of kitchen, so far as they seemed to want one, at this\nNympton Rectory? A chill came over every man, directly he went into it;\nand he knew that his meat would be hocks and bones, and his gravy (if\nany) would stand cold dead. However, I made the best of it, as my manner\nis with everything; and though the old stony woman sate, and seemed to\nmake stone of every one, I kept my spirits up, and became (in spite of\nall her stoppage) what a man of my knowledge of mankind must be among\nwomankind. In a word, though I do not wish to set down exactly how I\nmanaged it, in half an hour I could see, while carefully concealing it,\nthat there was not a single young woman there without beginning to say\nto herself, ""Should I like to be Mrs Llewellyn?"" After that, I can have\nthem always. But I know them too well, to be hasty. No prospects would\nsuit me, at my time of life, unless they came after some cash in hand.\nThe louts from the stables and kennels poured in, some of them very\n""degustin"" (as my Bardie used to say), nevertheless the girls seemed to\nlike them; and who was I, even when consulted, to pretend to say\notherwise? In virtue of what I had seen, among barbarous tribes and\neverywhere, and all my knowledge of ceremonies, and the way they marry\none another, it took me scarcely half an hour (especially among poor\nvictuals) to have all the women watching for every word I was prepared\nto drop. Although this never fails to happen, yet it always pleases me;\nand to find it in Parson Chowne\'s kitchen go thus, and the stony woman\nherself compelled to be bitten by mustard for fear of smiling, and two\nor three maids quite unfit to get on without warm pats on their\nshoulder-blades, and the dogs quite aware that men were laughing, and\nthat this meant luck for them if they put up their noses; it was not for\nme to think much of myself; and yet how could I help doing it?\n\nIn the midst of this truly social joy, and natural commune over\nvictuals, and easing of thought to suit one another in the courtesies of\ndigestion; and just as the slowest amongst us began to enter into some\nknowledge of me, in walked that great Parson Rambone, with his hands\nbehind his back, and between them a stout hunting-crop. The maidens\nseemed to be taken aback, but the men were not much afraid of him.\n\n""What a rare royster you are making! Out by the kennel I heard you.\nHowever can I write my sermons?""\n\n""Does your Reverence write them in the kennel?"" Thus the chief huntsman\nmade inquiry, having a certain privilege.\n\n""Clear out, clear out,"" said Rambone, fetching his whip toward all of\nus; ""I am left in authority here, and I must have proper discipline. Mrs\nSteelyard, I am surprised at you. Girls, you must never go on like this.\nWhat will his Reverence say to me? Come along with me, thou villain\nWelshman, and give me a light for my pipe, if you please.""\n\nIt was a sad thing to behold a man of this noble nature, having gifts of\neverything (whether of body, or heart, or soul), only wanting gift of\nmind; and for want of that alone, making wreck of all the rest. I let\nhim lead me; while I felt how I longed to have the lead of him. But that\nwas in stronger hands than mine.\n\n""Come, and I\'ll show thee a strange sight, Taffy,"" he said to me very\npleasantly, as soon as his pipe was kindled; ""only I must have my horse,\nto inspire them with respect for me, as well as to keep my distance.\nWhere is thy charger, thou valiant Taffy?""\n\nI answered his Reverence that I would rather travel afoot, if it were\nnot too far; neither could he persuade me, after the experience of that\nmorning, to hoist my flag on an unknown horse, the command of which he\noffered me. So forth we set, the Parson on horseback, and in very high\nspirits, trolling songs, leaping hedges, frolicking enough to frighten\none, and I on foot, rather stiff and weary, and needing a glass of grog,\nwithout any visible chance of getting it.\n\n""Here, you despondent Taffy; take this, and brighten up a bit. It is\ntrue you are going to the gallows; but there\'s no room for you there\njust now.""\n\nI saw what he meant, as he handed me his silver hunting-flask, for they\nhave a fashion about there of hanging bad people at cross ways, and\nleaving them there for the good of others, and to encourage honesty. And\ntruly the place was chosen well; for in the hollow not far below it,\nmight be found those savage folk, of whom I said something a good while\nago. And I did not say then what I might have said; because I felt\nscandalised, and unwilling to press any question of doubtful doings upon\nthoroughly accomplished people. But now I am bound, like a hospital\nsurgeon, to display the whole of it.\n\n""Take hold of the tail of my horse, old Taffy,"" said his Reverence to\nme; ""and I will see you clear of them. Have no fear, for they all know\nme.""\n\nBy this time we were surrounded with fifteen or twenty strange-looking\ncreatures, enough to frighten anybody. Many fine savages have I seen--on\nthe shores of the Land of Fire, for instance, or on the coast of Guinea,\nor of the Gulf of Panama, and in fifty other places--yet none did I ever\ncome across so outrageous as these were. They danced, and capered, and\ncaught up stones, and made pretence to throw at us; and then, with\nhorrible grimaces, showed their teeth and jeered at us. Scarcely any of\nthe men had more than a piece of old sack upon him; and as for the\nwomen, the less I say, the more you will believe it. My respect for\nrespectable women is such that I scarcely dare to irritate them, by not\nsaying what these other women were as concerns appearance. And yet I\nwill confine myself, as if of the female gender, to a gentle hint that\nthese women might have looked much nicer, if only they had clothes on.\n\nBut the poor little ""piccaninies,"" as the niggers call them these poor\nlittle devils were far worse off than any hatch of negroes, or Maroons,\nor copper-colours anywhere in the breeding-grounds. Not so much from any\nwant of tendance or clean management, which none of the others ever got;\nbut from difference of climate, and the moisture of their native soil.\nThese little creatures, all stark naked, seemed to be well enough off\nfor food, of some sort or another, but to be very badly off for want of\nwashing and covering up. And their little legs seemed to be growing\ncrooked; the meaning of which was beyond me then; until I was told that\nit took its rise from the way they were forced to crook them in, to lay\nhold of one another\'s legs, for the sake of natural warmth and comfort,\nas the winter-time came on, when they slept in the straw all together. I\nbelieve this was so; but I never saw it.\n\nThe Reverend John Rambone took no other notice of these people than to\nbe amused with them. He knew some two or three of the men, and spoke of\nthem by their nicknames, such as ""Browny,"" or ""Horse-hair,"" or ""Sandy\nboy;"" and the little children came crawling on their bellies to him.\nThis seemed to be their natural manner of going at an early age: and\nonly one of all the very little children walked upright. This one came\nto the Parson\'s horse, and being still of a tottery order, laid hold of\na fore-leg to fetch up his own; and having such moorage, looked up at\nthe horse. The horse, for his part, looked down upon him, bending his\nneck, as if highly pleased; yet with his nostrils desiring to snort, and\nthe whole of his springy leg quivering, but trying to keep quiet, lest\nthe baby might be injured. This made me look at the child again, whose\nlittle foolish life was hanging upon the behaviour of a horse. The rider\nperceived that he could do nothing, in spite of all his great strength\nand skill, to prevent the horse from dashing out the baby\'s brains with\nhis fore-hoof, if only he should rear or fret. And so he only soothed\nhim. But I, being up to all these things, and full for ever of presence\nof mind, slipped in under the hold of the horse, as quietly as possible,\nand in a manner which others might call at the same time daring and\ndexterous, I fetched the poor little fellow out of his dangerous\nposition.\n\n""Well done, Taffy!"" said Parson Jack; ""I should never have thought you\nhad sense enough for it. You had a narrow shave, my man.""\n\nFor the horse, being frightened by so much nakedness, made a most sudden\nspring over my body, before I could rise with the child in my arms; and\none of his after-hoofs knocked my hat off, so that I felt truly thankful\nnot to have had a worse business of it. But I would not let any one\nlaugh at my fright.\n\n""A miss is as good as a mile, your Reverence. Many a cannon-ball has\npassed me nearer than your horse\'s hoof. Tush, a mere trifle! Will your\nReverence give this poor little man a ride?"" And with that I offered him\nthe child upon his saddlebow, naked, and unwashed, and kicking.\n\n""Keep off, or you shall taste my horsewhip. Keep away with your dirty\nbrat--and yet--oh, poor little devil! If I only had a cloth with me!""\n\nFor this parson was of tender nature, although so wild and reckless; and\nin his light way he was moved at the wretched plight of this small\ncreature, and the signs of heavy stripes upon him. Not all over him, as\nthe Parson said, being prone to exaggerate; but only extending over his\nback, and his hams, and other convenient places. And perhaps my jacket\nmade them smart, for he roared every time I lifted him. And every time I\nset him down, he stared with a wistful kind of wonder at our clothes,\nand at the noble horse, as if he were trying to remember something.\n""Where can they have picked up this poor little beggar?"" said Parson\nJack, more to himself than to me: ""he looks of a different breed\naltogether. I wonder if this is one of Stoyle\'s damned tricks."" And all\nthe way back he spoke never a word, but seemed to be worrying with\nhimself. But I having set the child down on his feet, and dusted my\nclothes, and cleaned myself, followed the poor little creature\'s toddle,\nand examined him carefully. The rest of the children seemed to hate him,\nand he, to shrink out of their way almost; and yet he was the only fine\nand handsome child among them. For in spite of all the dirt upon it, his\nface was honest, and fair, and open, with large soft eyes of a dainty\nblue, and short thick curls of yellow hair that wanted combing sadly.\nAnd though he had rolled in muddy places, as little wild children always\ndo, for the sake of keeping the cold out, his skin was white, where the\nmud had peeled, and his form lacked nothing but washing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nIN A STATE OF NATURE.\n\n\nNow all these things contributed, coming as they did so rapidly, to\narouse inside me a burning and almost desperate curiosity. It was in\nvain that I said to myself, ""these are no concerns of mine: let them\nmanage their own affairs: the less I meddle, the better for me: I seem\nto be in a barbarous land, and I must expect things barbarous. And after\nall, what does it come to, compared with the great things I have seen,\nay, and played my part in?"" To reason thus, and regard it thus, and seek\nonly to be quit of it, was a proof of the highest wisdom any man could\nmanifest: if he could only stick to it. And this I perceived, and thus I\nfelt, and praised myself for enforcing it so; until it became not only\nsafe, but a bounden duty to reward my conscience by a little talk or so.\n\nHence I lounged into the stable-yard--for that terrible Chowne was not\nyet come back, neither were maids to be got at for talking, only that\nstony Steelyard--and there I found three or four shirt-sleeved fellows,\nhissing at horses, and rubbing away, to put their sleeping polish on\nthem, before the master should return. Also three or four more were\nlabouring in the stalls very briskly, one at a sort of holy-stoning,\nmaking patterns with brick and sand, and the others setting up the\nhammocks for the nags to lie in, with a lashing of twisted straw aft of\ntheir after-heels and taffrails, as the wake of a ship might be. And all\nof it done most ship-shape. This amused me mightily; for I never had\nseen such a thing before, even among wild horses, who have power to\nmanage their own concerns. But to see them all go in so snugly, and with\nsuch a sweet, clean savour, each to his own oats or mashings, with the\ngolden straw at foot, made me think, and forced me to it, of those\nwretched white barbarians (white, at least, just here and there), whom\ngood Parson Jack--as one might almost try to call him--had led me to\nvisit that same afternoon.\n\nPerceiving how the wind sate, I even held back, and smoked a pipe,\nexactly as if I were overseer, and understood the whole of it, yet did\nnot mean to make rash reproach. This had a fine effect upon them,\nespecially as I chewed a straw, by no means so as to stop my pipe, but\nto exhibit mastery. And when I put my leg over a rail, as if I found it\ndifficult to keep myself from horseback, the head-man came to me\nstraightforward, and asked me when I had hunted last.\n\nI told him that I was always hunting, week-days, and Sundays, and all\nthe year round, because it was our fashion; and that we hunted creatures\nsuch as he never had the luck to set eyes on. And when I had told him a\nfew more things (such as flow from experience, when mixed with\nimagination), a duller man than myself might see that he longed for me\nto sup with him. And he spoke of things that made me ready, such as\ntripe and onions.\n\nHowever, this would never do. I felt myself strongly under orders; and\nbut for this paramount sense of duty, never could I have done the things\nmodestly mentioned as of yore; and those of hereafter tenfold as fine,\nsuch as no modesty dare suppress. So, when I had explained to him\nexactly how I stood about it, he did not refuse to fill his pipe with a\nbit of my choice tobacco, and to come away from all idle folk, to a\nplace in the shelter of a rick, where he was sure to hear the hoofs of\nhis master\'s horse returning. I sate with him thus, and we got on well;\nand as he was going to marry soon the daughter of a publican, who had as\ngood as fifty pounds, and nothing that could be set on fire, and lived\nfifty miles away almost, he did not mind telling me all the truth,\nbecause he saw that I could keep it; and at his age he could not enter\ninto the spirit of being kicked so. I told him I should like to see a\nman kick me! But he said that I might come to it.\n\nThis was a very superior man, and I durst not contradict him; and having\narranged so to settle in life, how could he hope to tell any more lies?\nFor I have always found all men grow pugnaciously truthful, so to put\nit, for a month almost before wedlock; while the women are doing the\nopposite. However, not to go far into that, what he told me was much as\nfollows:--\n\nParson Chowne, in early life, before his mind was put into shape for\nanything but to please itself, had been dreadfully vexed and thwarted.\nEvery matter had gone amiss, directly he was concerned in it; his\nguardians had cheated him, so had his step-mother, so had his favourite\nuncle, and of course so had his lawyers done. In the thick of that\nbitterness, what did his sweetheart do but throw him over. She took a\ngreat scare of his strange black eyes, when she found that his money was\ndoubtful. This was instinct, no doubt, on her part, and may have been a\ngreat saving for her; but to him it was terrible loss. His faith was\nalready astray a little; but a dear wife might have brought it back, or\nat any rate made him think so. And he was not of the nature which gropes\nafter the bottom of everything, like a twisting augur. Having a prospect\nof good estates, he was sent to London to learn the law, after finishing\nat Oxford, not that he might practise it, but to introduce a new element\nto the county magistrates, when he should mount the bench among them.\nHere he got rogued, as was only natural, and a great part of his land\nfell from him, and therefore he took to the clerical line; and being of\na stern and decided nature, he married three wives, one after the other,\nand thus got a good deal of property. It was said, of course, as it\nalways is of any man thrice a widower, that he or his manner had killed\nhis wives; a charge which should never be made without strong evidence\nin support of it. At any rate there had been no children; and different\nopinions were entertained whether this were the cause or effect of the\nParson\'s dislike and contempt of little ones. Moreover, as women usually\nare of a tougher staple than men can be, Chowne\'s successive liberation\nfrom three wives had added greatly to his fame for witchcraft, such as\nfirst accrued from his commanding style, nocturnal habits, method of\nquenching other people, and collection of pots and kettles. The\nhead-groom told me, with a knowing wink, that in his opinion the Parson\nwas now looking after wife No. 4, for he never had known him come out so\nsmart with silver heels and crested head-piece, and even the mark of the\nsaddle must not show upon his breeches. This was a sure sign, he\nthought, that there was a young lady in the wind, possessing both money\nand good looks, such as Chowne was entitled to, and always had insisted\non. Upon that point I could have thrown some light (if prudence had\npermitted it), or at least I had some shrewd suspicions, after what\nhappened beside the river; however, I said nothing. But I asked him what\nin his opinion first had soured the young man Chowne against the whole\nof the world so sadly, as he seemed to retain it now. And he answered me\nthat he could not tell, inasmuch as the cause which he had heard given\nseemed to him to be most unlikely, according to all that he saw of the\nman. Nevertheless I bade him tell it, being an older man than he was,\nand therefore more able to enter into what young folk call\n""inconsistencies."" And so he told me that it was this. Chowne, while\nstill a young boy, had loved, with all the force of his heart, a boy a\nfew years younger than himself, a cousin of his own, but not with\nprospects such as he had. And this boy had been killed at school, and\nthe matter hushed up comfortably among all high authorities. But Stoyle\nChowne had made a vow to discover and hunt it out to the uttermost, and\nsooner or later to have revenge. But when his own wrongs fell upon him,\ndoubtless he had forgotten it. I said that I did not believe he had done\nso, or ever would, to the uttermost.\n\nThen I asked about Parson Jack, and heard pretty much what I expected.\nThat he was a well-meaning man enough, although without much sense of\nright or wrong, until his evil star led him into Parson Chowne\'s\nsociety. But still he had instincts now and then, such as a horse has,\nof the right road; and an old woman of his church declared that he did\nfeel his own sermons, and if let alone, and listened to, might come to\nact up to them. I asked whether Parson Chowne might do the like, but was\ntold that he never preached any.\n\nWe were talking thus, and I had quite agreed to his desire of my company\nfor supper-time, when the sound of a horse upon stony ground, tearing\nalong at a dangerous speed, quite broke up our conference. The groom, at\nthe sound of it, damped out his pipe, and signified to me to do the\nsame.\n\n""I have fired a-many of his enemies\' ricks,"" he whispered, in his haste\nand fright; ""but if he were to smell me a-smoking near to a rick of his\nown, good Lord!"" and he pointed to a hay-rope, as if he saw his halter.\nAnd though he had boasted of speedy marriage, and caring no fig for\nParson Chowne, he set off for the stables at a pace likely to prove\ninjurious to his credit for consistency.\n\nOn the other hand, I, in a leisurely manner, picked myself up from the\nattitude natural to me when listening kindly, and calmly asserting my\nright to smoke, approached the track by which I knew that the rider must\ncome into the yard; for all the dogs had no fear of me now, by virtue of\nthe whistle which I bore. And before I had been there half a minute, the\nParson dashed up with his horse all smoking, and himself in a heavy\nblackness of temper, such as I somehow expected of him.\n\n""No Jack here! not a Jack to be seen. Have the kindness to look for my\nstable-whip. Ho, Llewellyn is it?""\n\n""Yes, your Reverence, David Llewellyn, once of his Majesty\'s Royal Navy,\nand now of----""\n\n""No more of that! You have played me false. I expected it from a rogue\nlike you. Restore me that trust-guinea.""\n\nThis so largely differed from what even Anthony Stew would dare to say\nin conversation with me (much less at times of evidence), that I lifted\nup my heart to heaven, as two or three preachers had ordered me; and\neven our parson had backed it up, with lineage at least as good and\nperhaps much better than Parson Chowne\'s, by right of Welsh blood under\nit: the whole of this overcame me so, that I could only say, ""What\nguinea, sir?""\n\n""What guinea, indeed! You would rob me, would you? Don\'t you know better\nthan that, my man? Come to me in two hours\' time. Stop, give me that\ndog\'s whistle!""\n\nTaking that heed of me, and no more, he cast the reins to my friend the\nhead-groom, who came up, looking for all the world as if never had he\nseen me, and wondered strangely who I could be. And this air of fright\nand denial always pervaded the whole household. All of which was quite\nagainst what I had been long accustomed to, wherever I deigned to go in\nwith my news to the servants\' place, or the housekeeper\'s room, or\nanywhere pointed out to me as the best for entertainment. Here, however,\nalthough the servants seemed to be plentiful enough, and the horses and\nthe hounds to have as much as they could eat, there was not a trace of\nwhat I may call good domestic comfort. When this prevails, as it ought\nto do in every gentleman\'s household, the marks may be discovered in the\neyes and the mouth of everybody. Nobody thinks of giving way to\ninjudicious hurry when bells ring, or when shouts are heard, or horses\'\nfeet at the front door. And if on the part of the carpeted rooms any\ndisquietude is shown, or desire to play, or feed, or ride, at times\noutside the convenience of the excellent company down-stairs, there is\nnothing more to be said, except that it cannot be done, and should never\nin common reason have been thought of. For all servants must enjoy their\nmeals, and must have time to digest them with proper ease for\nconversation and expansion afterwards. At Candleston Court it was always\nso; and so it should be everywhere.\n\nHowever, to return to my groom, whose cordiality revived at the moment\nhis master turned the corner, perceiving that Chowne had some matter on\nhand which would not allow him to visit the stables, just for the\npresent at any rate, he turned the black mare over to the care of an\nunderstrapper, and with a wink and a smack of his lips, gave me to know\nthat his supper was toward. Neither were we disappointed, but found it\nall going on very sweetly, in a little private room used for cleaning\nharness. And he told me that this young cook maid, of unusual abilities,\nhad attached herself to him very strongly, with an eye to promotion, and\nhaving no scent of his higher engagement: neither would he have been\nunwilling to carry out her wishes if she could only have shown a\nsixpence against the innkeeper\'s daughter\'s shilling. I told him that he\nwas too romantic, and he said with a sigh that he could not help it; but\nall would come right in the end, no doubt.\n\nThis honest affection impressed me not a little in his favour, and in\nless than half an hour I found him a thoroughly worthy fellow: while he\nperceived, through a square-stalked rummer, that my character was\ncongenial. I told him therefore some foreign stories, many of which were\nexceedingly true, and he by this time was ready to answer almost\nanything that I chose to ask, even though he knew nothing about it. As\nfor the people that wore no clothes, but lived all together in the old\nmud-house, there need be and could be no mystery. Every one knew that\nhis Reverence had picked them up in his early days, and been pleased\nwith their simple appearance and dislike of cultivation. Perceiving even\nthen how glad he might be, in after-life, to annoy his neighbours, what\ndid he do but bring these people (then six in number, and all of them\nwives and husbands to one another) and persuade them to dig themselves\nout a house, and by deed of gift establish them on forty acres of their\nown land, so that, as Englishmen love to say, their house was now their\ncastle. Not that these were perhaps English folk, but rather of a Gipsy\ncross, capable, however, of becoming white if a muscular man should\nscrub them. The groom said that nobody durst go near them, except Parson\nChowne and Parson Jack, and that they seemed to get worse and worse, as\nthey began to be persecuted by clothes-wearing people. I asked him what\ntheir manners were; and he said he believed they were good enough, so\nlong as not interfered with; and who could blame them for maintaining\nthat whether they wore clothes or not was entirely their own concern:\nalso, that if outer strangers intruded, from motives of low curiosity,\nupon their unclad premises, it was only fair to point out to them the\ndisadvantages of costume, by making it very hard to wash? There was some\nsense in this, because the main anxiety of mankind is to convert one\nanother; and the pelting of mud is usually the beginning of such\novertures. And these fine fellows having recurred (as Parson Chowne\nsaid) to a natural state, their very first desire would be to redeem all\nfellow-creatures from the evils of civilisation. Whereof the foremost\nperhaps is clothes, and the time we take in dressing--a twelfth part of\ntheir waking life, with even the wisest women, and with the unwise\nvirgins, often not less than three-quarters; and with many men not much\nbetter.--But to come back to my savages. I asked this good groom how it\ncame to pass that none of the sheriffs, or deputies, or even magistrates\nof the shire, put down this ungoodly company. He said that they had\ntried, but failed, according to the laws of England, on the best\nauthority. Because these men of the ancient Adam went back to the time\nbefore the beasts had come to Adam to get their names. They brought up\ntheir children without a name, and now all names were dying out, and\nthey agreed much better in consequence. And how could any writ, warrant,\nor summons, run against people without a name? It had once been tried\nwith a ""Nesho Kiss,"" the meaning of which was beyond me; but Parson\nChowne upset that at once; and the bailiff was fit to make bricks of.\n\nAt this I shook my head and smiled; because we put up with many evils on\nour side of the water, but never with people so unbecoming in their\nmanner of life and clothes. And I thought how even mild Colonel Lougher\nwould have behaved upon such a point, and how sharp Anthony Stew would\nhave stamped when they began to pelt him; and how I wished him there to\ntry it!\n\nNevertheless I desired to know what victuals these good barbarians had;\nbecause, although like the Indian Jogis (mentioned by some great\ntraveller) they might prove their right to go without clothes, which\nnever were born upon them, they could not to my mind prove their power\nto do so well without victuals. He answered that this was a clever thing\non my part to inquire about; but that I was so far wrong that these\npeople would eat anything. His Reverence sent them every week the refuse\nof his garden, as well as of stable-yard and kennel, and they had a gift\nof finding food in everything around them. Their favourite dish--so to\nsay, when they had never a dish among them--was what they discovered in\nthe pasture-land; and this they divided carefully; accounting it the\ndepth of shame, and the surest mark of civilisation, to cheat one\nanother. But they could not expect to get this every day, in a\nneighbourhood of moorland; therefore, instead of grumbling, they did\ntheir best to get on without it. And Providence always sends thousands\nof victuals for all whose stomachs have not been ruined by thinking too\nmuch about them; or very likely through the women beginning to make them\ndelicate. So when a man is sea-sick, he thinks of and hates almost\neverything.\n\nOn the other hand, these noble fellows hated nothing that could be\nchewed. Twenty-one sorts of toad-stool, with the insects which inhabit\nthem; three varieties of eft, and of frogs no less than seven; also\nslugs six inches long, too large to have a house built; moles that live\nin lines of decks, like a man-of-war\'s-man; also rats, and brindled\nhedgehogs, and the grubs of hornets (which far surpass all\noysters)--these, and other little things, like goat-moths, leopards, and\nmoney-grubs, kept them so alive as never to come down on the parish.\nNeither was there any hen-roost, rick-yard, apple-room, or dairy, on the\nfarms around them, but in it they found nourishment. Into all this I\ncould enter, while the groom only showed the door of it.\n\nBut while we were talking thus, I heard the stable-clock strike eight,\nwhich brought Hezekiah to my mind, and my own church-clock at Newton. It\nstruck in such a manner, that I saw the door of my own cottage, also\nBunny in bed, with her nostrils ready to twitch for snoring, and Mother\nJones, with a candle, stooping to ease her by means of a drop of hot\ngrease; and inside, by the wall, lay Bardie, sleeping (as she always\nslept) with a smile of high-born quietude. And what would all three say\nto me if ever I got back again?\n\nThanking this excellent groom for all his hospitality to me, and\npromising at his desire to keep it from his master, I took my way (as\npointed out) to the room where his Reverence might be found. I feared\nthat his temper would be black, unless he had dined as I had supped, and\ntaken a good glass afterwards. And I could not believe what the groom\nhad told me concerning one particular. There is a most utterly pestilent\nrace arising, and growing up around us, whose object is to destroy old\nEngland, by forbidding a man to drink. St Paul speaks against them, and\nall the great prophets; and the very first thing that was done by our\nLord, after answering them in the Temple, was to put them to shame with\na great many firkins. Also one of the foremost parables is concerning\nbottles, as especially honest things (while bushels are to the\ncontrary), and the tendency of all Scripture is such--whichever\nTestament you take--that no man in his wits can doubt it. And though I\nnever read the Koran, and only have heard some verses of it, I know\nenough to say positively, that Mahomet began this movement to establish\nAntichrist.\n\nHowever, my groom said that Parson Chowne, though not such a fool as to\nstop other people, scarcely ever took a drop himself; and his main\ndelight was to make low beasts of the clergy who had no self-command.\nAnd two or three years ago he had played a trick on his brother parsons,\nsuch as no man would ever have tried who took his own glass in\nmoderation and enjoyed it heartily, as Scripture even commands us to do,\nto promote good-fellowship and discretion. Having a power of visitation,\nfrom some faculty he enjoyed, he sent all round to demand their presence\nat a certain time, for dinner. All the parsons were glad enough,\nespecially as their wives could not, in good manners, be invited,\nbecause there was now no Mrs Chowne. And they saw a rare chance to tell\ngood stories, and get on without the little snaps which are apt to occur\namong ladies. Therefore they all appeared in strength, having\nrepresented it as a high duty, whatever their better halves might think.\nWhen a parson says this, his wife must knock under, or never go to\nchurch again. Being there, they were treated well, and had the good\ndinner they all deserved, and found their host very different from what\nthey had been led to expect of him. He gave them as much wine as they\nneeded, and a very good wine too. He let them tell their stories, though\nhis own taste was quite different; and he even humoured them so as to\nlaugh the while he was despising them. And though he could not bear\ntobacco, that and pipes were brought in for them.\n\nAll went smoothly until one of them, edged on by the others, called for\nspirits and hot water. This Master Chowne had prepared for, of course,\nand meant to present the things in good time; but now being gored thus\nin his own house, the devil entered into him. His dark face grew of a\nleaden colour, while he begged their pardon. Then out he went to Mother\nSteelyard, and told her exactly what to do. Two great jacks of brown\nbrandy came in, and were placed upon the table, and two silver kettles\nupon the hobs. He begged all his guests to help themselves, showing the\nlemons and sugar-caddy, the bottles, and kettles, and everything: and\nthen he left them to their own devices, while he talked with Parson\nJack, who had dropped in suddenly.\n\nNow, what shall I tell you came to pass--as a very great traveller\nalways says--why, only that these parsons grew more drunk than despair,\nor even hope. Because, in the silver kettles was not water, but whisky\nat boiling-point, and the more they desired to weaken their brandy, the\nmore they fortified it: until they tumbled out altogether, in every\nstate of disorder. For this he had prepared, by placing at the foot of\nhis long steps half-a-dozen butts of liquid from the cleaning of his\ndrains, meant to be spread on the fields next day. And into the whole of\nthis they fell, and he bolted the doors upon them.\n\nThis made a stir in the clerical circles, when it came to be talked\nabout; but upon reference to the bishop, he thought they had better say\nnothing about it, only be more considerate. And on the whole it\nredounded greatly to the credit of Parson Chowne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nWAITING AND LEARNING.\n\n\nWhat this great man now said to me had better not be set down perhaps;\nbecause it proved him incapable of forming due estimate of my character.\nEnough that he caused me some alarm and considerable annoyance by his\nsupercilious vein, and assumption of evil motives. Whereas you could not\nfind anywhere purer or loftier reasons, and I might say, more poetical\nones, than those which had led me to abstain from speaking of the fair\nyoung lady. However, as this Chowne had learned all about her, from some\nskulking landsman, whom he maintained as a spy at the back of the\npremises, it was certain that I could in no way harm her, by earning a\ntrifle of money in front, in a thoroughly open and disciplined way. And\nit might even lie in my power thereby to defeat the devices of enemies,\nand rescue this beautiful young female from any one who would dare to\nthink of presuming to injure her.\n\nI found my breast and heart aglow with all the fine feeling of younger\ndays, the moment the above occurred to me; and it would not have cost me\ntwo blows to knock down any man who misunderstood me. However, his\nReverence did not afford me any chance for this exercise; but seemed to\nallow me the benefit which such ideas afford a man; and promised to\ngive me three half-crowns, instead of five shillings a week, as before.\n\nHe allowed me a hay-loft to sleep in that night, after taking good care\nthat I had not even a flint to strike a light with. For, cordially as he\ndid enjoy the firing of an enemy\'s barns or stacks, his Reverence never\ncould bear the idea of so much as a spark coming near his own. And the\nfollowing morning I saddled my horse, with a good chain undergirding,\nand taking turn and turn about, got home to the Rose of Devon.\n\nAnd here I found very unjust work, Fuzzy gone, and Ike not to be found,\nand the ketch laid up for the winter. Only Bang, the boy, was left, and\nthe purpose of his remaining was to bear me a wicked message. Namely,\nthat I had been so much away, both in the boat and on horseback, that\nthe captain would not be bound to me, except to get home again, how I\nmight. And if this could not be brought about, and I chose to take care\nof the ketch for the winter, two shillings a-week was what I might draw,\nalso the wood on the wharf, so long as it would last for firing; and any\nfish I could catch with lines; and any birds I could shoot on the river,\nwith a stone of rock-powder that was in the hold.\n\nBang was ashamed to deliver this message; and I cannot describe to you\nmy wrath, as slowly I wrung it out of him. His head went into his neck\nalmost, for fear of my taking it by the handles, which nature had\nprovided in his two ears, and letting him learn (as done once before)\nthat the mast had harder knots in it. But I always scorn injustice; and\nBang was not to be blamed for this. So I treated him kindly; as I might\nwish a boy of my own to be treated by a man of large experience. And I\nlet him go home to his mother\'s house, which was said to be somewhere\nwithin a league, and then I went to see what manners had been shown in\nthe pickling-tub.\n\nHere I found precious little indeed, and only the bottom stuff of\ncoxcombs, tails, and nails, and over-harpings, thready bits, and\ntapeworm stuff, such as we pray deliverance from, unless it comes to\nfamine. Nevertheless, in my now condition I grieved that there was not\nmore of it. Because how could I get across to my native land again? All\nthe small coasting-craft were laid up, as if they were china for\nshelfing, immediately after that gale of wind, which (but for me) must\nhave capsized us. These fellows up the rivers never get a breath of\nseamanship. Sudden squalls are all they think of. Sea room, and the\npower of it, they would be afraid of.\n\nAt one time I thought of walking home, because none of these traders\nwould venture it; and if I had only a guinea to start with on the road\nto Bristol, nothing could have stopped me. For, say what I might to\nmyself about it, and reason however carefully, I could not reconcile\nwith my conscience these things that detained me. The more I considered\nonly three half-crowns, and the mere chance of wild-ducks on the river,\nthe less I perceived how my duty lay, and the more it appeared to be\nmovable. And why was I bound to stop here like this, when their place\nwas to take me home again, according to stipulation? To apply to the\nmayor, as I knew, was useless, especially now that I owed him a bill; as\nfor the bench of magistrates, one had already a bias against me, because\nI went into a wood one night to watch an eclipse of the moon, and took\nmy telescope; which they all swore was a gun! Being disappointed with\nthe moon\'s proceedings, I slammed up my telescope hastily, and at the\nsame time puffed my pipe; and there was a fellow on watch so vile as to\nswear to the sound and the smoke of a gun! And this fellow proved to be\na Welshman of the name of Llewellyn, and a cousin of mine within seven\ngenerations! I acquit him of knowing this fact at the time; and when in\ncross-examination I let him know it, and nobody else, he came back to\nhis duty, and swore white all the black he had sworn before.\nNevertheless I did not like it (though acquitted amidst universal\napplause) on account of the notoriety; and finding him one night upon\nthe barge walk, and his manners irritating, I was enabled to impress him\nwith a sense of consanguinity. And after that I might bear my telescope,\nand take observations throughout the coverts, whenever the pheasants did\nnot disturb me.\n\nThis privilege, and a flight of wild-ducks, followed by a team of geese,\nand rumours even of two wild swans, moderated my desire to be back at\nhome again. There no man can get a shot, except in very bitter weather,\nor when the golden plovers come in, unless he likes to take on himself a\nstrong defiance of public opinion. Because Colonel Lougher is so kind,\nand so forbears to prosecute, that to shoot his game is no game at all,\nand shames almost any man afterwards. And the glory of all that\nnight-work is, the sense of wronging somebody.\n\nMoreover, a little thing occurred, which, in my doubt of conclusion, led\nme to stay a bit longer. Some people may think nothing of it, but a kind\ntouch takes a hold on me. I have spoken of a boy, by the name of Bang,\npossessing many good qualities, yet calling for education. Of this I\nhad given him some little, administered not to his head alone, but to\nmore influential quarters; and the result was a crop of gratitude\nwatered by humility. When he went home for the winter months, I expected\nto hear no more of him, having been served in that manner often by boys\nwhom I have corrected. Therefore all who have ever observed the want of\nthankfulness in the young, will enter into my feelings when an ancient\nwoman, Bang\'s grandmother, hailed me in a shaky voice over the side of\nmy ketch, with Bang in the distance watching her. Between her feet was a\ngood large basket, which with my usual fine feeling I leaped out to ease\nher of. But on no account would she let me touch it, until she knew more\nabout me.\n\n""Be you the man?"" she said.\n\n""Madam,"" I answered, ""I be the man.""\n\n""The man as goes on so wicked to Bang, for the sake of his soul\nhereafter?""\n\n""Yes, madam, I am he who clothed in the wholesome garb of severity a\ndeep and parental affection;"" for now I smelled something uncommonly\ngood.\n\n""Be you the chap as wolloped him?""\n\n""That I can proudly say I am.""\n\n""Look \'e see, here, this be for \'e, then!""\n\nWith no common self-approval, I observed what she turned out; although I\nlonged much to unpack them myself, for fear of her spoiling anything.\nBut she put me back in a wholesale manner, and spread it all out like a\nmarket-stand. And really it was almost enough to make a market of; for\nshe was a very wiry old woman, and Bang had helped carry, as far as the\nwharf, when he saw me, and fled. Especially did I admire a goose, fat\nwith golden fat upon him, trussed, and laid on stuffing-herbs. Also, a\nlittle pig for roasting, too young to object to it, yet with his\ncharacter formed enough to make his brains delicious. And as for\nsausages--but no more.\n\nThe goodness of these things preserved me from going off on the tramp\njust yet. That is the last thing a sailor should do, though gifted with\nan iron-tipped wooden leg. The Government drove me into it once, when my\nwound allowed me to be discharged; but it took more out of my\nself-respect than ever I have recovered. And if I do anything under the\nmark (which, to my knowledge, I never do), it dates from the time the\nKing drove me to alms. However, I never do dwell upon that, unless\nthere is something wrong down in my hold; and when that is right, I am\nthankful again. And none of that ever befalls me, when I get my rations\nregular. But who cares to hear any more about me, with all these great\nthings coming on? You may look on me now as nobody.\n\nBecause I fell so much beneath my own idea of myself, and all that\nothers said of me, through my nasty want of strength, when Parson Chowne\ncame over me. It is easy enough to understand that a man, in\ngood-nature, may knock under to another man of good-nature also; all in\nfriendship and in fun, and for the benefit of the world. But for a man\nof intellect not so very far under the average--as will now be admitted\nof me, in spite of all inborn diffidence--as well as a man of a\ncharacter formed and framed by experience, now to be boarded and\nviolently driven under hatches, without any power to strike a blow, by a\nman who was never on board of a ship--at any rate to my knowledge; to\nthink of this and yet not help it, made me chafe like a fellow in irons.\n\nThere was one thing, however, that helped to make me put up with my\npresent position a little, and that was my hope to be truly of service\nto my genuine benefactor, poor Sir Philip Bampfylde. This old gentleman\nclearly was not going on very comfortably; and Parson Chowne had given\nme to understand, without any words, that the great chest landed at the\nend of his house, was full of arms and all other treason. These were to\nbe smuggled in, after the Captain\'s departure; and the Captain would not\nenter the house, through fear of the servants suspecting something.\n\nI could not reconcile this account with what I had seen the young lady\ndo, and the Captain\'s mode of receiving it; but as I would not tell the\nParson a word about that young lady, I could not make that objection to\nhim. Nor did I say, though I might have done so, that I would not and\ncould not believe for a moment that any British naval captain would\nemploy his ship and crew for a purpose of high treason to his lawful\nmaster. That Parson Chowne should dare to think that I would swallow\nsuch stuff as that, made me angry with myself for not having\ncontradicted him. But all this time I was very wise, and had no call to\nreproach myself. Seldom need any man repent for not having said more\nthan he did; and never so needeth a Welshman.\n\nAnd now, though I still took observation of Narnton Court (as in honour\nbound to deserve my salary), and though the Parson still rode down, and\nwent the round of the deck at times when nobody could expect him; yet it\nwas not in my nature to be kept from asking something as to all these\npeople. You may frighten a man, and scare his wits, and keep him under,\nand trample on him, and even beat his feelers down, and shut him up like\na jellyfish; but, after all this, if he is a man, he will want to know\nthe reason. For this makes half of the difference between man and the\nlower animals:--the latter, when punished, accept it as a thing that\nmust befall them; and so do the negroes, and all proper women: but a man\nalways wants to know why it must be; though it greatly increases his\ntrouble to ask, and still more to tell it again, if you please.\n\nSir Philip Bampfylde, as every one said, was a very nice gentleman\nindeed, the head of an ancient family, and the owner of a large estate.\nKind, moreover, and affable, though perhaps a little stately, from\nhaving long held high command and important rank in the army. Some years\nago he had attained even to the rank of general, which is the same thing\namong land-forces as an admiral is with us; and he was so proud of this\nposition that he always wished to be so addressed, rather than by the\ntitle which had been so long in the family. For his argument was that he\nhad to thank good fortune for being a baronet, whereas good conduct and\nperseverance alone could have made him a general. Now if these had made\nhim an admiral, I would always entitle him so; as it is, I shall call\nhim ""Sir Philip,"" or ""General,"" just as may happen to come to my mind.\nNow this gentleman had two sons, and no other children; the elder was\nPhilip Bampfylde, Esquire, and the younger Captain Drake Bampfylde, of\nwhom I have spoken already. Philip, the heir, had been appointed to\nmanage the family property, which spread for miles and miles away; and\nthis gave him quite enough to do, because his father for years and years\nwas away on foreign service. And during this time Squire Philip married\na lady of great beauty, sent home by his father from foreign parts after\nrescue from captivity. She was of very good extraction, so far as\nforeigners can be, and a princess (they said) in her own right, though\nwithout much chance of getting it. And she spoke the prettiest broken\nEnglish, being very sensitive.\n\nWell, everything thus far went purely enough, and the lady had brought\nhim a pair of twins, and was giving good promise of going on, and\neverybody was pleased with her, and most of all her husband, and Sir\nPhilip was come home from governorship, but only on leave of absence,\nand they were trying hard to persuade him now to retire and live in\npeace, when who should come with his evil luck to spoil everything, but\nDrake Bampfylde? How it came to pass was not clearly known, at least to\nthe folk on our side of the river, or those whom I met in Barnstaple.\nAnd I durst not ask on the further side, that is to say around Narnton\nCourt, because the Parson\'s spies were there. Only the old women felt\npretty sure that they had heard say, though it might be wrong, that\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde had drowned the children, some said by accident,\nsome said on purpose, and buried them somewhere on Braunton Burrows. And\nthe effect of this on the foreign lady, being as she was, poor thing,\nmight have been foreseen almost. For she fell into untimely pains, and\nneither herself nor her babe survived, exactly as happened to my son\'s\nwife.\n\nThis was a very sad story, I thought, but they said that the worst of it\nstill lay behind: for poor Squire Philip had been so upset by the hurry\nof all these misfortunes, that nobody knew what to do with him. He\nalways had been a most warm-hearted man, foolishly fond of his wife and\nchildren, and of a soft and retiring nature. Moreover, he looked on his\nyounger brother, who had seen so much more of the world than himself,\nand was of a bolder character, not with an elder son\'s usual\ncarelessness, but with a thorough admiration. And when he found him\nbehave in this manner (according, at least, to what every one said), and\nall for the sake of the property, without a sharp word between them, it\nwent to his heart, in the thick of his losses, so that he was beside\nhimself. He let his beard grow and his hair turn white, although he was\nnot yet forty, and he put up the shutters of his room, and kept candles\naround him, and little dolls. He refused to see his brother Drake, and\nhis father Sir Philip, and everybody, except his own attendant, and the\nnurse of his poor children. And finding this, the Captain left the\nhouse, as if cursed out of it.\n\nThe only one who took things bravely was the ancient General. Much as he\ngrieved at the loss of his race, and extinction, perhaps, of the family,\nhe swore that he never would be cast down, or doubt the honour of his\nfavourite son, until that son confessed it. This Drake Bampfylde had\nnever done, although the case was hard against him, and scarcely any\none, except his father, now stood up for him. But of the few who still\nheld him guiltless, was one especial comforter: Isabel Carey to wit, a\nyoung lady of very good Devonshire family, left as a ward to Sir Philip\nBampfylde, and waiting for three or four years more of age, to come into\nlarge estates in South Devon.\n\nThe general people did not know this; but I happened to get ahead of\nthem; and having a knack in my quiet way of putting two and two\ntogether, also having seen the Captain, and shaped my opinions, I would\nhave staked my boat against a cuttle-fish that he was quite innocent. If\nthe children were found buried--although I could never quite get at\nthis, but only a story of a man who had seen him doing it, as I shall\ntell hereafter--but even supposing them deep in the sand (which I was a\nlittle inclined to do, from trusting my spy-glass so thoroughly), yet\nthere might have been other people quite as likely to put them there as\nthat unlucky Captain Drake.\n\nIt has been my lot to sail under a great many various captains, not only\nwhom I have hinted at in the days when I was too young for work, but\nwhom I mean to describe hereafter in my far greater experiences; really\nfinding (although I have tried to convince people to the contrary) that\nwhat they have told me was perfectly true, and that I come out far\nstronger and better whenever my reins are tried and proved; and my loins\nas sound as a bell, although hereditary from King David. Let that pass.\nI find one fault, and it is the only one to be found with me; it is that\nthe style of our bards will come out, and spread me abroad in their\nlofty allusions.\n\nTo come back to these captains. I never found one who would do such a\nthing as kill and slay two children, much less dig their graves in the\nsand, and come home to dinner afterwards. And of all the captains I had\nseen, Drake Bampfylde seemed as unfit as any to do a thing of that\ndirtiness. However, as I have not too much trust in human nature (after\nthe way it has used me, and worst of all when in the Government), I said\nto myself that it was important to know at what time this Captain\nBampfylde won the love of that fine Miss Carey. Because, after that, he\nhad no temptation to put the little ones out of the way; and I quite\nsettled it in my own mind, that if they had set up their horses\ntogether, before the young children went out of the world, Captain Drake\nBampfylde was not likely to have made them go so. For that fair maiden\'s\nestates, I was told, would feed four hundred people.\n\nNo one had seen this, exactly as I did, nor could I beat it into them;\nand I found from one or two symptoms that it was high time for me to\nleave off talking. Parson Chowne came down one night, as black as a\ntarred thunderbolt, and though he said nothing to let me know, I felt\nafraid of his meaning. Also Parson Jack rode down, in his headlong\ncareless way, and filled his pipe from my tobacco-bag, and gave me a\nwink, and said, ""Keep your mouth shut."" It was always a pleasure to me\nto behold him; whatever his principles may have been, and if I could\nhave said a word to stop him from his downward road, or to make it go\nless sudden, goodness knows I would have done it, at the risk of three\nhalf-crowns a-week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nTHE POLITE FERRYMAN.\n\n\nNow, for a man of my age and knowledge, keeping an eye on his own\nconcerns, and under the eyes of a good many women (eager to have him,\nbecause confessed superior to the neighbourhood, yet naturally doubtful\nhow much money would be wanted), for such a man to attend to things\nwhich could not concern him in any way, without neglecting what now he\nhad found a serious matter at his time of life--this, to my mind, proves\na breadth of sympathy rarely found outside of Wales.\n\nEntering into these things largely, and desiring to do my best, having,\nmoreover, nought else to do except among dabs and flounders, I was led\nby a naturally active mind to try to turn a penny; not for my own good\nso much as for the use of Bunny. Therefore, having the punt at command,\nand a good pair of oars, and a good pair of arms, what did I do but set\nup a ferry, such as had never been heard of before, and never might have\nbeen dreamed of, except for my intelligence? Because we had two miles to\nBarnstaple Bridge, and no bridge at all to be found below us, and a good\nmany houses here and there, on either side of the river. And I saw that\nthey must know one another, and were longing to dine or to gossip\ntogether, except for the water between them, or the distance to walk all\nthe way by the bridge. So being left in this desolate state, and\nshamefully treated by Captain Fuzzy, and Bang\'s grandmother now\nneglecting me, at a period of sadness, while smoking a pipe, Providence\ngave me this brilliant idea.\n\nI never had dreamed for a moment of settling without something\npermanent; and not even Â£30 a-year would tempt me to do any despite to\nmy late dear wife\'s remembrance. A year and a day at the very least was\nI resolved to mourn for her: still, as the time was drawing on, I\ndesired to have some prospect. Not to settle rashly, as young people do\nin such affairs (which really should be important), but to begin to feel\nabout, and put the price against the weight, and then take time to think\nabout it. Only I had made up my mind not to look twice at the very\nrichest and most beautiful Methodist. Enough had I had for my life of\nthem, and the fellows that come after them: Church of England, or Church\nof Rome, for me this time at any rate; with preference to the latter\nbecause having no chapel in our neighbourhood.\n\nAnd I worked this ferry, if you will believe me, not for the sake of the\ntwopence both ways, half so much as because of my thoughts of the\nconfidence that I must create. I knew for I won\'t say forty years, but\nat any rate good thirty, what women are the very moment they must needs\ncome into a boat. The very shyest and wisest of them are at the mercy of\na man right out. And I never could help believing that they come for\nthat very reason. I know all their queerness of placing their toes, and\nhow they fetch their figures up, and manage to hitch their petticoats,\nand try to suppose they are quite on a balance, and then go down plump\non the nearest thwart, and pretend that they did it on purpose.\nNevertheless they are very good; and we are bound to make the best of\nthem.\n\nWhen I told Parson Chowne of my ferry-boat, rather than let him find it\nout, which of course must have happened immediately, a quick gleam of\nwrath at my daring to do such a thing without consulting him moved in\nthe depth of his great black eyes. At least I believed so, but was not\nsure; for I never could bear to look straight at his eyes, as I do to\nall other people, especially Anthony Stew, Esquire. I thought that my\nferry would be forbidden; but with his usual quickness he saw that it\nmight serve his purpose in several ways. Because it would help to keep\nme there, as well as account for my being there, and afford me the best\nchance in the world of watching the river traffic. So he changed his\nfrown to an icy smile, such as I never could smile at, and said--\n\n""Behold now what good-luck comes of my service! Only remember, no fares\nto be taken when the tide serves for you know what. And especially no\ngossiping.""\n\nThis being settled to my content, I took a great peace of loose\ntarpaulin out of the hold of the Rose of Devon, and with a bucket of\nthick lime-whiting explained to the public in printing letters, each as\nlarge as a marlinspike, who I was, and of what vocation, and how\nthoroughly trustworthy. And let any one read it, and then give opinion\nin common fairness, whether any man capable of being considered a spy\nwould ever have done such a thing as this:--\n\n""David Llewellyn, Mariner of the Royal Navy, Ferryman to King George the\nIIId. Each way or both ways only Twopence. Ladies put carefully over the\nMud. Live Fish on hand at an hour\'s notice, and of the choicest\nQuality."" This last statement was not quite so accurate as I could have\ndesired. To oblige the public, I kept the fish too long on hand\noccasionally, because I never had proper notice when it might be wanted.\nAnd therefore no reasonable person ever took offence at me.\n\nOne fine day towards the frosty time, who should appear at my\nlanding-stage on the further side of the river, just by the lime-kiln\nnot far from the eastern end of Narnton Court--who but a beautiful young\nlady with her maid attending her? The tide was out, and I was crossing\nwith a good sixpennyworth, that being all that my boat would hold,\nunless it were of children. And seeing her there, I put on more speed,\nso as not to keep her waiting. When I had carried my young women over\nthe mud and received their twopences, I took off my hat to the fair\nyoung lady, who had kept in the background, and asked to what part I\nmight have the honour of conveying her ladyship.\n\n""I am not a ladyship,"" she answered, with a beautiful bright smile; ""I\nam only a common lady; and I think you must be an Irishman.""\n\nThis I never am pleased to hear, because those Irish are so untruthful;\nhowever, I made her another fine bow, and let her have her own way about\nit.\n\n""Then, Mr Irishman,"" she continued; ""you are so polite, we will cross\nthe water. No, no, thank you,"" as I offered to carry her; ""you may carry\nNanette, if she thinks proper. Nanette has the greatest objection to\nmud; but I am not quite so particular."" And she tripped with her little\nfeet over the bank too lightly to break the green cake of the ooze.\n\n""You sall elave me, my good man,"" said Nanette, who was rather a pretty\nFrench girl; ""Mamselle can afford to defigure her dress; but I can no\nsuch thing do at all.""\n\nMeanwhile the young lady was in the boat, sitting in the stern-sheets\nlike a lieutenant, and laughing merrily at Nanette, who was making the\nprettiest fuss in the world, not indeed with regard to her legs, which\nan English girl would have considered first, but as to her frills and\nfripperies; and smelling my quid, she had no more sense than to call me\na coachman, or something like it. However, I took little heed of her,\nalthough her figure was very good; for I knew that she could not have\nsixpence, and scarcely a hundred a-year would induce me to degrade\nmyself down to a real French wife. For how could I expect my son ever to\nbe a sailor?\n\nNow as I pulled, and this fine young lady, who clearly knew something\nabout a boat, nodded her head to keep time with me, and showed her white\nteeth as she smiled at herself, my own head was almost turned, I\ndeclare; and I must have blushed, if it could have been that twenty\nyears of the fish-trade had left that power in me. Because this young\nlady was so exactly what my highest dreams of a female are, and never\nyet realised in my own scope. And her knowledge of a boat, and courage,\nand pleasant contempt of that French chit who had dared to call me a\n""coachman,"" when added to her way of looking over the water with fine\nfeeling (such as I very often have, and must have shown it long ago),\nalso the whole of this combined with a hat of a very fine texture\nindeed, such as I knew for Italian, and a feather that curled over\ngolden pennon of hair in the wind like a Spanish ensign; and not only\nthese things, but a face, and manner, and genuine beauty of speech, not\nto be found in a million of women,--after dwelling on all these things\nboth steadily and soberly, over my last drop of grog, before I went into\nmy berth that night, and prayed for the sins of the day to go upward,\nwhat do you think I said on the half-deck, and with all the stars\nobserving me--""I\'m damned if I\'ll serve Parson Chowne any more."" I said\nit, and I swore it.\n\nAnd when I came to think of it, in a practical manner, next morning, and\nto balance the ins and outs, and what I might come to, if thus led\nastray, by a man in holy orders (yet whose orders were all unholy, at\nany rate, such as he gave to me), and when I reflected on three\nhalf-crowns for finding me in everything, and then remembered how I had\nturned two guineas in a day, when poor Bardie came to me, and with a\nconscience as clear as a spent cuttle-fish; and never a sign of my heels\nbehind me, when squeamish customers sat down to dinner; also good\nMother Jones with sweet gossip, while my bit of flesh was grilling, and\nmy little nip of rum, and the sound of Bunny snoring, while I smoked a\npipe and praised myself; also the pleasure of doubting whether they\ncould do without me at the ""Jolly"" through the wall, and the certain\nknowledge how the whole of the room would meet me, if I could deny\nmyself enough to go among them;--these things made me lose myself, as in\nthis sentence I have done, in longing to find old times and places, and\nold faces, once again, and some one to call me ""Old Dyo.""\n\nNow who would believe that the whole of all this was wrought in my not\nvery foolish mind, by the sight of a beautiful high-bred face, and the\nsound of a very sweet softening voice? Also the elegant manner in which\nshe never asked what the passage would come to, but gave me a bright and\ntrue half-crown for herself and that frippery French girl. I must be a\nfool; no doubt I am, when the spirit of ancestors springs within me,\nspoiling all trade; as an inborn hiccough ruins the best pipe that ever\nwas filled. For though I owed three tidy bills, I had no comfort until I\ndrilled a little hole in that bright half-crown, and hung it with my\ncharms and knobs and caul inside my Jersey. And thus the result became\npermanent, and my happiness was in my heart again, and all my\nself-respect leaped up as ready to fight as it ever had been, when I had\nshaped a firm resolve to shake off Chowne, like the devil himself.\n\nI cannot imagine a lower thing than for any man to say--and some were\neven to that degree base--that I thus resolved upon calculation, and\nability now to get on without him, and balance of his three half-crowns\nagainst the income of my ferry, with which I admit that his work\ninterfered. Neither would any but a very vile man dare to cast\nreflections upon me, for having created by skill and eloquence a small\nsnug trade in the way of fish, and of those birds which are sent by the\nLord in a casual way, and without any ownership, for the good of us\nunestated folk. While I deny as unequivocally as if upon oath before\nmagistrates, that more than fifty hares and pheasants--but there! I may\ngo on for ever rebutting those endless charges and calumnies, which the\nmere force of my innocent candour seems to strike out of maliciousness.\nOnce for all, I never poach, I never stab salmon, I never smuggle, I\nnever steal boats, I never sell fish with any stink outside of it,--and\nhow can I tell what it does inside, or what it may do afterwards? I\nnever tell lies to anybody who does not downright call for it; and you\nmay go miles and miles, I am sure, to find a more thoroughly honourable,\ngood-hearted, brave, and agreeable man.\n\nNow I did not mean to say any of this, when I began about it; neither am\nI in the habit of deigning even to clear myself; but once beginning with\nan explanation, I found it the best to start clear again; because Parson\nChowne, and my manner towards him (which for the life of me I could not\nhelp), also my service under him, and visit at his house, and so on, and\neven my liking for Parson Jack (after his sale to Satan, though managed\nwithout his privity), as well as my being had up for shooting pheasants\nwith a telescope;--these and many other things, too small now to dwell\nupon, may have spread a cloud betwixt my poor self and my readers; and a\ncloud whose belly is a gale of wind.\n\nIt is not that I ever could do any unworthy action. It is simply that I\ncan conceive the possibility of it seeming so to those who have never\nmet me; and who from my over-candid account (purposely shaped dead\nagainst myself) may be at a loss to enter into the delicacies of my\nconduct. But you shall see by-and-by; and seeing is believing.\n\nNow it was a lucky thing, that on the very morning after I had made my\nmind up so, and before it was altered much, down came Chowne in a\ntearing mood, with his beautiful black mare all in a lather. I was on\nboard of the Rose of Devon, smoking my first after-breakfast pipe, and\ncounting my cash from the ferry business of the day before--except, of\ncourse, the half-crown which lay among my charms, and strengthened me.\nThe ketch was aground in a cradle of sand, which she had long ago\nscooped for herself, and which she seldom got out of now, except just to\nfloat at the top of the springs. She stood almost on an even keel,\nunless it were blowing heavily. Our punt (or rather I should call her\nmine by this time, for of course she most justly belonged to me, after\nall their breach of contract, and desertion of their colours)--at any\nrate, there she was afloat and ready for any passenger, while my notice\nto the public flapped below the mainboom of the ketch.\n\n""You precious rascal,"" cried Chowne, from the wharf, with his horse\nstaring at the tarpaulin, and half inclined to shy from it; ""who was it\ncrossed the river twice in your rotten ferry-boat yesterday?""\n\n""Please your Reverence,"" I answered, calmly puffing at my pipe, which I\nknew would still more infuriate him: ""will your Reverence give me time\nto think? Let me see--why, let me see--there was Mother Pugsley from up\nthe hill, and Mother Bidgood from round the corner, and Farmer Skinner,\nand young Joe Thorne, and Eliza Tucker from the mill, and Jenny\nStribling, and Honor Jose, first cousin to our captain, and--well I\nthink that\'s nearly all that I know the name of, your Reverence.""\n\n""I thought you knew me better now than to lie to me, Llewellyn. You know\nwhat I mean as well as I do.""\n\n""To be sure, to be sure, your Reverence; I beg your pardon altogether. I\nought to have remembered poor old Nanny Gotobed.""\n\nThe wharf was high, and our gunwale below it; he put his mare at it,\nclapped in the spurs, and before I could think or even wonder, he had me\nby the nape of the neck, with his knuckles grinding into me, and his\nface, now ashy white with rage, fixed on me, so that I could not move.\n\n""Will you tell me?"" he cried.\n\n""I won\'t,"" said I; crack came his hunting-whip round my sides--crack,\nand wish, and crack again; then I caught up a broken spar, and struck\nhim senseless over the tail of his horse. The mare ramped all round the\nhalf-deck mad, then leaped ashore, with her legs all bloody, and scoured\naway with her saddle off.\n\nChowne lay so long insensible, that a cold sweat broke through the heat\nof my wrath, to think that I had killed him. And but for his hat, I had\ndone no less, for I struck with the strength of a maddened man, and the\nspar was of heavy Dantzic. I untied his neckcloth, and ran for water,\nand propped him up, and bathed his forehead, although my hands were\ntrembling so that I could scarcely hold the swab. And now as I watched\nhis pale stern face without a weak line in it even from fainting, I was\namazed at having ever dared to lift hand against him. But what Royal\nNavyman could ever put up with horsewhip?\n\nAt last he fetched a strong breath, and opened the usual wickedness of\nhis eyes, and knew me at once, but did not know exactly what had\nbefallen him. I have had a good deal to do with knocking down a good\nmany men, and know that such is their usual practice; and that if you\ntake them promptly then, they will sometimes believe things very freely.\nTherefore I said, ""Your Reverence has contrived to hit yourself very\nhard, but I hope you will soon be better again.""\n\n""Hit myself! Why, somebody hit me!"" and then he went off again into a\ndoze, from the buzzing of his head perhaps Perceiving that he would\nsoon come to himself, and desiring to be acquitted of any violent charge\nof battery, I jumped down into the hold and fetched an old boom that was\nlying there, and hoisted it up in the tackle-fall, so as to hang at\nabout the right height. Moreover, I put the spar well away; and then,\nwith a sluice of water, I fetched his Reverence back to himself again. I\nfound him very correct this time, and beginning to look about pretty\nbriskly, therefore I turned him away and said, ""Your Reverence must not\nlook at it--it will make your head go round again; either shut your eyes\nor look away, your Worship.""\n\nHe seemed not to notice me, so I went on, ""Your Reverence has had a\nnarrow escape. What a mercy your head is not broken! Your Reverence went\nto chastise me, and lo! your horse reared and threw your Reverence\nagainst that great boom which that lubberly Jose has left there ever\nsince we broke cargo.""\n\n""You are a liar,"" he said; ""you struck me. To the last day of your life\nyou shall rue it.""\n\nThe voice of his throat ran cold all through me, being so low and so\ncold itself; and the strength of his eyes was coming back, and the\nbitter disdain of his countenance. The devil, who wanted him for a rare\nmorsel in the way of cannibalism, stood at my elbow; but luckily thought\nit sweeter not to hurry it. The foulest man on all God\'s earth, who made\na scoff of mercy\'s self, lay at my mercy for a minute, defied it, took\nit, and hated it. For the sake of myself, I let him go. For the sake of\nmankind, I should have slain him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nUNDER FAIRER AUSPICES.\n\n\nKnowing now what I had to expect from Parson Chowne and from all his\ntrain (whether clothed or naked), and even perhaps from Parson Jack, who\nlay beneath his thumb so much, and who could thrash me properly; I\nseized the chance of a good high tide, and gave a man sixpence to help\nme, and warped the Rose of Devon to a berth where she could float and\nswing, and nobody come a-nigh her without a boat or a swimming-bout.\nBecause I knew from so many folk what a fiend I had to deal with, and\nthat his first resort for vengeance (haply through his origin) generally\nwas to fire. They told me that when he condescended to do duty in either\nchurch--for two he had, as I may have said--all the farmers took it for\na call to have their ricks burned. They durst not stay away from church,\nto save the very lives of them, nor could they leave their wives behind,\non account of the unclothed people: all they could hope was that no\noffence had come from their premises, since last service. The service he\nheld just as suited his mood; sometimes three months, and the\nchurch-door locked; sometimes three Sundays one after the other, man,\nwoman, and child demanded. Whenever this happened, the congregation knew\nthat the parish had displeased him, and that he wanted them all in\nchurch; while his boy was at the stackyards. He never deigned to preach,\nbut made the prayers themselves a comedy, singing them up to the clerk\'s\n""amen,"" and the neigh of his mare from the vestry.\n\nI cannot believe even half that I hear from the very best authority;\ntherefore I set nothing down which may be overcoloured. But the\nfollowing story I know to be true, because seven people have told it to\nme, and not any two very different. Two or three bishops and archdeacons\n(or deacons of arches, I know not which, at any rate high free-masons)\ndesired to know some little more about a man in their jurisdiction\neminent to that extent, and equally notorious. They meant no harm at\nall, but just to take a little feel of him. Because he had come to\nvisitation, once or twice when summoned, with his huntsman and his\nhounds, and himself in leathern breeches. There must have been something\namiss in this, or at any rate they thought so; and his lordship, a\nbishop just appointed, made up his mind to tackle him. He came in a\ncoach-and-four, and wearing all his high canonicals, and they managed\nsomehow to get up the hill, and appear at Nympton Rectory. Then a\nfootman struck the door with a gold stick well embossed; and he struck\nagain, and he struck again, more in dudgeon every time.\n\nBecause no man had yet been seen, nor woman on the premises; only dogs\nvery wild and mad, but kept away from biting. ""Strike again,"" said his\nlordship, nodding under his wig, with some courtesy; ""we must never be\nimpatient. Jemmy, strike again, my lad."" Jemmy struck a thundering\nstroke, and out came Mrs Steelyard. She looked at them all, and then she\nsaid, with her eyes full on the Bishop\'s, ""Are you robbers, or are you\nsavages? My master in that state and you do this!"" And they all saw that\nshe could not weep, by reason of too much sorrow. ""It is the Lord\nBishop,"" said the footman, keeping a little away from her. ""Excellent\nfemale,"" began his Lordship, spreading his hands in a habit learned\naccording to his duties, ""tell your master that his[C] Jehoshaphat wishes\nto see him."" ""Mr Jehoshaphat,"" she replied, ""you are just in time, and\nno more, sir. How we have longed for a minister! You are just in time\nand no more, sir. Will you have the kindness to come this way, and to\nstep as quietly as you can?"" His Lordship liked not the look of this;\nbeing, however, a resolute man, he followed the stony woman up the\nstaircase, and into a bedroom with the window-curtains three quarters\ndrawn. And here he found a pastille burning, and a lot of medicine\nbottles, and a Bible on the table open, and on it a pair of spectacles.\nIn the bed lay some one, with a face of fire heavily blotched with bungs\nof black, and all his body tossing with spasms and weak groaning. ""What\nmeans this?"" asked his Lordship, drawing considerably nearer to the\ndoor. ""Only the[D] plague,"" said the stony woman; ""he was took with it\nyesterday; doctor says he may last two hours more almost, particular if\nhe can get anybody to take the symptoms off him. I expect to be down\nwith it some time to-night, because I feel the tingling. But your\nHighness will stop and help us."" ""I am damned if I will,"" cried the\nBishop, sinking both manners and dignity in the violence of alarm; and\nhe ran down the stairs at such a pace that his apron strings burst, and\nhe left it behind, and he jumped into the coach with his two feet\nforemost, and slammed up the windows, and ordered full speed. Then\nParson Chowne rose, and threw off his mask, and drew back the\nwindow-curtain, and sat in his hunting-clothes, and watched with his\nusual bitter smile the rapid departure of his foe. And he had the\nBishop\'s apron framed, and hung it in the parsonage hall, from a\nred-deer\'s antlers, with the name and date below. And so of that Bishop\nhe heard no more.\n\nNow a man who had beaten three bishops, and all the archdeacons in the\ncountry, was of course tenfold of a match for me; and when he rode down\nsmoothly to me, as he did in a few days\' time, and never touched on our\nlittle skirmish, except with a sort of playful hit (so far as his\nhaughty mind could play), and riding another horse without a word about\nthe mischief which his favourite mare had taken, and demanded, as a\nmatter of justice, that having quitted his service now, I should pay\nback seven-and-sixpence drawn in advance for wages, I was obliged to\ntouch my hat, as if I had never made stroke at his, or put my knee upon\nhim. He had flogged me to such purpose that I ever must admire him; for\nthe flick of the boatswain\'s lash was a tickle compared to what Chowne\ntook out of me; and if I must tell the whole truth, I was prouder of\nhaving knocked down such a wonderful man than of all of my victories put\ntogether. But one of my weak and unreasonable views of life is this,\nthat having thrashed a man, I feel a great power of goodwill to him, and\na desire to give him quarter, and the more so the less he cries for it.\n\nBut, on the whole, I was not so young after all that was said by\neverybody, as to imagine for a moment that I had felt the last of him.\nThe very highest in the land had been compelled to yield to him: as when\nhe turned out my Lord G----\'s horses from the stabling ordered at Lord\nG----\'s inn. Would such a man accept defeat from a crazy old mariner\nlike me? Feeling my danger, and meaning never to knock under any more, I\nrefused, as a matter of principle, to restore so much as a halfpenny;\nand if I understand law at all, he was bound to give me another week\'s\nwages, in default of notice. However, I could not get it; and therefore\nam glad to quit such trifles.\n\nFrom all experience it was known that this man never hurried vengeance.\nHe knew that he was sure to get it; and he liked to dwell upon it, thus\nprolonging his enjoyment by the means of hope. He loved, as in the case\nof that unfortunate Captain Vellacott, to persuade his enemies that he\nhad forgiven, or at least forgotten them, and then to surprise them, and\nlaugh to himself at their ignorance of his nature. So I felt pretty sure\nthat I had some time till my life would be in danger. For, of course, he\nknew that my ferry business, growing in profit daily, would keep me\nwithin his reach for the present, over and above the difficulty of\ngetting across the Channel now. However, he began upon me sooner than I\nexpected, on account, perhaps, of my low degree.\n\nBut in the meanwhile, feeling sure that I could not stand worse with him\nthan I did--desiring, moreover, to ease my conscience, and perhaps\nimprove my income, by an act of justice--I crossed the river to Narnton\nCourt, and getting among the servants nicely, sent word in to Miss\nIsabel Carey that the old ferryman begged leave to see her upon business\nmost particular. For, of course (although, in the hurry of things, I\nmay have forgotten to mention it), the lovely young lady I ferried\nacross, and whose name I was thrashed so for not betraying, was Captain\nDrake\'s sweetheart, the ward of Sir Philip.\n\nOne of the most hateful things in Chowne was, that he never did anything\nin the good old-fashioned manner, unless it were use of the horsewhip.\nAnd it now rejoiced my heart almost to be shown into a fine dark room,\nby the side of good long passages, with a footman going before me, and\nshowing legs of a quite superior order, and then under my instructions\nboldly throwing an oaken door wide, and announcing, ""Mr David Llewellyn,\nma\'am!""\n\nFor though I had left Felix Farley behind, from a sort of romantic\nbashfulness, I had seen in the hall a coloured gentleman, who seemed\njustly popular; therefore I had just dropped a hint (not meant to go any\nfurther) concerning my risk of life and fortitude for the sake of black\nmen. And this made the women admire me, for it turned out that this\nworthy negro stood high in the house, and had saved some cash. The room\nwhich I entered was large and high, with an amazing number of books in\nit, and smelling exceeding learned. And there in a deep window sat the\nyoung lady, with the light from the river glancing on the bright\nelegance of her hair. And when she rose and came towards me, I felt\nuncommonly proud of having been even thrashed for her sake: nor did I\nwonder at Captain Drake\'s warm manner of proceeding, or at Chowne\'s\nresolve to keep so jealous a watch over her. Over and above her beauty,\nwhich was no business of mine, of course, she had such pretty eyebrows\nand so sweet a way of looking, that a thrill went to my experienced\nheart, in spite of all experience; and women seemed a different thing\nfrom what I was accustomed to.\n\nTherefore I left her to begin; while I made bows, and felt afraid of\ngiving offence by gazing. She, however, put me at my ease almost\ndirectly, having such a high-bred way, so clarified and gentle, that I\nneither could be distant nor familiar with her. Only to be quite at\nease, like, respect, and love her. And this lady was only about\nseventeen! It is wonderful how they learn so much.\n\nI need not follow all I said, or even what she said to me. Without for a\nmoment sacrificing my true sense of dignity, I gave her to understand,\nvery mildly, that I had seen something, and had taken a vague sense of\nits import, when I chanced to be after wild-ducks. Also that strong\nattempts had been made to set me spying after her, and that I might have\nyielded to them, but for my own lofty sense of being a victorious\nveteran, and the way in which I was conquered by her extraordinary\nbeauty.\n\nShe seemed for a moment to doubt how far I should have touched that\nsubject; and if I had only looked up she would have rung the bell\ndecidedly. But I bowed, and kept down my eyelashes; which were grey now,\nand helped me much in paying innocent compliments to every kind of\nwoman. Even in the bar of very first-rate public-houses have I been\npressed to take, and not pay for, glasses even of ancient stingo,\nbecause of the way I have paid respects, and looked through my shadows\nafterwards. Therefore this young lady said, ""I hardly know what to do or\nsay. Mr Llewellyn, it is a strange tale. Why should any one watch me?""\n\n""That is more than I can say, my lady. I only know that the thing is\ndone, and by a very wicked man indeed.""\n\n""And you have found it out, as ferryman? How clever of you, to be sure!\nAnd how honest to come and tell me! You have been a royal sailor?""\n\n""In the Royal Navy, ma\'am! Our captains are the most noble men, so\nbrave, and glorious, and handsome! If you could only see one of them!""\n\n""Perhaps I have,"" she said, under her breath, being carried away by my\ndescription, as I hoped to do to her; and then she came back through a\nshading of colours to herself, and looked at me, as if to say, ""Have you\ndetected me now?"" I touched my lock; and by no means seemed to have\ndreamed a suspicion of anything.\n\n""You are a most worthy man,"" she said; ""and wonderfully straightforward.\nNone but a Royal Navy sailor could have behaved so nobly. In spite of\nall the bribes offered you----""\n\n""No, no, no!"" I cried; ""nothing to speak of! nothing to speak of! What\nis a guinea and a half a-week when it touches a man\'s integrity?""\n\n""Three guineas a-week you shall have at once; because you have behaved\nso nobly, and because you have fought for your country so, and been left\nwith nothing (I think you said), with half of your lungs quite shot\naway, except twopence a-day to live upon!""\n\n""One and eightpence farthing a-week, my lady; and to be signed by a\nclergyman; and twenty-eight miles to walk for it.""\n\n""It vexes mo so to hear such things. Don\'t tell me any more of it. What\nis the use of having money except for the people who want it? Mr\nLlewellyn, you must try not to be offended.""\n\nI saw that there was something coming, but looked very grave about it. A\nman of my rank and mark must never be at all ready, and much less eager,\nto lay himself under any form of trifling obligation. And thoroughly as\nshe had won me over, I tried very hard not to be offended, while she was\ngoing to a small black desk. If she had come thence with a guinea or\ntwo, my mind was made up to do nothing more than gracefully wave it back\nagain, and show myself hurt at such ignorance of me. But now when she\ncame with a Â£5 note (such as Sir Philip seemed to keep in stock), my\nduty to Bardie and Bunny rose as upright as could be before my eyes, and\noverpowered all selfish niceties. I would not make a fuss about it, lest\nI might hurt her feelings, but placed it in my pocket with a bow of\nsilent gratitude. Perhaps my face conveyed to her that it was not the\nmoney I cared for; only to do what was just and right, as any British\nsailor must when delicately handled. Also her confidence in me was so\nthoroughly sweet and delicate, that I felt the whole of my heart wrapped\nup in saving her from her enemies. We made no arrangements about it; but\nI went into her service bodily, being left to my own discretion, as\nseemed due to my skill and experience. I was to keep the ferry going,\nbecause of the opportunities, as well as to lull suspicion, and always\nat dark I was bound to be (according to my own proposal) near the river\nfront of the house, to watch against all wicked treachery. And\nespecially if a spy of Chowne\'s should come sneaking and skulking there,\nwhether in a boat or out of it, I gladly volunteered to thrash him\nwithin an inch of his foul base life. The bad man\'s name never passed\nbetween us; and indeed I may say that the lady forbore from committing\nherself against anybody, so that I was surprised to find such wit in one\nso youthful.\n\nWe settled between us that my duties were to begin that very day, and my\nsalary of course to run, also how the lady was to let me know when\nwanted, and I to tell her when I discovered anything suspicious. And as\nI had been compelled to restore the Parson\'s gun to his gunmaker, Miss\nCarey led me to a place you might almost call an armoury, and bade me\nchoose any piece I liked, and her own maid should place it where I could\nfind it that same evening, as though it were to shoot wild-fowl for\nthem. But she advised me on no account to have any talk with Nanette, or\nany servants of the household, whether male or female, not only because\nof the wicked reports and cruel slanders prevailing, but also that it\nmight not be known how I was to act in her interest. And then having\nordered me a good hot dinner in the butler\'s pantry, as often was done\nfor poor people, she let me go once, and then called me back, and said,\n""Oh, nothing;"" and then called me again, and said, looking steadily out\nof the window, ""By the by, I have quite forgotten to say that there is a\nboat belonging to a ship commanded by a son of Sir Philip Bampfylde, a\nwhite boat, with three oars on each side, and sometimes an officer\nbehind them. If they should happen to come up the river, or to go ashore\nupon business here, you need not--I mean, you will quite understand that\nno harm whatever is intended to me, and therefore that you may--you see\nwhat I mean.""\n\n""To be sure, to be sure, my lady. Of course I may quit my duty so long\nas there is a man-of-war\'s boat in the river; even the boldest and worst\nof men would venture nothing against you then.""\n\n""Quite so,"" she replied, looking bravely round, with as much of pride in\nher bright blue eyes as of colour on her soft fresh cheeks. So I made my\nbest bow and departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nTWO POOR CHILDREN.\n\n\nBy this time I owe it to all the kind people who have felt some pity for\nour Bardie and her fortunes, to put off no longer a few little things\nwhich I ought to tell them. In the first place, they must not think of\nme, but look upon me as nobody (treat me, in fact, as I treat myself),\nand never ask what I knew just now, and what I came to know afterwards.\nOnly to trust me (as now they must) to act in all things honourably, and\nwith no regard to self; and not only that, but with lofty feeling, and a\nsense of devotion towards the members of the weaker sex.\n\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde was the most unlucky of born mortals. To begin\nwith, he was the younger son of that very fine Sir Philip, and feeling\nthat he had far more wit and enterprise than his elder brother, while\nthankful to nature for these endowments, he needs must feel amiss with\nher for having mismanaged his time of birth. Now please to observe my\nform of words. I never said that he did so feel, I only say that he must\nhave done so, unless she had made him beyond herself; which, from her\nlove for us, she hardly ever tries to do. However, he might have put up\nwith that mistake of the goddess that sits cross-legged,--I have heard\nof her, I can tell you, and a ship named after her; though to spell her\nname would be a travail to me, fatal perhaps at my time of life,--I mean\nto say, at any rate, that young Drake Bampfylde might have managed to\nget over the things against him, and to be a happy fellow, if he only\nhad common luck. But Providence having gifted him with unusual\nadvantages of body, and mind, and so forth, seemed to think its duty\ndone, and to leave him to the devil afterwards.\n\nThis is a bad way of beginning life, especially at too young an age to\nbe up to its philosophy; and the only thing that can save such a man is\na tremendous illness, or the downright love of a first-rate woman.\nThence they recover confidence, or are brought into humility, and get a\nbit of faith again, as well as being looked after purely, and finding a\nvalue again to fight for, after abandoning their own. Not that Drake\nBampfylde ever did slip into evil courses, so far as I could hear of\nhim, or even give way to the sense of luck, and abandon that of duty. I\nam only saying how things turn out, with nineteen men out of twenty. In\nspite of chances, he may have happened just to be the twentieth. I know\nfor sure that he turned up well, though vexed with tribulation. Evil\ntimes began upon him, when he was nothing but a boy. He fell into a pit\nof trouble through his education; and ever since from time to time new\ngrief had overtaken him. A merrier little chap, or one more glad to make\nthe best of things, could not be found; as was said to me by the cook,\nand also the parlour-maid. He would do things, when he came out among\nthe servants, beautifully; and the maids used to kiss him so that his\nbreath was taken away with pleasing them. And then he went to school,\nand all the maids, and boys, and men almost, came out to see the yellow\ncoach, and throw an old shoe after him. This, however, did not help him,\nas was seriously hoped; and why? Because it went heel-foremost, from the\nstupidity of the caster. News came, in a little time, that there was\nmischief upward, and that Master Drake must be fetched home, to give\nany kind of content again. For he was at an ancient grammar-school in a\ntown seven miles from Exeter, where everything was done truly well to\nkeep the boys from fighting. Only the habit and tradition was that if\nthey must fight, fight they should until one fell down, and could not\ncome to the scratch again. And Drake had a boy of equal spirit with his\nown to contend against, not however of bone and muscle to support him\nthoroughly. But who could grieve, or feel it half so much as young Drake\nBampfylde did, when the other boy, in three days\' time, died from a\nbuzzing upon his brain? He might have got into mischief now, even though\nhe was of far higher family than the boy who had foundered instead of\nstriking; but chiefly for the goodwill of the school, and by reason of\nthe boy\'s father having plenty of children still to feed, and consenting\nto accept aid therein, that little matter came to be settled among them\nvery pleasantly. Only the course of young Drake\'s life was changed\nthereby, as follows.\n\nThe plan of his family had been to let him get plenty of learning at\nschool, and then go to Oxford Colleges and lay in more, if agreeable;\nand so grow into holy orders of the Church of England, well worth the\nwhile of any man who has a good connection. But now it was seen, without\nthinking twice, that all the disturbers and blasphemers of the\nNonconformist tribe, now arising everywhere (as in dirty Hezekiah, and\nthat greasy Hepzibah, who dared to dream such wickedness concerning even\nme), every one of these rogues was sure to cast it up against a parson,\nin his most heavenly stroke of preaching, that he must hold his hand,\nfor fear of killing the clerk beneath him. And so poor Drake was sent to\nsea; the place for all the scape-goats.\n\nHere ill fortune dogged him still, as its manner always is, after\ngetting taste of us. He heeded his business so closely that he tumbled\ninto the sea itself; and one of those brindle-bellied sharks took a\nmouthful out of him. Nevertheless he got over that, and fell into worse\ntrouble. To wit, in a very noble fight between his Britannic Majesty\'s\nsloop of war ""Hellgoblins,"" carrying twelve guns and two carronades\n(which came after my young time), and the French corvette ""Heloise,"" of\nsix-and twenty heavy guns, he put himself so forward that they trained\nevery gun upon him. Of course those fellows can never shoot anything\nunder the height of the moon, because they never stop to think;\nnevertheless he contrived to take considerable disadvantage. By a\nrandom shot they carried off the whole of one side of his whiskers; and\nthe hearing of the other ear fell off, though not involved in it. The\ndoctors could not make it out: however, I could thoroughly, from long\nacquaintance with cannon-balls. Also he had marks of powder under his\nskin, that would never come out, being of a coarse-grained sort, and\nsomething like the bits of tea that float in rich folks\' tea-cups.\nHappening, as he did by nature, to be a fine, florid, and handsome man,\nthis powder vexed him dreadfully. Nevertheless the ladies said, loving\npowder of their own, that it made him look so much nicer.\n\nThat, however, was quite a trifle, when compared to his next misfortune.\nBeing gazetted to a ship, and the whole crew proud to sail under him, he\nleft the Downs with the wind abaft, and all hands in high spirits. There\nwas nothing those lads could not have done; and in less than twelve\nhours they could do nothing. A terrible gale from south-west arose; in\nspite of utmost seamanship they were caught in the callipers of the\nVarne, and not a score left to tell of it.\n\nThese were things to try a man, and prove the stuff inside him. However,\nhe came out gallantly. For being set afloat again, after swimming all\nnight and half a day, he brought into the Portland Roads a Crappo ship\nof twice his tonnage, and three times his gunnage; and now his sailors\nwere delighted, having hope of prize-money. That they never got, of\ncourse (which, no doubt, was all the better for their constitutions),\nbut their knowledge of battle led them to embark again with him, having\nsense (as we always have) of luck, and a crooked love of a man whose bad\nluck seems to have taken the turn. And yet their judgment was quite\namiss, and any turn taken was all for the worse. Captain Bampfylde did a\nthing, which even I, in my hotter days, would rather have avoided. He\nran a thirty-two gun frigate under the chains of a sixty-four. He\nthought that they must shoot over him, while he laid his muzzles to her\nwater-line, and then carried her by boarding.\n\nNothing could have been finer than this idea of doing it, and with eight\nFrench ships out of nine, almost, he must have succeeded. But once more\nhis luck came over, like a cloud, and darkened him. The Frenchmen had\nnot only courage (which they have too much of), but also what is not\ntheir gift, with lucky people against them, self-command and steadiness.\nThey closed their lower ports, and waited for the Englishmen to come\nup. They knew that the side of their ship fell in, like the thatch of a\nrick, from the lower ports, ten feet above the enemy. They had their\nnettings ready, and a lively sea was running.\n\nIt grieves as well as misbecomes me to describe the rest of it. The\nEnglishmen swore with all their hearts at their ladders, the sea, and\neverything, and their captain was cast down between the two ships, and\ncompelled to dive tremendously; in a word it came to this, that our\npeople either were totally shot and drowned, or spent the next Sunday in\nprison at Brest.\n\nNow here was a thing for a British captain, such as the possibility of\nit never could be dreamed of. To have lost one ship upon a French shoal,\nand the other to a Frenchman! Drake Bampfylde, but for inborn courage,\nmust have hanged himself outright. And, as it was, he could not keep\nfrom unaccustomed melancholy. And, when he came home upon exchange, it\nwas no less than his duty to abandon pleasure now, and cheerfulness, and\ncomfort; only to consider how he might redeem his honour.\n\nIn the thick of this great trouble came another three times worse. I\nknow not how I could have borne it, if it had been my case, stoutly as I\nfight against the public\'s rash opinions. For this Captain was believed,\nand with a deal of evidence, to have committed slaughter upon his\nbrother\'s children, and even to have buried them. He found it out of his\npower to prove that really he had not done it, nor had even entertained\na wish that it might happen so. Everybody thought how much their dying\nmust avail him; and though all had a good idea of his being upright,\nmost of them felt that this was nothing, in such strong temptation. I\nhave spoken of this before, and may be obliged again to speak of it;\nonly I have rebutted always, and ever shall rebut, low ideas. Yet if\ntruly he did kill them, was he to be blamed or praised, for giving them\ngood burial? The testimony upon this point was no more than that of an\nunclad man, which must of course have been worthless; until they put him\ninto a sack, and in that form received it. This fellow said that he was\ncoming home towards his family, very late one Friday night; and he knew\nthat it was Friday night because of the songs along the road of the folk\nfrom Barnstaple market. He kept himself out of their way, because they\nhad such a heap of clothes on; and being established upon the sands, for\nthe purpose of washing his wife and children, who never had seen water\nbefore, and had therefore become visited, he made a short cut across the\nsands to the hole they had all helped to scoop out, in a stiff place\nwhere some roots grew. This was his home; and not a bad one for a\nsea-side visit. At any rate he seemed to have been as happy there as any\nman with a family can experience; especially when all the members need\ncontinual friction.\n\nThis fine fellow was considering how he could get on at all with that\nnecessary practice, if the magistrates should order all his frame to be\ncovered up; and fearing much to lose all chance of any natural\naction--because there was a crusade threatened--he lay down in the\nmoonlight, and had a thoroughly fine roll in the sand. Before he had\nworn out this delight, and while he stopped to enjoy it more, he heard a\nsound, not far away, of somebody digging rapidly. Or at any rate, if it\nwas not digging, it was something like it. The weather was wonderfully\nhot, so that the rushes scarcely felt even cool to his breast and legs.\nIn that utterly lonely place (for now the road was a mile behind him,\nand the sands without a track, and the stars almost at midnight), there\ncame upon him sudden fright, impossible to reason with. He had nothing\nto be robbed off, neither had he enemy; as for soul, he never yet had\nheard of any such ownership. But an unknown latitude of terror\noverpowered him. Nothing leads a man like fear; and this poor savage,\nthough so naked, was a man of some sort.\n\nTherefore, although he would far liefer have skulked off in the\ncrannying shadows, leaving the moon to see to it, he could by no means\nfind the power to withdraw himself like that. The sound came through the\nrushes, and between the moonlit hillocks so, that he was bound to follow\nit. Crouching through the darker seams, and setting down his toe-balls\nfirst, as naked feet alone can do, step by step he drew more near,\nthough longing to be further off. And still he heard the heel-struck\nspade, and then a cast, and then the sullen sound of sand a-sliding.\nThen he came to a hollow place, and feared to turn the corner.\n\nBeing by this time frightened more than any words can set before us,\nback he stroked his shaggy hair, and in a hat of rushes laid his poor\nwild face for gazing. And in the depth of the hollow where the moonlight\nscarcely marked itself, and there seemed a softer herbage than of dry\njunk-rushes, but the banks combed over so as to bury the whole three\nfathoms deep at their very first subsiding--a man was digging a small\ndeep grave.\n\nOn the slope of the bank, and so as to do no mischief any longer, two\nlittle bodies lay put back; not flung anyhow; but laid, as if respect\nwas shown to them. Each had a clean white night-gown on, and lay in\ndecorous attitude, only side by side, and ready to go into the grave\ntogether. The man who was digging looked up at them, and sighed at so\nmuch necessity; and then fell to again, and seemed desirous to have done\nwith it.\n\nSo was the naked man who watched him, fright by this time over-creeping\neven his very eyeballs. He blessed himself for his harmlessness, and\nill-will to discipline, all the way home to his own sandhill; and a\nhundredfold when he came to know (after the dregs of fright had cleared)\nthat he had seen laid by for coolness, by this awful gravedigger, the\ncocked-hat of a British Captain in the Royal Navy. This hat he had seen\nonce before, and wondered much at the use of it, and obtained an\nexplanation which he could not help remembering. And fitting this to his\nown ideas, he was as sure as sure could be, that Captain Bampfylde was\nthe man who was burying the children.\n\nNow when this story reached the ears of poor old Sir Philip, whether\nbefore or after his visit to our country matters not, it may be supposed\nwhat his feelings were of sorrow and indignation. He sent for this\nsavage, who seemed beyond the rest of his tribe in intelligence, as\nindeed was plainly shown by his coming to bathe his family, and in spite\nof all the difference of rank and manner between them, questions\nmanifold he put, but never shook his story. And then he sent to Exeter\nfor a lawyer, thoroughly famous for turning any man inside out and\nputting what he pleased inside him. But even he was altogether puzzled\nby this man in the sack, wherein he now lived for decorum\'s sake,\nhowever raw it made him. And the honest fellow said that clothing\ntempted him so to forsake the truth, when he could not tell his own legs\nin it, that it sapped all principle.\n\nThat question is not for me to deal with, nor even a very much wiser\nman, except that my glimpses of foreign tribes have all been in favour\nof nudity. And the opposite practice is evidently against all the bent\nof our civilised women, who are perpetually rebelling, and more and more\neager to open their hearts to their natural manifestation. For the heart\nof a woman is not like a man\'s, ""desperately wicked;"" and how can they\nprove this unless they show its usual style of working? Only the other\nday I saw----but back I must go to the heart of my tale. In a word,\nthis fine male savage convinced every one he came into contact with\n(which after his bathing was permitted, if the other man bathed\nafterwards), that truly, surely, and with no mistake he must have seen\nsomething. What it was became naturally quite another question; and upon\nthis head no two people could be found of one opinion. But though it\nproved an important point, I will not dwell too long on it.\n\nCaptain Drake\'s boat, to my firm belief, never came once up the river\nnow; and I thought that my beautiful young lady seemed a little grieved\nat this. Every now and then she crossed, on her way to see old women,\nand even that old Mother Bang; and the French maid became a plague to\nme. She had laid herself out to obtain me, because of the softness with\nwhich I carried her; and her opposition to my quid naturally set her\nheart all the more upon me. I will not be false enough to say that I did\nnot think of her sometimes, because she really did go on in a\ntantalising manner. And we seemed to have between us something, when her\nlady\'s back was turned. However, she ought to have known that I never\nmean anything by this; and if she chose to lie back like that, and put\nher red lips toppermost, the least thing she should have done was first\nto be up to our manners and customs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nA FINE OLD GENTLEMAN.\n\n\nWhen I came to look round upon this state of things, and consider it, I\nmade up my mind to tempt Providence, or rather perhaps the most opposite\nPower, by holding on where I was, in spite of the Parson and all his\ndevices. This was a stupid resolve, and one on which he had fully\ncalculated. I was getting a little perhaps fond of Nanette, though not\nquite so much as she fancied; feeling unable to pin my faith to a thing\nshe had whispered into my ear; to wit, that she would thrice soon\ninherit one three grand money, hunder tousand, more than one great\nstrong man could leeft. I asked her to let me come and try; and she said\nit was possible to be. Having a thorough acquaintance with Crappos, and\nthe small wretched particles of their money, I did not attach much\nimportance to this; for I like our King\'s face, and they have not got\nit; and they seem to stamp their stuff anyhow. But in spite of all\nprejudice, it would be well to look a little into it; particularly as\nthis girl (whether right or wrong in thousands) had a figure not to be\ndenied, when you came home to her.\n\nNevertheless I am not the man to part with myself at random; and there\nwas a good farmer\'s daughter now, solid, and two-and-thirty--which is my\nfavourite ship to sail in, handy, strong, and with guns well up--this\nyoung woman crossed the ferry, at eightpence a-day, for my sake; and I\nthought of retaining a lawyer to find what might be her prospects. She\nwas by no means bad to look at, when you got accustomed; and her nature\nvery kind, and likely to see to Bunny\'s clothes; also she never\ncontradicted; which is cotton-wool to one who ever has rheumatics. But I\ndid not wish to pay six-and-eightpence, and then be compelled to lose\neightpence a-day, in order to steer clear of her. So I ferried both her\nand Nanette alike, and let them encounter one another, and charged no\ndifference in their weight.\n\nNothing better fits a man, for dealing with the womankind, than to be\nwell up in fish. Now I found the benefit of that knowledge where I never\nlooked for it; and I knew the stale from the fresh--though these come\nalike in the pickle of matrimony--also (which is far more to the point)\nthe soft roes from the hard roes. These you cannot change; but must\npersuade yourself to like whichever you happen to get of them. And that\nyou find out afterwards.\n\nWhile I was dwelling upon these trifles, and getting on well with my\nserious trade, working my ferry, and catching salmon so as to amaze the\nneighbourhood, also receiving my well-earned salary from the fair\nMistress Isabel, and surprising the public-houses every night with my\nnarratives--in a word, becoming the polar-star of both sides of the\nriver--a thing befell me which was quite beyond all sense of reason.\n\nThrough wholesome fear of Parson Chowne, and knowledge of his\nfire-tricks, I kept the Rose of Devon in a berth of deep fresh water;\nwhere a bulk of sand backed up, and left a large calm pool of river.\nHere the dimpling water scarcely had the life to flow along--when the\ntide was well away; and scarcely brought a single bubble big enough to\nbreak upon us. According to the weather, so the colour of the water was.\nOnly when you understood, it seemed to please you always.\n\nOne night I was not asleep, but getting very near it; setting in my mind\nafloat (as I felt the young tide flowing) thoughts or dreams, or lighter\nvisions than the lightest dream that flits, of, about, concerning,\ntouching, anyhow regarding, or, in any lightest side-light, gleaming,\nwho can tell, or glancing from the chequers of the day-work. Suddenly a\ngreat explosion blew me out of my berth, and filled the whole of the\ncuddy with blaze and smoke. I lay on the floor half-stunned, and with\nonly sense enough for wondering. Then Providence enabled me, on the\nstrength of the battles I had been through, to get on my elbow, and look\naround. Everything seemed quite odd and stupid for a little while to me.\nI neither knew where I was, nor what had happened or would happen me.\n\nIt may have been half an hour, or it may have been only half a minute,\nbefore I was all alive again, and able to see to the mischief. Then I\nfound that a very rude thing had been done, and a most unclerical\naction, not to be lightly excused, and wholly Undeserved on my part. A\ngood-sized kettle of gunpowder had been cast into my cuddy, possibly as\na warning to me; but, to say the least, a dangerous one. My wrath\novercame all fear so much, that in spite of the risk of meeting others,\nI rushed through the smoke and up the ladder, and seized my gun from its\nsling on the deck, and gazed (or rather I should say stared) in every\ndirection around me. But whether from the darkness of the night, or the\nstinging and stunning turmoil in my eyes and upon my brain, I could not\ndescry any moving shape, or any living creature. And this even added to\nmy alarm, so that I got very little more sleep that night, I do assure\nyou.\n\nHowever, I kept my own counsel about it, even from my lady patroness,\nresolving to maintain a sharp look-out, and act as behoved a gallant\nCymro, thrown amongst a host of savages. To this intent, I took our\ntiller, which was just about six feet long, and entirely useless now,\nand I put a bit of a bottom to it, so as to stand quite decently, and\nfixed a cross-tressel for shoulders, and then dressed it up so with my\nold fishing-suit and a castaway hat to encourage my brains, that really,\nthough the thing was so grave, I could not help laughing at myself; in\nthe dusk it was so like me. When the labours of the day were over, and\nthe gleam of the water deadened, I set up this other fine Davy\nLlewellyn on board the ketch, now here now there, sometimes leaning over\nthe bulwarks in contemplation of the river (which was my favourite\nattitude, from my natural turn for reflection), sometimes idly at work\nwith a rope, or anything or nothing, only so as to be seen from shore,\nand expose to the public his whereabouts. Meanwhile I crouched in a\nditch hard by, and with both barrels loaded.\n\nYou will say this was an unchristian thing, especially as I suspected\nstrongly that my besiegers wore naked backs, and would therefore receive\nmy discharge in full. I will not argue that point, but tell you (in\ncommon fairness to myself, and to prevent any slur of the warm\naffection, long subsisting between all who have cared to listen to me\nand my free self) that whenever I hoped for a chance at those fellows, I\ndrew the duck-shot from the first barrel, and put a light charge of\nsnipe-shot in, which no man could object to. The second barrel was\nready, in case that the worst should come to the worst, as we say.\n\nNow it is a proof of my bad luck, and perhaps of my having done a thing\nbelow the high Welsh nature, that Providence never vouchsafed me a\nsingle shot at any one of them. The more trouble I took, the less they\ncame; until I could scarcely crook my fingers through the rheumatics\nthey brought on me. Night after night, I said to myself, ""If it only\npleases the Lord to save me from the wiles of this anointed one, I vow\nto go back to my duty, and teach those other young chits of boys their\nwork."" For I had observed (though I would not tell it, except in a\nrheumatic twinge) that even Captain Bampfylde\'s men had lost the style\nof drawing oars through the water properly, and as I used to give the\ntune, five-and-twenty years agone.\n\nIt is needless to say, that after all the close actions I have conquered\nin, a canister of gunpowder was nothing to disturb me. But as they might\ndo worse next time, whether in joke or earnest, I made me a hutch of\nstout strong oak, also cut the bulkhead out, and freed myself into the\nhold at once, upon any unjust disturbance. Nigh me was my double gun,\nheavily shotted at bedtime, and the spar which had knocked down Parson\nChowne, and might have to do it again perhaps. And now I began to\npersuade myself into happy sleep again; for my nature is not vindictive.\n\nOne night I lay broad awake, perhaps from having shot a curlew, and\neaten him, without an onion sewn inside while roasting, but he had been\nso hard to shoot that I was full of zeal to dine upon him, and had no\nonion handy. Whether it were so or not, I lay awake and thought about\nthe strange things now come over me. To be earning money at a very noble\nrate indeed; to be winning the attentions of it may be ten young women\n(each of whom believed that never had I been in love before); and to be\nestablishing a business which could scarcely fail of growing to a\npublic-house with benches and glass windows looking down upon the river;\nand yet with all this prospect brewing, scarcely to have a moment\'s\npeace! What a lucky thing for Parson Chowne that I have no cold black\nblood in me! In this medley of vague thoughts (such as all men of large\nbrain have, and even myself when the moon ordains it) a strong and good\nidea struck me, and one to be dwelled upon to-morrow; and if then\napproved, to be carried out immediately. This was no less than to beg an\naudience of Sir Philip Bampfylde himself, and tell him all that I ever\nhad seen of Chowne and his devices, and place Sir Philip on his guard,\nand learn maybe a little of the many things that puzzled me. Of course I\nhad thought of this before; but for several reasons had forborne to\ncarry it any further. In the first place, it seemed such a coarse rude\nway of meeting plans that should be met with equal stealth and subtlety,\nunless a man were prepared to own himself vanquished in intelligence.\nAgain, it would have been very difficult to obtain a private interview\nwithout some stir concerning it. Moreover, I felt a delicacy with\nrespect to my stewardship on behalf of those two children; for a\nstranger might not at a glance perceive that prudence and self-denial on\nmy part, which the worrisome frivolousness of the fish had, for the\ntime, frustrated. However, I now perceived that a gentleman of Sir\nPhilip\'s lofty bearing could not with any grace or dignity allude to his\nown beneficence; and as for the second difficulty, I might hope for Miss\nCarey\'s good offices, while I could no longer think to encounter Chowne\nwith his own weapons, since he had blown me out of bed.\n\nAccordingly I persuaded my beautiful young lady, who had plenty of sense\nbut not much craft, and was pleased with my straightforwardness, to lead\nme into Sir Philip\'s presence in a lonely part of the grounds near the\nriver, to the westward, and out of sight of the house; in a word, not\nfar from the Braunton Burrows.\n\nHere the river made a bend and came to the breast of an ancient\norchard, rich with grass and thick with trees leafless now, but thickly\nbearded upon every twig with moss. This was of every form and fashion,\nand of almost every hue. I had never seen such a freaksome piece of work\noutside the tropics, although in Devonshire common enough, where the\nsoil is moist and the climate damp. Some of these trees lay down on the\nground, as if they wore tired of standing, and some were in sitting\npostures, and some half leaning over; but all alive, in spite of that,\nand fruitful when it suited them. And everything being neglected now,\nfrom want of the Squire\'s attention, heaps of rosy and golden apples lay\nwhere they had been piled to sweat, but never led to the cider-press.\n\nPerceiving no sign of Sir Philip about, and remembering how it was now\nbeginning to draw on for Christmas-time, I felt myself welcome to one or\ntwo of these neglected apples; for it was much if nobody of the farmers\'\nwives who crossed the ferry could afford me a goose for Christmas in my\nsolitary hole. And even if all should fail disgracefully of their duty\ntowards me, I had my eye on a nice young bird of more than the average\nplumpness, who neglected his parents\' advice every day, and came for\nsome favourite grass of his, which only grew just on the river\'s verge,\nwithin thirty yards of my fusil. It would have shown low curiosity to\nask if he owned an owner. From his independent manner I felt that he\nmust be public property; and I meant to reduce him into possession right\nearly in the morning of the Saint that was so incredulous. It is every\nman\'s duty to treat himself well at the time of the Holy Nativity; and\nhaving a knowledge of Devonshire geese, after two months on the\nstubbles, I could not do better than store in my boat one or two of\nthese derelict apples.\n\nNever do I see or taste an apple without thinking of poor Bardie.\n""Appledies,"" she always called them, and she was so fond of them, and\nher little white teeth made marks like a small-tooth comb in the flesh\nof them. I was thinking of her, and had scarcely embarked more than a\nbushel or so, for sauce, in a little snug locker of my own, when I had\nthe pleasure of seeing the gentleman whom I had come all that way to\nsee.\n\nAt my own desire, and through Miss Carey\'s faith in me, it had not been\nlaid before Sir Philip that I was likely to meet him here; only she had\ntold me when and where to come across him, so as not to be broken in\nupon. Now he came down the narrow winding walk, at the lower side of the\norchard, a path overhanging a little brook which murmured under last\nsummer\'s growth; and I gazed at him silently for a while, through the\nbushes that overhung my boat. He was dressed as when I had seen him last\nthrough my telescope, at the time we came up the river; that is to say,\nin black velvet, and with his long sword hanging beside him. A brave,\nand stately, and noble man, walking through a steady gloom of grief, and\nyet content to walk alone, and never speak of it.\n\nI leaped through the bush at the river\'s brink, and suddenly stood\nbefore him. He set his calm cold gaze upon me, without a shadow of\nsurprise, as if to say, ""You have no business in my private grounds;\nhowever, it is not worth speaking of."" I made him a low bow with my hat\noff; and he moved his own, and was passing on.\n\n""Will your Worship look at me,"" I said, ""and see whether you remember\nme?"" He seemed just a little surprised, and then with his inborn\ncourtesy complied.\n\n""I have seen you before, but I know not where. Sir, I often need pardon\nnow for the weakness of my memory.""\n\nIn a few short words I brought to his mind that evening visit to my\ncottage, with Anthony Stew and the yellow carriage.\n\n""To be sure, to be sure! I remember now,"" he said, with his grave and\nplacid smile: ""David Llewellyn! Both good old names, and the latter, I\ndaresay, in your belief, both the older and the better one. I remember\nyour hospitality, your patience, and your love of children. Is there\nanything I can do for you?""\n\n""No, your Worship, nothing. I am here for your sake only; although if I\nwanted, I would ask you, having found you so good and kind.""\n\n""Whence did you get that expression, my friend? The common usage is\n\'kind and good;\' I once knew a very little child--but I suppose it is\nthe Welsh idiom.""\n\n""Your Worship, I can speak English thoroughly; better even than my own\nlanguage; and all around us the scholarly people have more English than\nof Welsh. But to let your Worship know my cause to come so much upon\nyou, is of things more to the purpose. I have found a bad man meaning\nmischief to your Worship.""\n\n""It cannot be so,"" he replied, withdrawing, as if I were taking a\nliberty; ""no doubt but you mean me well, Llewellyn, and yourself believe\nit. But neither I, nor any one else of all my family, now so small, can\nhave given reason for any ill-will towards us.""\n\nIt was not for me to dare to speak, while the General was reflecting\nthus, as if in his own mind going through every small accident of his\nlife; even the servants he might have discharged; or the land-forces\nordered for punishment, whereof to my mind they lack more than they get,\nand grow their backs up in a manner beyond all perception of discipline.\n\nFor my part, I could not help thinking, as I watched him carefully, how\nlow and black must be the nature of the heart that could rejoice in such\na man\'s unhappiness. A man who, at threescore years and five, was\ncompelled to rack his memory (even after being long in uncontrolled\nauthority) to find a time when he might have given cause for private\nenmity! If I had only enjoyed such chances, I must have had at least a\nscore of strong enemies by this time. Being a little surprised, I looked\nagain and again at his white eyebrows, while his eyes were on the\nground; also at his lips and nostrils, which were highly dignified. And\nI saw, in my dry low way, one reason why he had never given offence. He\nwas perhaps a little scant of humour and of quickness; which two things\ngive more offence to the outer world that has them not, than the longest\ncourse of rigid business carried on without them. I have seen a man who\ncould not crack nuts fly into a fury with one who could. And these\nreflections made me even yet more anxious to serve him, so grave, and\ncalm, and simple-minded, and so patient was his face.\n\nNevertheless I did not desire, and would at the point of his sword have\nrefused, a halfpenny, for the things of import which I now disclosed to\nhim. He led me to an ancient bench, beneath a well-worn apple-tree; and\nsat thereon, and even signed for me to sit beside him. My knowledge of\nhis rank would not permit me to do this; until I was compelled to argue.\nA gentleman more shaped and set inside his own opinions, it had never\nbeen my luck to have to deal with, now and then. There are men you\ncannot laugh at, though you get the best of them, unless your conscience\nworks with such integrity as theirs does. And the sense of this, in some\nway unknown, may have now been over me. How I began it, or even showed\nmy sense of manners, and of all the different rank between us, is beyond\nmy knowledge now; and must have flowed from instinct then. Enough that I\ndid lead Sir Philip to have thoughts, and to hearken me.\n\nWith a power not expected by myself at first beginning, while in doubt\nof throat and words, I contrived to set before him much that had\nbefallen me. Though I never said a word that lay outside my knowledge,\nneither let a spark of heat find entrance to my mind at all, and would\nrather speak too little than be thought outrageous, there could be no\ndoubt that my simple way of putting all I had to say, moved this lofty\nman, as if he were one of the children at the well belonging to John the\nBaptist. I thought of all those pretty dears (as I beheld him\nlistening), and the way they sat around me, and their style of moving\ntoes at any great catastrophe; whiles they kept their hands and noses\nunder very stiff control; also the universal sigh, when my story killed\nany one by any means unfit to die; and their pure contempt of the things\nthey suck, the whole while they are swallowing. Sir Philip (to whom my\nthoughts meant no failure of respect, but feeling of simplicity), this\nold gentleman let me speak as one well accustomed to lengthiness. But I\ndid my best to keep a small helm, and yards on the creak for bracing.\n\n""If I take you aright,"" he said, as I drew near the end of my story,\n""you have not a high opinion of that reverend gentleman, Stoyle Chowne.""\n\n""I look upon him, your Worship, as the blackest-hearted son of Belial\never sent into this world.""\n\nSir Philip frowned, as behoved a man accustomed to authority, and only\nto have little words, half spoken out, before him. But at my time of\nlife, no officer under an admiral on full pay, could have any right to\ndamp my power of expression. However, my respect was such for the\npresence of this noble man, that I rose and made a leg to him.\n\n""I am sorry to say,"" he answered, bowing to my bow, as all gentlemen\nmust do; ""that this is not the first time I have heard unpleasant things\nabout poor Stoyle. He is my godson, and has been almost as one of my own\nchildren. I never can believe that he would ever do me injury. If I\nthought it, I should have to think amiss of almost every one.""\n\nHe turned away, as if already he had said more than he meaned; and\nfeeling how he treated me, as if of his own rank almost, I did not\nwonder at the tales of men who gave their lives to save him, in the\nbloody battle-time. Knowing the world as I do, I only sighed, and waited\nfor him.\n\n""You are very good,"" he said, without a tone of patronage, ""to have\nthought to help me by delivering your opinions. A heavy trouble has\nfallen upon us, and the goodwill of the neighbourhood has many times\nastonished me. However, you must indulge no more in any such wild ideas.\nThey all proceed from the evil one, and are his choicest device to lower\nthe value of holy orders. The Reverend Stoyle Chowne descends from a\nvery good old family, at any rate on his father\'s side; and he has his\ndignity to maintain, and his holy office to support him. On this head, I\nwill hear no more.""\n\nThe General shut his mouth and closed it, so that I could never dare to\nopen mine again to him, concerning this one subject. And his manner\nstopped me so that I only made my duty. This he acknowledged in a manner\nwhich became both him and me; and then he passed through a little gate\nto his usual walk upon Braunton Burrows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nNOTICE TO QUIT.\n\n\nWe were now come to the time of year which all good Christians celebrate\nby goodwill and festivities. Even I, in my humble way, had made some\npreparation for this holy period by shooting Farmer Badcock\'s goose;\nwhich had long been in my mind. Upon plucking, he turned out even whiter\nand better than expectation, and the tender down clung to him, in a way\nthat showed his texture. I hung him up in a fine through-draught, and\nrejoiced in the thought of him every time my head came in between his\nlegs. Neither did he fall away when he came to roasting.\n\nBut when I had put him down, upon the Christmas morning, with intent to\nstick thereby, and baste him up to one o\'clock, dipping bits of bread\nbeneath him, as he might begin to drip, and winning thus foretaste of\nhim--all my plans were overset by a merry party coming, and demanding\n""ferry."" With my lovely goose beginning just to spread his skin a\nlittle, and hiss sweetly at the fire, up I ran, with resolution not to\nferry anybody, but to cook my goose aright.\n\nNevertheless it might not be so. Here were three young fellows ramping\nof the high nobility, swearing to come aboard and stick me, if I would\nnot ferry them. It was not that I feared of this, but that I beheld a\nguinea spinning in the morning sun, which compelled me to forego, and\nleave my poor young goose to roll around, and try to roast himself.\nTherefore I backed him from the fire, and laid half a pound of slow lard\non his breast, and trusted his honour to keep alive.\n\nThese young joyous fellows now were awake to everything. They had begun\nthe morning bravely with a cup of rum and lemon, then a tender grill of\nbeef, and a quart of creamy ale, every one accordingly. And they meant\nto keep the day up to no less a pattern, being all of fine old birth,\nand bound to act accordingly. However, it had been said by some one,\nthat they ought to go to church; and they happened to feel the strength\nof this, and vowed that the devil should catch the hindmost, unless they\nstruck out for it.\n\nHence I came to win the pleasure of their company, that day. Their\nnearest church was the little, simple, quiet old church at Ashford. From\nmy ferry I could see it; and it often made me sigh, because it looked so\ntranquil. Sweet green land sloped up towards it, with a trace of crooked\nfootpaths, and the nicks of elbowed hedges, where the cows came down and\nstood. Also from it, looking downward through the valley of the Tawe,\nmay be seen a spread of beauty, and of soft variety, and of largeness\nopening larger with the many winding waters, to the ocean unbeheld, that\nthe sternest man must sigh, and look again and look again.\n\nA genuine parson now was master of this queer old quiet church; a man\nwho gave his life entire for the good of other men. In a little hut he\nlived, which the clerk\'s house overrode, just at the turning of the\nlane, upon the steep ascent, and where the thunder-showers flooded it.\nAll the poor folk soon began to dwell upon his noble nature, and to feel\nthat here was some one fit to talk of Saviours. Miles around they came\nto hear him, so that he was forced to stand on a stool in the porch, and\nspeak to them. For speaking it was, and not preaching; which made all\nthe difference.\n\nThese three gay young sparks leaped lightly into the bow of my\nferry-boat, and bade me pull for my very life, unless I desired to be\nflung into the water then and there. A strong spring-tide was running\nup, and I was forced to pull the starboard oar with all my might to keep\nthe course. My passengers were carrying on with every sort of quip and\ncrank, and jokes, that made the boat to tilt, when suddenly a rush of\nwater flooded their silk stockings. I thought at first that the bung\nwas out, and told them not to be frightened; but in another breath I saw\nthat it was a great deal worse than that. The water was rushing in\nthrough a mighty hole in the planks of the larboard bow; and in three\nminutes we must be swamped. ""All aft, all aft in a moment!"" I cried; ""it\nis our only chance of reaching shore."" The gallants were sobered at once\nby fright, and I bundled them into the stern-sheets, sat on the aftmost\nthwart myself, and for the lives of us all pulled back towards the bank\nwe had lately quitted. By casting all the weight thus astern, I raised\nthe leak up to the water-line, except when we plunged to the lift of the\noars, and the water poured in less rapidly now, with the set of the tide\non our starboard beam. However, with all this, and all my speed, and my\npassengers showing great presence of mind, we barely managed to touch\nthe bank and jump out, when down she foundered.\n\nAt first I was at a loss altogether even to guess how this thing had\nhappened; for the boat seemed perfectly sound and dry at the time of our\nleaving the shore. But as soon as the tide was out, and I could get at\nher, I perceived that a trick of entirely fiendish cunning and atrocity\nhad been played upon me. A piece of planking a foot in length and from\neight to ten inches wide had been cut out with a key-hole saw, at the\ntime she was lying high and dry, and doubtless before daybreak. This had\nbeen then replaced most carefully with a little caulking, so that it was\nwater-tight without strong pressure from outside; but the villain had\ncontrived it, knowing in what state of tide I was likely next to work\nthe ferry, so that the rush of water could not fail to beat the piece\nin.\n\nIt made my blood run cold to think of the stealthiness of this attempt,\nas well as the skill it was compassed with, for the chances were ten to\none almost in favour of its drowning me, and leaving a bad name behind\nme too, for having drowned my passengers. And to this it must have come\nif so much as a single woman had been in the boat that day. For these,\nwhen in danger, always do the very worst thing possible; and the manager\nof this clever scheme knew of course that my freight was likely, on the\nChristmas morning, to be chiefly female. Luckily I had refused two\nboat-loads of young and attractive womankind, not from religious feeling\nonly, but because I had to chop a trencherful of stuffing.\n\nThis affair impressed me so with a sense of awe and reverence, and a\ncertainty that Parson Chowne must be in direct receipt of counsel from\nthe evil one, that my mind was good to be off at once, and thank the\nLord for escaping him. For let us see what must have happened but for\nthe goodness and fatherly care of a merciful Providence over me. The\nboat would have sunk in the very midst of the rapid and icy river. David\nLlewellyn, with his accustomed fortitude, would have endeavoured to swim\nashore, and yet could not have resisted the claims of three or even four\nyoung women, who doubtless would have laid hold of him, all screaming,\nsplashing, and dragging him down. The mind refuses to contemplate such a\npicture any longer!\n\nThis matter could not be kept quiet, as the first attempt had been, but\nspread from house to house, and gained in size from each successive\ntongue, until the man at the foot of the bridge, who naturally detested\nme, whispered into every ear, that it was high time to have a care of\nthat interloping Welshman, who had drowned six fine young noblemen, for\nthe sake of their buckles and watches. And my courage was at so low an\nebb, that when he retreated into his house, I could not even bring my\nmind to the power of kicking his door in. Hence that calumny, not being\nquenched, went the round of the neighbourhood; and I might as well haul\ndown my sign, and the hopes of any public-house became a fading vision.\nAnd of all the fine young women who had set their hearts upon keeping it\n(as I described my intention to them), and who had picked up bits of\nWelsh, for an access to my heart in all its patriotism, there was not\none worth looking at, or fit to be a landlady, who took the trouble to\ncome near me, in the frosty weather.\n\nWhen a man is forsaken by the world, he must have recourse to reason.\nAnd if only borne up thereby, and with a little cash in hand, he can\nwait till the world comes round again. This was my position now. I never\nhad behaved so well in all my life before, I think; though always\nconscientious. But of late I had felt, as it were, in one perpetual\nround of bitter wrestling with the evil one. Men of a loose kind may not\nsee that this was tenfold hard upon me, from my props being knocked\naway. I mean my entire trust and leaning upon the ancient Church of\nEngland, which (perhaps by repulsion from those fellows that came after\nour old ham, as well as our proper parson\'s knowledge of soles and the\nway to fry them) had increased upon me so, that my heart leaped up\nwhenever I heard the swing of a bell on Sunday. Some of this perhaps\nwas owing to my thoughts of Newton clock, and twelve shillings now due\nto me from my captainship thereof: but how could this loyal and\necclesiastical fervour thrive, while a man in holy orders did such\nunholy things to me?\n\nThe only one with faith enough, and sense enough, to stand by me now,\nthrough this bitter trial, was that beautiful young lady, whom I did\nadmire so. And if till now I admired only, now I did adore her. Nanette\ndid for herself with me, and all her hopes of ever being Mrs David\nLlewellyn, by poking up her little toes,--and I saw that they were all\nsquare almost,--and with guttural noises crying that on board my boat\nshe would not dare. Miss Carey laughed at her, and stepped with her\nbeautiful boots on board of me; and from that moment she might do\nexactly as she pleased with me.\n\nHowever my ferry was knocked on the head; and all the hopes of a wife\nand family, and even a public-house and skittles, which I had long been\nbuilding up, as well as to train our Bunny for barmaid; which must\nalways be done quite young, to get the proper style of it, and thorough\nacquaintance with measures, how to make them look quite brim up when\nthey are only three-parts full. All golden dreams will vanish thus; no\nlife of smiling Boniface, but of gun-muzzles was before me; no\ncasting-up of shot by pence, but ramming down on pounds of powder. Let\nthat pass; my only wish is to conceal, in the strictest manner, little\ntrifles about myself.\n\nIsabel Carey was so shocked at hearing of our danger (as by me\ndistinctly told without a word of flourish), that she made me promise\nstrongly to give up my ferrying. This I was becoming ready, more and\nmore every day, to do; especially as nobody ever now came down for\nporterage. But I told the lady how hard it was to have formed such a\nvaluable trade, or you might say an institution; and then to lose it\nall, because of certain private enmities. What she said or did hereon is\nstrictly a family question, and can in no way concern the public, since\nI hauled my flag down.\n\nAnd now I gained more insight into my great enemy\'s schemes and doings,\nthan I could have acquired while engaged so much at ferry. For time\nallowed me to maintain that strict watch upon Narnton Court, which was\nnow become my duty, as well as an especial pleasure, for the following\nreason. I began to see most clearly that the foul outrage upon my boat\nmust have been perpetrated by one or both of those savage fellows who\nwere employed as spies upon this great house, from the landward side.\nThey must have forded the river, which is not more than three feet deep\nin places, when the tide is out, and no floods coming down. These two\ncunning barbarians came of course from the Nympton rookery, but were\nlodging for the present in a hole they had scooped for themselves in the\nloneliest part of Braunton Burrows. Of course they durst not go about in\na peopled and civilised neighbourhood, with such an absence of apparel\nas they could indulge at home. Still they were unsightly objects; and\ndecent people gave them a wide berth, when possible. But my firm\nintention was to grapple with these savage scoundrels, and to prove at\ntheir expense what a civilised Welshman is, and how capable of asserting\nhis commercial privileges. Only as they carried knives, I durst not meet\nthem both at once; and even should I catch them singly, some care was\nadvisable, so as take them off their guard; because I would not lower\nmyself to the use of anything more barbarous than an honest cudgel.\n\nHowever, although I watched and waited, and caught sight of them more\nthan once, especially at night-time when they roved most freely, it was\nlong before I found it prudent to bear down on the enemy. Not from any\nfear of them, but for fear of slaying them, as I might be forced to do,\nif they rushed with steel at me.\n\nOne night, after the turn of the days, and with mild weather now\nprevailing, and a sense of spring already fluttering in the valleys, I\nsat in a dark embrasure at the end of Narnton Court. There had been more\nlight than usual in the windows of the great dining-room, which now was\nvery seldom used for hospitable purposes. And now two gentlemen came\nforth, as if for a little air, to take a turn on the river-terrace. It\ndid not cost me long to learn that one was good Sir Philip Bampfylde,\nand the other that very wicked Chowne. The latter had manifestly been\ntelling some of his choicest stories, and held the upper hand as usual.\n\n""General, take my arm. The flags are rough, and the night is of the\ndarkest. You must gravel this terrace, for the sake of your guests,\nafter your port-wine.""\n\n""Dick,"" said the General, with a sigh, for he was a most hospitable man,\nand accustomed to the army; ""Dick, thou hast hardly touched my port; and\nI like not to have it slighted, sir.""\n\nWhat excuse the Parson made I did not hear, but knew already that one of\nhis countless villanies was his rude contempt of the gift of God, as\nvouchsafed to Noah, and confirmed by the very first rainbow, which\ncontinues the colours thereof up to this time of writing.\n\nSir Philip leaned on the parapet some twenty yards to windward of me,\nand he sniffed the fine fresh smell of sea-weed and sea-water coming up\nthe river with a movement of four knots an hour. And in his heart he\nthanked the Lord, very likely without knowing it. Then he seemed to sigh\na little, and to turn to Chowne, and say--\n\n""Dick, this is not as it should be. Look at all this place, and up and\ndown all this length of river; every light you can see burning, is in a\nhouse that \'longs to me. And who is now to have it all? It used to make\nme proud; but now it makes me very humble. You are a parson; tell me,\nDick, what have I done to deserve it all?""\n\nThe Rev. Richard Stoyle Chowne had not--whatever his other vices\nwere--one grain of pious hypocrisy in all his foul composition. If he\nhad, he might have flourished, and with his native power, must have been\none of the foremost men of this, or any other age. But his pride allowed\nhim never to let in pretence religious into the texture of his ways. A\nworse man need not be desired: and yet he did abhor all cant, to such a\ndegree that he made a mock of his own church-services.\n\n""General, I have nought to say. You have asked this question more than\nonce. You know what my opinion is.""\n\n""I know that you have the confidence, sir, every honourable man must\nhave, in my poor son\'s innocence. You support it against every one.""\n\n""Against all the world: against even you, when you allow yourself to\ndoubt it. Tush! I would not twice think of it. However many candles\nburn""--this was a touch of his nasty sarcasm, which he never could deny\nhimself--""up and down the valley, General, no son of yours, however\nwild, and troubled in expenditure, could ever shape or even dream of\nanything dishonourable.""\n\n""I hope not--I hope to God, not,"" Sir Philip said, with a little gasp,\nas if he were fearing otherwise: ""Dick, you are my godson, and you have\nbeen the greatest comfort to me; because you never would believe----""\n\n""Not another word, General. You must not dwell on this matter so. The\nchildren were fine little dears of course, very clever and very\nprecious----""\n\n""Oh, if you only knew the words, Dick, my little granddaughter could\ncome out with! Scarcely anything you could think of would have been too\nbig for her little mouth. And if she could not do it once, she never\nleft it till she did. Where it came from I could not tell, for we are\nnot great at languages: but it must have been of her mother\'s race. And\nthe boy, though not with gifts of that sort--oh, you ought to have seen\nhis legs, Dick--at least till he took the whooping-cough!"" The stately\nold gentleman leaned, and dropped a tear perhaps into the river Tawe.\n\n""General, I understand it all,"" said Chowne, though he never had a\nchild, by reason of the Almighty\'s mercy to the next generation: ""of\ncourse these pretty children were a great delight to every one. But\naffairs of this sort happen in all ancient families. The mere extent of\nland appears to open for clandestine graves----""\n\n""That wicked devilish story, Dick! Did you tell me, or did you not, to\ntake it as the Fiend\'s own lie?""\n\n""A lie, of course, as concerns the Captain: from their want of\nknowledge. But concerning some one else, true enough, I fear, I fear.""\n\nBoth men had by this time very nearly said their say throughout. The\nGeneral seemed to be overcome, and the Parson to be growing weary of a\nsubject often treated in discourse between them. ""Before you go in the\nmorning, Dick,"" said the old man, now recovering, ""I wish to consult you\nabout a matter nearly concerning young Isabel. She is a distant cousin\nof yours. You thoroughly understand the law, of which I have very little\nknowledge. Perhaps you will meet me in the book-room, for half an hour\'s\nquiet talk, before we go to breakfast.""\n\n""I cannot do it, Sir Philip. I have my own affairs to see to: I must be\noff when the moon is up. I cannot sleep in your house, this night.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nFORCIBLE EJECTMENT.\n\n\nThose things which have been settled for us by long generations of\nancestors, all of whom must have considered the subjects, one after the\nother painfully, and brought good minds of ancient strength (less led\naway than ours are) to bear upon what lay before them, also living in a\ntime when money went much further, and got a deal more change in\nhonesty, which was then more plentiful--to rush, I say, against the\nbulwarks of our noble elders (who showed the warmth of their faith by\nroasting all who disagreed with them), would be, ay and ever will be, a\nproof of a rebellious, scurvy, and perpetually scabby nature. The above\nfine reflection came home to me, just as my pipe grew sweet and rich,\nafter an excellent dinner, provided by that most thoughtful and bright\nyoung lady, the Honourable Isabel Carey, upon a noble New Year\'s Day, in\nthe year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three. Her\nladyship now had begun to feel that interest in my intelligence and\nunusual power of narrative, as well as that confidence in my honour and\nextreme veracity, which, without the smallest effort or pretence on my\npart, seem to spring by some law of nature in every candid mind I meet.\n\nCombining this lady\'s testimonials, as presented weekly, with some\nhonourable trifles picked up here and there along shore, in spite of all\ndiscouragement, perhaps I congratulated myself on having turned the\ncorner of another year not badly. I counted my money, to the tune of\nfive-and-twenty level pounds; an amount of cash beyond all experience!\nYet, instead of being dazzled, I began to see no reason for not having\nfifty. Not that I ever thought of money; but for the sake of the\nchildren. The tears came into my eyes, to think of these poor little\ncreatures; Bardie with all her fount of life sanded up (as one might\nsay) in that old Sker warren; and Bunny with her strength of feeding\nweakened over rice and fowl-food; such as old Charles Morgan kept, who\nhad been known to threaten to feed his family upon sawdust. A most\nrespectable man, as well as churchwarden and undertaker; but being bred\na pure carpenter, he thought (when his money came in fast, and great\nsuccess surprised him) that Providence would be offended at his waste of\nsawdust.\n\nNow this was the man who had Bunny to keep, entirely from his own wish\nof course, or the sense of the village concerning her; and many times I\nhad been ready to laugh, and as many times to cry almost, whenever I\nthought of the many things that were likely to happen between them. To\nlaugh, when I thought of Churchwarden\'s face regarding our Bunny at\nbreakfast-time, and the way she would say, ""I want some more,"" through\nhis narrow-shouldered children. To cry, when I thought of my dear son\'s\nchild (and as dear to me as my own almost) getting less of victuals\ndaily, as her welcome should grow staler, and giving way to her old\ntrick of standing on the floor with eyes shut, and with shut mouth to\ndeclare, ""I won\'t eat, now you have starved me so;"" and no one in that\nhouse with wit to understand and humour her. And then I could see her go\nto bed, in a violent temper anyhow: and when the wind boxed round to\nnorth, I could hear her calling, ""Granny.""\n\nThis very tender state of mind, and sense of domestic memories, seems to\nhave drawn me (so far as I can, in a difficult case, remember it)\ntowards a very ancient inn having two bow-windows. When I entered, no\nman could be in a stricter state of sobriety: and as if it were\nyesterday, I remember asking the price of everything. The people were\neven inclined to refuse to draw anything in the small-liquor line for a\nman with so little respect for trade as to walk so straight upon New\nYear\'s Day. After a little while, I made them see that this was not so\nmuch my fault as my misfortune; and when I declared my name, of course,\nand my character came forward, even rum-shrub out of a cask with golden\nhoops around it scarcely seemed to be considered good enough for me,\ngratis. But throughout the whole of this, I felt an anxious and burning\nsense of eager responsibility, coupled with a strong desire to be\neverywhere at once.\n\nRight early, to the very utmost of my recollection, I tumbled into my\nlonely berth, after seeing my fusil primed, and praying to the Lord for\nguidance through another and a better year. I had clean sheets, which\nare my most luxurious gift of feeling; and having no room to stretch my\nlegs, or roll, I managed space to yawn, and then went off deliciously.\nNow I was beginning to dream about the hole I had placed my money in--a\nclever contrivance of my own, and not in the cuddy at all, because the\nenemy might attack me there--when a terrible fit of coughing came and\nsaved my life by waking me. The little cuddy was full of\nsmoke--parching, blinding, choking smoke--so thick that I could scarcely\nsee the red glare of fire behind it, through the brattice of the\nbulkhead.\n\n""Good Lord,"" I cried, ""have mercy on me! Sure enough, I am done for now.\nAnd nobody ever will know or care what the end was of old Dyo!""\n\nI did not stop still to say all this, that you may be quite sure of, and\nit argues no small power of speech that I was able to say anything. For\nwith a last desire for life, and despairing resolve to try again, I\nbroke my knuckles against the hatch which I had made so heavy for the\npurpose of protecting me. To go out through my door would have been to\nrush into the fire itself; and what with the choking, and the thickness,\nand the terror of the flames violently reddening and roaring a few feet\naway, I felt my wits beginning to fail me, which of course was certain\ndeath. So I sate down on a three-legged stool, which was all my\nfurniture; and for a moment the rushing smoke drew, by some draught,\notherwhere; and whether I would or no, a deal of my past life came up to\nme. I wondered whether I might have been too hard sometimes on any one,\nor whether I might have forgotten to think of the Lord, upon any Sunday.\nAnd then my thoughts were elevated to the two dear children.\n\nNow what do you think happened to me, when I thought of those two\ndarlings, and the tears from smoke made way for the deep-born tears of a\nnoble heart? Why simply that a flash of flame glanced upon the iron\ncrowbar, wherewith I had opened hatch. I could not have been in pure\nbright possession of my Maker\'s gifts to me when I chanced, before going\nto bed, to lay that crowbar for my pillow-case. Nevertheless I had done\nit well: and in the stern perception of this desperate extremity, I\ncould not help smiling at the way I had tucked up my head on the\ncrowbar. But (though no time is lost in smiling) I had not a moment to\nlose even now, although with my utmost wits all awake and coughing. I\nprised the hatch up in half a moment, where it was stuck in the\ncombings; and if ever a man enjoyed a draught, I did so of air that\nmoment. Many men might have been frightened still, and not have known\nwhat to do with themselves. But I assure you, in all honour, that the\nwhole of my mind came back quite calmly, when I was out of smothering.\nPeople may say what they like; but I know, after seeing every form of\ndeath (and you need not laugh at me very much, if I even said feeling\nit)--I know no anguish to be compared to the sense of being pressed\nunder slowly; and the soul with no room to get away.\n\nBut I was under the good stars now, and able to think and to look about;\nand though the ketch could not last long, being of 92 tons only, I found\ntime enough to kneel and thank my God for His mercy to me. There was no\nice in the river now, and to swim ashore would have been but little,\nexcept for rheumatics afterwards. But it seemed just as well to escape\neven these; and having been burned out at sea before, I was better\nenabled to manage it. The whole of the waist of the ketch was in flames,\ncurling and beginning now to indulge their desire of roaring; but the\nkindness of the Lord prevented wind from blowing. Had there been only a\nfour-knot breeze, you would never have heard of me again; surely which\nwould grieve you.\n\nIn this very sad state of mind, combined with a longing for\nthankfulness, and while I was thinking about the fire--to say the truth,\nvery stupidly, and wondering instead of working--quite an old-fashioned\naffair restored me to my wits and my love of the world again. This was\nthe strong sour sound of the air when a bullet comes through it hastily,\nand casting reproach upon what we breathe, for its want of a stronger\nactivity. A man had made a shot at me, and must have been a lubber by\nhis want of range and common-sense. Before I could think, I was all\nalive, and fit to enjoy myself almost, as if it were a fight with\nFrenchmen. The first thing I thought of was the gun lent to me by Miss\nCarey. To rescue this, I went down even into the cuddy which had so\nlately proved my very grave almost; and after this I saw no reason why I\nshould not save my money, if the Lord so willed it. From a sense of all\nthe mischief even now around me, I had made a clever hole in the\nbow-knees of the ketch (where the wood lay thickest), and so had plugged\nmy money up, with the power to count it daily. And now in spite of\nflame, and roar, and heat of all the \'midships, and the spluttering of\nthe rock-powder bags too wet to be unanimous, I made my mind up just to\ntry to save my bit of money.\n\nBecause, although a man may be as coarse, and wicked, and vile-hearted,\nas even my very worst enemies are, he cannot fail of getting on, and\nbeing praised, and made the best of, if he only does his best to stick\ntight to his money. Therefore, having no boat within reach, and the\n\'midship all aflame, I made a raft of the cuddy-hatch, and warped along\nby the side of the ketch, and purchased my cash from its little nest;\nand then with a thankful heart, and nothing but a pair of breeches on,\nmade the best of my way ashore, punting myself with a broken oar.\n\nThis desire to sacrifice me (without the trouble even taken to count\nwhat my value was) gave me such a sense of shock, and of spreading\nabroad everywhere, without any knowledge left of what might have become\nof me, and the subject liable to be dropped, if ever entered into by a\nJolly Crowner, and a jury glad to please him, that for the moment I\nsate down upon a shelf of clay, until the wet came through my want of\nclothes. Suddenly this roused me up to make another trial for the sake\nof my well-accustomed and familiar suit of clothes, so well beloved;\nalso even my Sunday style, more striking but less comfortable; in lack\nof which the world could never have gone on in our neighbourhood.\nTherefore I ran to my little punt, and pushed off and was just in time\nto save my kit, with a little singeing.\n\nThe ketch burned down to the water\'s edge, and then a rough tide came up\nand sank her, leaving me in a bitter plight, and for some time quite\nuncertain how to face the future. From knowledge of the Parson\'s style\nof treating similar cases, I felt it to be a most likely thing that I\nshould be charged with firing her, robbing her, and concealing booty.\nAnd this injustice added to the bitterness of my close escape. ""It is no\nuse,"" I said aloud; ""it is useless to contend with him. He has sold\nhimself to Satan, and, thank God, I have no chance with him."" Therefore\nby the time the fire had created some disturbance in the cottage\nbedrooms, I had got my clothing on, in a decent though hasty manner, and\nslipped into a little wood with my spy-glass, happily saved, and\nresolved to watch what happened in among the bumpkins.\n\nThese came down, and stared and gawked, and picked up bits of singed\nspars, and so on, and laid down the law to one another, and fought for\nthe relics, and thought it hard that no man\'s body was to be found with\nclothes on. I saw them hunting for me, up and down the river channel,\nwith a desperate ignorance of tide (although living so close to it), and\nI did not like to have my body hunted for like that. But I repressed all\nfiner feelings, as a superior man must do, and chewed the tip of a\nbullock\'s tongue, which luckily was in my waistcoat-pocket, ready for\ngreat emergency; and which, if a man keeps going on with, he may go,\nlike the great Elijah, forty days, and feel no hunger. At least, I have\nheard so, and can believe it, having seen men who told me so; but I\nwould rather have it proved by another man\'s experience.\n\nWhile I was looking on at these things, down came Parson Chowne himself,\nin a happy mood, and riding the black mare, now brought out of dock\nagain. The country folk all fell away from their hope of stealing\nsomething, and laid fingers to their hats, being afraid to talk of him.\nHe, however, did no more than sign to the serving-man behind him, to\nacknowledge compliments (which was outside his own custom), and then he\nput spurs to his horse and galloped right and left through the lot of\nthem. In my anxiety to learn what this dreadful man was up to, I slipped\ndown through the stubs of the wood, where the faggot-cutters had been at\nwork, gliding even upon my jersey, because of the Parson\'s piercing\neyes, and there in the ditch I found some shelter, and spied through a\nbushy breastwork.\n\n""No more than I expected,"" he cried, ""from what I have seen of the\nfellow; he has fired the ship, and run away with all he could lay hands\non. As a Justice of the Peace, I offer ten pounds reward for David\nLlewellyn, brought before me, alive or dead. Is there one of you\nrantipoles can row? Oh, you can. Take this shilling, and be off with\nthat big thief\'s ferry-boat, and leave it at Sam Tucker\'s shipyard, in\nthe name of the Reverend Stoyle Chowne.""\n\nIt went to my heart that none of the people to whom I had been so ""good\nand kind""--to use pretty Bardie\'s phrase--now had the courage to stand\nup, and say that my character was most noble, and claim back my boat for\nme. Instead of that, they all behaved as if I had never ferried them;\nand the ingratitude of the young women made me long to be in Wales\nagain. Because, you may say what you like; but the first point in our\npeople is gratitude.\n\n""Of course,"" cried Chowne, and his voice, though gently used, came down\nthe wind like a bell; ""of course, good people, you have not found the\ncorpse of that wretched villain.""\n\n""Us would giv\' un up, glad enough, if us only gat the loock, for tan\nzhilling, your Raverance. Lave aloun tan poond.""\n\nWhen that miserable miser said a thing so low as that, my very flesh\ncrept on my bones, and my inmost heart was sick with being made so very\nlittle of. To myself I always had a proper sense of estimation; and to\nbe put at this low figure made me doubt of everything. However, I came\nto feel, after a bit, that this is one of the trials which all good men\nmust put up with: neither would a common man find his corpse worth ten\npounds sterling.\n\nBetwixt my sense of public value (a definite sum, at any rate) and\nimagination of what my truly natural abilities might lead me to, if\nproperly neglected, I found it a blessed hard thing to lie quiet until\ndark, and then slip out. And the more so, because my stock of food was\nall consumed by middle day; and before the sun went down, hunger of a\ngreat shape and size arose and raged within me. This is always\ndifficult to discipline or to reason with; and to men of the common\norder it suggests great violence. To me it did nothing of that kind, but\nled me into a little shop, where I paid my money, and got my loaf. My\nflint and steel and tinder-box lay in my pocket handy. These I felt and\nfelt again, and went into the woods and thought, and found that even\nwant of food had failed to give me a thorough-going and consistent\nappetite. Because, for the first time in my life, I had shaped a strong\nresolve, and sworn to the Lord concerning it--to commit a downright\ncrime, and one which I might be hanged for. Although every one who has\nentered into my sufferings and my dignity must perceive how right I was,\nand would never inform against me, I will only say that on Saturday\nevening Parson Chowne had fourteen ricks, and on Sunday morning he had\nnone, and might begin to understand the feelings of the many farmers who\nhad been treated thus by him. Right gladly would I have beheld his face\n(so rigid and contemptuous at other people\'s trouble) when he should\ncome to contemplate his own works thus brought home to him. But I could\nnot find a hedge thick enough to screen me from his terrible piercing\neyes.\n\nThis little bit of righteous action made a stir, you may be sure,\nbecause it was so contrary to the custom of the neighbourhood. Although\nI went to see this fire, I took the finest care to leave no evidence\nbehind me; and even turned my bits of toggery inside out at starting.\nBut there was a general sense in among these people, that only a\nforeigner could have dared to fly in the Parson\'s face so. I waited long\nenough to catch the turn of the public feeling, and finding it set hard\nagainst me, my foremost thought was the love of home.\n\nKeeping this in view, and being pressed almost beyond bearing now, with\nno certainty, moreover, as to warrants coming out, and the people\nlooking strangely, every time they met me, I could have no peace until I\nsaw the beautiful young lady, and to her told everything. You should\nhave seen her eyes and cheeks, as well as the way her heart went; and\nthe pride with which she gathered all her meaning up to speak; even\nafter I had told her how the ricks would burn themselves.\n\n""You dear old Davy,"" she said, ""I never thought you had so much courage.\nYou are the very bravest man--but stop, did you burn the whole of them?""\n\n""Every one burned itself, your ladyship; I saw the ashes dying down, and\nhis summer-house as well took fire, through the mischief of the wind,\nand all his winter stock of wood, and his tool-house, and his----""\n\n""Any more, any more, old David?""\n\n""Yes, your ladyship, his cow-house, after the cows were all set free,\nand his new cart-shed fifty feet long, also his carpenter\'s shop, and\nhis cider-press.""\n\n""You are the very best man,"" she answered, with her beautiful eyes full\nupon me, ""that I have seen, since I was a child. I must think what to do\nfor you. Did you burn anything more, old Davy?""\n\n""The fire did, your ladyship, three large barns, and a thing they call a\n\'linhay;\' also the granary, and the meal-house, and the apple-room, and\nthe churn-room, and only missed the dairy by a little nasty slant of\nwind.""\n\n""What a good thing you have done! There is scarcely any man I know, that\nwould have shown such courage. Mr Llewellyn, is there anything in my\npower to do for you?""\n\nNothing could have pleased me more than to find this fair young lady\nrejoicing in this generous manner at the Parson\'s misadventure. And her\ndelight in the contemplation made me almost feel repentance at the\ndelicate forbearance of the flames from the Rectory itself. But I could\nnot help reflecting how intense and bitter must be this young harmless\ncreature\'s wrong received and dwelling in her mind, ere she could find\npleasure from wild havoc and destruction.\n\n""There is one thing you can do,"" I answered very humbly; ""and it is my\nonly chance to escape from misconstruction. I never thought, at my time\nof life, to begin life so again. But I am now a homeless man, burned out\nof my latest refuge, and with none to care for me. Perhaps I may be\ntaken up to-morrow, or the next day. And with such a man against me, it\nmust end in hanging.""\n\n""I never heard such a thing,"" she said: ""he tries to burn you in your\nbed, after blowing you up, and doing his very best to drown you; and\nthen you are to be hanged because there is a bonfire on his premises! It\nis impossible, Mr Llewellyn, to think twice of such a thing.""\n\n""Your ladyship may be right,"" I answered; ""and in the case of some one\nelse, reasoning would convince me. But if I even stop to think twice, it\nwill lead to handcuffs; and handcuffs lead to halter.""\n\nAt this she began to be frightened much, and her fright grew worse, as I\ndescribed the unpleasantness of hanging; how I had helped myself to run\nup nine good men at the yard-arm. And a fine thing for their souls, no\ndoubt, to stop them from more mischief, and let them go up while the\nLord might think that other men had injured them.\n\n""Your ladyship,"" I began again, when I saw all her delicate colour\nebbing; ""it is not for a poor hunted man to dare to beg a favour.""\n\n""Oh yes, it is, it is,"" she cried; ""that is the very time to do it.\nAnything in my power, David, after all you have done for me.""\n\n""Then all that I want of your ladyship is to get me rated aboard of\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde\'s ship.""\n\nShe coloured up so clearly that I was compelled to look away: and then\nshe said--\n\n""How do you know--I mean who can have told you that--but are you not\ntoo--perhaps a little----""\n\n""Too old, your ladyship? Not a day. I am worth half-a-dozen of those\nyoung chips who have got no bones to their legs yet. And as for\nshooting, if his Honour wants a man to train a cannon, I can hit a\nmarlinspike with a round-shot, at a mile and a half, as soon as I learn\nthe windage.""\n\nFor I knew by this time that Captain Bampfylde\'s ship, the Alcestis, was\nin reserve, as a feeder for the Royal Navy, to catch young hands and\ntrain them to some knowledge of sealife, and smartness, and the styles\nof gunnery. And who could teach them these things better than a veteran\nlike me?\n\nMiss Carey smiled at my conceit, as perhaps she considered it; ""Well,\nDavy, if you can fire a gun, as well as you can a hay-rick----""\n\n""No more, your ladyship, I beseech you. Even walls like these have ears;\nand every time I see my shadow, I take it for a constable. I am sure\nthere are two men after me----""\n\n""Have you then two shadows?"" she asked, in her peculiar pleasant way:\n""at any rate no one will dare to meddle with you, or any of us, I should\nhope, in the General\'s own house. Come in here. I expect, or at least I\nthink, there is some prospect of a boat from the Alcestis coming up the\nriver this very evening. Perhaps you have some baggage.""\n\n""No, your ladyship, not a bit. They burned me out of all of it. But I\nsaved some money kindly, by special grace of God, at the loss of all my\nleg-hair.""\n\nI ought not to have said that, I knew, directly after uttering it, to a\nyoung lady who could not yet be up to things of that kind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE.\n\n\nThe very next day, I was afloat as a seaman of the Royal Navy of the\nUnited Kingdom. None but a sailor can imagine what I felt and what I\nthought. Here for years I had been adrift from the very work God shaped\nme for, wrecked before my time by undue violence of a Frenchman. Also I\nhad bred my son up to supply my place a little; and a very noble fellow,\nthough he could not handle cutlash or lay gun as I had done. But he\nmight have come to it if he ever had come to my own time of life. This\nhowever had been cut short by the will of Providence; and now I felt\nbound to make good for it. Only one thing grieved me, viz., to find the\nwar declining. This went to my heart the more, because our Navy had not\ndone according to its ancient fame, anywhere but at Gibraltar and with\nAdmiral Rodney, in the year before I rejoined it. Off the coast of\nAmerica, things I could not bear to hear; also the loss of the Royal\nGeorge, the capture of the Leeward Islands, and of Minorca by the\nFrench; and even a British sloop of war taken by a French corvette. Such\nthings moved me to the marrow, after all I had seen and done; and all\nour ship\'s company understood that I returned to the service in the hope\nto put a stop to it. This reclaiming of me to the thing that I was meant\nfor took less time than I might use to bring a gun to its bearings. That\nbeautiful Miss Carey managed everything with Captain Drake, and in less\nthan fifty kisses they had settled my affairs. I could have no more\nself-respect, if I said another word.\n\nBut the King and the nation won the entire benefit of this. It came to\npass that I was made a second-instructor in gunnery, with an entire new\nkit found me, and six-and-twopence a-week appointed, together with\nsecond right to stick a fork into the boiler. Of course I could not have\nwon all this by favour; but showed merit. It had however been allowed\nme, under an agreement (just enough, yet brought about by special love\nof justice) that I should receive a month ashore at Newton-Nottage, in\nthe course of the spring, whenever it might suit our cruising. My\nprivate affairs demanded this; as well as love of neighbours, and\nstrong desire to let them know how much they ought to make of me.\n\nHow I disdained my rod and pole, and the long-shore life and the\nlubberly ways, when I felt once more the bounding of the open water, the\nspring of the buoyant timbers answering every movement gallantly, the\ngenerous vehemence of the canvas, and the noble freedom of the ocean\nwinds around us! The rush up a liquid mountain, and the sway on the\nbalance of the world, then the plunge into the valley, almost out of the\nsight of God, though we feel Him hovering over us. While the heart leaps\nwith the hope of yet more glorious things to come--the wild delight, the\nrage, suspense, and majesty of battle.\n\nNothing vexed me now so much as to hear from private people, and even\nfrom the public sailors, that the nation wanted peace. No nation ever\nshould want peace, until it has thoroughly thrashed the other, or is\nbound by wicked luck to knock under hopelessly. And neither of those\nthings had befallen England at this period. But I have not skill enough\nto navigate in politics. And before we had been long at sea, we spoke a\nfull-rigged ship from Hamburg, which had touched at Falmouth; and two\nGerman boys, in training for the British Navy, let us know that peace\nwas signed between Great Britain, France, and Spain, as nearly as might\nbe on Valentine\'s Day of the year 1783. A sad and hard thing we found to\nbelieve it, and impossible to be pleased after such practice of gunnery.\n\nNevertheless it was true enough, and confirmed by another ship; and now\na new Ministry was in office under a man of the name of Fox, doubtless\nof that nature also, ready always to run to earth. Nothing more could be\nhoped except to put up with all degradation. A handful of barbarous\nfellows, wild in the woods and swamps of America, most of them sent from\nthis home-country through their contempt of discipline, fellows of this\nsort had been able (mainly by skulking and shirking fight) to elude and\nget the better of His Britannic Majesty\'s forces, and pretend to set up\non their own account, as if they could ever get on so. No one who sees\nthese things as clearly as I saw them then and there, can doubt as to\nthe call I felt to rejoin the Royal Navy.\n\nOf course I could not dream that now there was rising in a merchant-ship\ncaptured from the Frenchmen, and fitted with two dozen guns, a British\nCaptain such as never had been seen before, nor will ever be again; and\nwhose skill and daring left the Frenchmen one hope only--to run ashore,\nand stay there.\n\nHowever, not to dwell too long on the noblest and purest motives, it did\nnot take me quite three weeks to supersede the first instructor, and to\nget him sent ashore, and find myself hoisted into his berth, with a rise\nof two-and-two per week. This gave me eight-and-fourpence, with another\nstripe on my right arm, and what was far more to the purpose, added\ngreatly to the efficiency of the British Navy. Because the man was very\nwell, or at any rate well enough, in his way and in his manners, and\nquite worth his wages; but to see him train a gun, and to call him First\nInstructor! Captain Bampfylde saw, in twenty minutes, that I could shoot\nthis fine fellow\'s head off, unwilling as I was to give offence, and\ndelicate about priming. And all the men felt at once the power of a\npractised hand set over them. I saw that the Navy had fallen back very\nmuch in the matter of gunnery, in the time of the twenty years, or so,\nsince I had been Gun-captain; and it came into my head to show them many\nthings forgotten. The force of nature carried me into this my proper\nposition; and the more rapidly, because it happened to occur to me that\nhere was the very man pointed out, as it were by the hand of Providence,\nfor Parson Chowne to blow up next. Our Captain had the very utmost\nconfidence that could be in him, and he stood on his legs with a breadth\nthat spoke to the strength of his constitution; a man of enduring\ngravity. Also his weight was such that the Parson never could manage to\nblow him up, with any powder as yet admitted into the Royal Dockyards. I\nliked this man, and I let him know it; but I thought it better for him\nto serve his country on shore a little, after being so long afloat; if\n(as I put it to his conscience) he could keep from poaching, and from\nfiring stackyards, or working dangerous ferries. He told me that he had\nno temptation towards what I had mentioned; but on the other hand felt\ninclined, after so many years at sea, to have a family of his own; and a\nwife, if found consistent. This I assured him I could manage; and in a\nfew words did so; asking for nothing more on his part than entire\nconfidence. My nature commanded this from him; and we settled to\nexchange our duties in a pleasant manner. I gave him introduction to the\nliveliest of the farmers\' daughters, telling him what their names were.\nAnd being over-full of money, he paid me half-a-crown apiece, for\nthirteen girls to whom I gave him letters of commendation. This was far\ntoo cheap, with all of them handsomer than he had any right to; and\nthree of them only daughters, and two with no more than grandmothers.\nBut I love to help a fellow-sailor; and thus I got rid of him. For our\nCaptain had the utmost faith in this poor man\'s discretion, and had\nthought, before I said it, of laying him up at Narnton Court, to keep a\ngeneral look-out, because his eyes were failing. I did not dare to offer\nmore opinion than was asked for, but it struck me that if Parson Chowne\nhad been too clever for David Llewellyn, and made the place too hot for\nhim, he was not likely to be outwitted by Naval Instructor Heaviside.\n\nHowever, I could not see much occasion for Chowne to continue his plots\nany longer, or even to keep watch on the house, unless it were from\njealousy of our Captain\'s visits. As far as any one might fathom that\nunfathomable Parson, he had two principal ends in view. The first was to\nget possession of Miss Carey and all her property, by making her Mrs\nChowne, No. 4; the second, which would help him towards the first, was\nto keep up against poor Captain Drake the horrible charge of having\nkilled those two children, whose burial had been seen as before related.\nAnd here I may mention what I had forgotten, through entire want of\nvindictive feeling--to wit, that I had, as a matter of duty, contrived\nto thrash very heavily both of those fellows on Braunton Burrows, who\nhad been spying on Narnton Court, and committed such outrages against\nme. Without doing this, I could not have left the county\nconscientiously.\n\nAnd now on board the Alcestis, a rattling fine frigate of 44 guns, it\ngave me no small pleasure to find that (although the gunnery-practice\nwas not so good as I was accustomed to), in seamanship, and discipline,\nand general smartness, there was little to be reasonably complained of;\nespecially when it was borne in mind what our special duty was, and why\nwe were kept in commission when so many other ships were paid off, at\nthe conclusion of the war. Up to that time the Alcestis had orders to\ncruise off the western coasts, not only on account of some French\nprivateers, which had made mischief with our shipping, but also as a\ndraft-ship for receiving and training batches of young hands, who were\ntransferred, as occasion offered, to Halifax, or the West Indies\nstation. And now as the need for new forces ceased, Captain Drake was\nbeginning to expect orders for Spithead to discharge. Instead of that,\nhowever, the Admiralty had determined to employ this ship, which had\ndone so much in the way of education, for the more thorough settlement\nof a question upon which they differed from the general opinion of the\nNavy, and especially of the Ordnance Board. This was concerning the\nvalue of a new kind of artillery invented by a clever Scotchman, and\ncalled a ""Carronade,"" because it was cast at certain iron-works on the\nbanks of the river Carron. This gun is now so thoroughly well known and\napproved, and has done so much to help us to our recent triumphs, that I\nneed not stop to describe it, although at first it greatly puzzled me.\nIt was so short, and light, and handy, and of such large caliber,\nmoreover with a great chamber for the powder, such as a mortar has, that\nat first it quite upset me, knowing that I must appear familiar, yet not\nbeing so. However, I kept in the background, and nodded and shook my\nhead so that every one misunderstood me differently.\n\nThat night I arose and studied it, and resolved to back it up, because\nonly Captain Drake was in its favour, and the first-lieutenant.\nHeaviside was against it strongly, although he said that six months ago\nthe Rainbow, an old 44, being refitted with nothing else but carronades\nof large caliber, had created such terror in a French ship of almost\nequal force, that she fired a broadside of honour, and then surrendered\nto the Rainbow. But to come back to our Alcestis, at the time I was\npromoted to first place in gunnery. Over and above her proper armament\nof long guns, eighteen and twelve pounders, she carried on the\nquarter-deck six 24-pounder carronades, and two of 18 in the forecastle.\nSo that in truth she had fifty-two guns, and was a match in weight of\nmetal for a French ship of sixty guns, as at that time fitted.\nAfterwards it was otherwise; and their artillery outweighed ours, as\nmuch as a true Briton outweighs them.\n\nNow Naval Instructor Mr Llewellyn had such a busy time of it, and was\nfound so indispensable on board the Alcestis, that I do assure you they\ncould not spare him for even a glimpse of old Newton-Nottage, until the\nbeginning of the month of May. But as I always find that people become\nloose in their sense of duty, unless girt up well with money (even as\nthe ancients used to carry their cash in their girdles), I had taken\nadvantage of a run ashore at Pembroke, to send our excellent Parson\nLougher a letter containing a Â£5 note, as well as a few words about my\npresent position, authority, and estimation. I trusted to him as a\ngentleman not to speak of those last matters to any untrustworthy\nperson whatever; because there would be six months\' pension falling due\nto me at Swansea, at the very time of writing; and which of course I\nmeant to have; for my zeal in overlooking my wound could not replace me\nunwounded, I trow. But knowing our Government to be thoroughly versed in\nevery form of stinginess and peculation (which was sure to be doubled\nnow a Fox was in), I thought that they might even have the dishonesty to\ndeny me my paltry pittance on account of ancient merit and great valour,\nupon the shabby plea that now I was on full pay again! They would have\ndone so, I do believe, if their own clumsy and careless ways had allowed\nthem to get scent of it. But they do things so stupidly, that a clever\nman need never allow them to commit roguery upon him. And by means of\ndiscreet action, I was enabled for fourteen years to draw the pension I\nhad won so nobly, as well as the pay I was earning so grandly. However,\nthese are trifles.\n\nThe Â£5 note was for Mother Jones, to help our Bunny with spring-clothes,\nand to lay out at her discretion for my grandchild\'s benefit, supposing\n(as I must needs suppose) that Churchwarden Morgan, in face of his\npromise, would refuse indignantly to accept a farthing for the child\'s\nnourishment. He disappointed me, however, by accepting four pound ten,\nand Mrs Jones was quite upset; for even Bunny never could have eaten\nthat much in the time. Charles was a worthy man enough (as undertakers\nalways are), but it was said that he could not do according to his\nlights, when fancy brought his wife across them. Poor Mother Jones was\nso put out, that she quite forgot what she was doing until she had spent\nthe ten shillings of change in drawers for her middle children. And so\npoor Bunny got nothing at all; nor even did poorer Bardie. For this\nlittle dear I had begged to be bought, for the sake of her vast\nimagination, nothing less than a two-shilling doll, jointed both at knee\nand elbow, as the Dutchmen turn them out. It was to be naked (like\nParson Chowne\'s folk), but with the girls at the well stirred up to make\nit more becoming. And then Mother Jones was to go to Sker, and in my\nname present it.\n\nAll things fail, unless a man himself goes and looks after them. And so\nmy Â£5 note did; and when I was able to follow it, complaint was too\nlate, as usual. But you should have seen the village on the day when our\nCaptain Drake--as we delighted to call him--found himself for the first\ntime able to carry out his old promise to me, made beneath the very\neyes of his true-love, Isabel. The thought of this had long been chafing\nin between his sense of honour, and of duty set before him by the\npresent Naval Board. And but for his own deeper troubles, though I did\nmy best for ease, he must have felt discomfort. If I chose, I could give\nmany tokens of what he thought of me, not expressed, nor even hinted;\nyet to my mind palpable. But as long as our Navy lasts, no man will dare\nto intrude on his Captain.\n\nBe it enough, and it was enough, that his Majesty\'s 44-gun ship Alcestis\nbrought up, as near as her draught allowed, to Porthcawl Point, on the\n5th of May 1783. This was by no means my desire, because it went against\nmy nature to exhibit any grandeur. And I felt in my heart the most warm\ndesire that Master Alexander Macraw might happen to be from home that\nday. Nothing could have grieved me more, than for a man of that small\nnature to behold me stepping up in my handsome uniform, with all the\noars saluting me, and the second-lieutenant in the stern-sheets crying,\n""Farewell, Mr David!"" also officership marked upon every piece of my\nclothes in sight; and the dignity of my bearing not behind any one of\nthem. But as my evil luck would have it, there was poor Sandy Mac\nhimself, and more half-starved than ever. Such is the largeness of my\nnature, that I sank all memory of wrongs, and upon his touching his hat\nto me I gave him an order for a turbot, inasmuch as my clothes were now\ntoo good, and my time too valuable, to permit of my going fishing.\n\nThis, however, was nothing at all, compared with what awaited me among\nthe people at the well. All Newton was assembled there to welcome and\ncongratulate me, and most of them called me ""Captain Llewellyn,"" and\nevery one said I looked ten years younger in my handsome uniform. I gave\nmyself no airs whatever--that I leave for smaller men--but entered so\nheartily into the shaking of hands, that if I had been a pump, the well\nbeneath us must have gone quite dry. But all this time I was looking for\nBunny, who was not among them; and presently I saw short legs of a size\nand strength unparalleled, except by one another, coming at a mighty\npace down the yellow slope of sand, and scattering the geese on the\nsmall green patches. Mrs Morgan had kept her to smarten up,--and really\nshe was a credit to them, so clean, and bright, and rosy-faced. At first\nshe was shy of my grand appearance; but we very soon made that right.\n\nNow I will not enlarge upon or even hint at the honour done me for\nhaving done such honour to my native place, because as yet I had done\nbut little, except putting that coat on, to deserve it. Enough that I\ndrew my salary for attending to the old church clock, also my pension at\nSwansea, and was feasted and entertained, and became for as long as\ncould be expected the hero of the neighbourhood. And I found that Mother\nJones had kept my cottage in such order, that after a day or two I was\nable to go to Sker for the purpose of begging the favour of a visit from\nBardie.\n\nBut first, as in duty bound, of course, I paid my respects to Colonel\nLougher. As luck would have it, both the worthy Colonel and Lady Bluett\nwere gone from home; but my old friend Crumpy, their honest butler,\nkindly invited me in, and gave me an excellent dinner in his own pantry;\nbecause he did not consider it proper that an officer of the Royal Navy\nshould dine with the maids in the kitchen, however unpretending might be\nhis behaviour. And here, while we were exchanging experience over a fine\nold cordial, in bursts the Honourable Rodney, without so much as\nknocking at the door. Upon seeing me his delight was such that I could\nforgive him anything; and his admiration of my dress, when I stood up\nand made the salute to him, proved that he was born a sailor. A fine\nyoung fellow he was as need be, in his twelfth year now, and come on a\nmitching expedition from the great grammar-school at Cowbridge. To drink\nhis health, both Crumpy and myself had courage for another glass; and\nwhen I began to tell sea-stories, with all the emphasis and expression\nflowing out of my uniform, he was so overpowered that he insisted on a\nhornpipe. This, although it might be now considered under dignity, I\ncould not refuse as a mark of respect for him, and for the service; and\nwhen I had executed, as perhaps no other man can, this loyal and\ninimitable dance, his feelings were carried away so strongly that he\noffered all the money left him by a course of schoolwork (and amounting\nto fourpence-halfpenny) if I would only agree to smuggle him on board\nour Alcestis, when she should come to fetch me.\n\nThis, of course, I could not think of, even for a hundred pounds; and\nmuch as I longed for the boy to have the play of his inclination. And in\nthe presence of Crumpy too, who with all his goodwill to me, would be\nsure to give evidence badly, if his young master were carried away! And\nunder such love and obligation to the noble Colonel, I behaved as a man\nshould do, when having to deal with a boyish boy; that is to say, I told\nhis guardians on the next opportunity.\n\nBut to break away at once from all these trifling matters, only one day\ncame to pass before I went for Bardie. All along the sea-coast I was\ngoing very sadly; half in hopes, but more in fear, because I had bad\nnews of her. What little they could tell at Newton was that Delushy was\nalmost dead, by means of a dreadful whooping-cough, all throughout the\nwinter, and the small caliber of her throat. And Charles Morgan had no\nmore knowledge of my warm feeling thitherway, than to show me that he\nhad been keeping some boards of sawn and seasoned elm, two feet six in\nlength, and in breadth ten inches, from what he had heard about her\nhealth, and the likelihood of her measurement. When I heard this, you\nmight knock me down, in spite of all my uniform, with a tube of\nmacaroni. People have a foolish habit, when a man comes home again, of\nkeeping all the bad news from him, and pushing forward all the good. If\nthis had not been done to me, I never could have slept a wink, ere going\nto Sker Manor.\n\nTo me that old house always seemed even more desolate and forlorn with\nthe summer sunshine on it, than in the fogs and storms of winter;\nperhaps from the bareness of the sandhills, and the rocks, and\ndry-stone walls, showing more in the brightness, and when woods and\nbanks are fairest. I looked in vain for a moving creature; there seemed\nto be none for miles around, except a sullen cormorant sleeping far away\nat sea. Only little Dutch was howling in some lonely corner slowly, as\nwhen her five young masters died.\n\nAs I approached the door in fear of being too late to say good-bye to my\npretty little one, yet trying to think how well it might be for her poor\nyoung life to flutter to some guardian angel, my old enemy Black Evan\nstood and barred the way for me. I doubt if he knew me, at first sight;\nand beyond any doubt at all, I never should have known him, if I had\nchanced to meet him elsewhere. For I had not set eyes on his face from\nthe day when he frightened us so at the Inquest; and in those ten\nmonths, what a change from rugged strength to decrepitude!\n\n""You cannot see any one in this house,"" he said very quietly, and of\ncourse in Welsh; ""every one is very busy, and in great trouble every\none.""\n\n""Evan Black, I feel sorrow for you. And have felt it, through all your\ntroubles. Take the hand of a man who has come with goodwill, and to help\nyou.""\n\nHe put out his hand, and its horn was gone. I found it flabby, cold, and\ntrembling. A year ago he had been famous for crushing everything in his\npalm.\n\n""You cannot help us; neither can any man born of a woman,"" he answered,\nwith his black eyes big with tears: ""it is the will of the Lord to slay\nall whom He findeth dear to me.""\n\n""Is Delushy dead?"" I asked, with a great sob rising in my throat, like\nwadding rammed by an untaught man.\n\n""The little sweetheart is not yet dead; but she cannot live beyond the\nday. She lies panting with lips open. What food has she taken for five\ndays?""\n\nAny one whose nature leads him to be moved by little things, would have\nbeen distressed at seeing such a most unlucky creature finishing her\ntender days in that quiet childish manner, among strangers\' tenderness.\nIn her weak, defeated state, with all her clever notions gone, she lay\nwith a piece of striped flannel round her, the lips, that used to\nprattle so, now gasping for another breath, and the little toes that\ndanced so, limp, and frail, and feebly twitching. The tiny frame was too\nworn to cough, and could only shudder faintly, when the fit came through\nit. Yet I could see that the dear little eyes looked at me, and tried to\nsay to the wandering wits that it was Old Davy; and the helpless tongue\nmade effort to express that love of beauty, which had ever seemed to be\nthe ruling baby passion. The crown and stripes upon my right arm were\ndone in gold--at my own expense, for Government only allowed yellow\nthread. Upon these her dim eyes fastened, with a pleasure of surprise;\nand though she could not manage it, she tried to say, ""How boofely!""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nTHE LITTLE MAID, AND THE MIDSHIPMAN.\n\n\nIn this sad predicament, I looked from one to other of them, hoping for\nsome counsel. There was Moxy, crying quite as if it were her own child\nalmost; and there was Peggy the milking-maid, allowed to offer her\nopinion (having had a child, although not authorised to produce one);\nalso myself in uniform, and Black Evan coming up softly, with a\nnewly-discovered walk. And yet not one had a word to say except ""poor\nlittle dear!"" sometimes; and sometimes, ""we must trust in God.""\n\n""I tell you,"" I cried; ""that never does. And I never knew good come of\nit. A man\'s first place is to trust to himself, and to pray to the Lord\nto help him. Have you nothing more to say?""\n\n""Here be all her little things,"" Black Evan whispered to his wife; ""put\nthem ready to go with her."" His two great hands were full of little odds\nand ends which she had gathered in her lonely play along the beach, and\non the sandhills.\n\n""Is that all that you can do? Watkin could do more than that. And now\nwhere is young Watkin?""\n\nThey assured me there was no more to do. They were tired of trying\neverything. As for Watkin, he it was who had brought the malady into the\nhouse, and now they had sent him for change of air to an uncle he had at\nLlynvi. Concerning Delushy, there was nothing for her to do, but to die,\nand to go to heaven.\n\n""She shan\'t die, I tell you,"" I cried out strongly: ""you are a set of\nhopeless ones. Twice have I saved her life before, when I was only a\nfisherman. I am a man in authority now; and please God, I am just in\ntime to save her life, once more, my friends. Do you give her up, you\nstupids?""\n\nThey plainly thought that I was gone mad, by reason of my rise in life;\nand tenfold sure of it they were, when I called for a gown of red\nPembrokeshire flannel, belonging to Moxy for ten years now. However poor\nMoxy herself went for it; and I took the child out of her stuffy bed,\nand the hot close room containing it, and bore her gently in my arms\nwith the red flannel round her, and was shocked to find how light she\nwas. Down the great staircase I took her, and then feeling her breath\nstill going, and even a stir of her toes, as if the life was coming back\nto her, what did I do but go out of doors, into the bright May sunshine?\nI held her uncommon and clearly-shaped face on my bosom, to front the\nsunlight, and her long eyelashes lifted, and her small breast gave three\nsighs.\n\n""Good-bye all of you,"" I cried: ""she comes away with me this minute.\nPeggy may come, if she likes, with half a sheep on her back to-morrow.""\n\nAnd so she did: and I could not give her less than half-a-crown for it;\nbecause of the difference and the grace of God to darling Bardie. In my\narms the whole way home, she lay like a new-born lamb almost, with her\nbreath overcome at first, and heavily drawn, while her eyes were waking.\nThen as the air of the open heaven found its way to her worn-out lungs,\ndown her quiet eyelids dropped, with a sleepy sense of happiness, and\nher weak lips dreamed of smiling, and her infant breast began to rise\nand fall quite steadily. And so she fell into a great deep sleep, and so\nI took her to my home, and the air of Newton saved her.\n\nOur Bunny was very good. There could hardly have been any better child,\nwhen her victuals were not invaded. She entered into Bardie\'s condition,\nand took quite a motherly attitude towards her. And while the tiny one\nlay so weak, Bunny felt that the lead of mind was hers for the present,\nand might be established by a vigorous policy. However in this point she\nwas wrong, or at any rate failed to work it out. In a fortnight Bardie\nwas mistress again; and poor Bunny had to trot after her.\n\nNow although it was very pleasant to see the thankfulness of Black Evan,\nwhen he came over every day, and brought his pockets full of things, and\ntried to look pleased when truthful Bardie refused downright to kiss\nhim; pleasant also for me to be begged not only to fish, but even to\nshoot--perhaps because now the wrong time of year--in and over and\nthrough a place, where the mere sight of my hat had been sure to lead to\na black eye under it; in despite of all these pleasures, I perceived\nthat business must be thoroughly attended to. And taking this view I was\nstrengthened in my own opinions, by the concurrence of every neighbour\npossessing a particle of sense. Not only Mother Jones--who might be\nhard, from so much family--but also the landlord of the Jolly quite\nagreed with the landlady, and even Crumpy, a man of the utmost\ntenderness ever known almost, and who must admire children, because he\nnever yet had owned any--all these authorities agreed that I must take\ncare what I was about. For my part, finding their opinions go beyond my\nown almost, or at any rate take a form of words different from my own,\nand having no assurance how it might end, I felt inclined to go back,\nand give fair-play to both sides of the argument.\n\nBut, as often happens when a man desires to see the right, and act\nstrictly up to it, the whole affair was interrupted, and my attention\ncalled away by another important matter, and the duties springing out of\nit. And this came to pass in the following manner. It happened upon\nOak-apple morning that I was down on a little sandhill, smoking a\npipe, and with both children building houses upon my pumps. These pumps\nhad lovely buckles of the very latest regulation; and it was a pleasure\nto regard them when at leisure, and reflect upon their quality, as well\nas signification. The children, however, took this matter from another\npoint of view; and there was scarcely anything to their little minds\nmore delightful than to obscure my pumps with sand, and put up a tower\nover them. And then if I moved, down came the whole; and instead of\nthemselves, they laughed at me. I had worked very hard in the Alcestis,\nand for almost a week after landing found it a most delicious thing,\nbecause so incomprehensible, to have nothing whatever to do. But long\nbefore now, I was tired of it, and yearned to put on my old slops again,\nand have a long day of fishing as if Bunny\'s life and mine hung on it.\nAnd when I gave a feast of turbot caught by that excellent Sandy Macraw\n(and paid for at just what he chose to charge), you would not have\nguessed it, but such were my feelings, that I only could make believe to\neat. And Sandy himself, by special desire, took the foot of the table,\nand went largely into everything; but behaved uncommonly well, for him.\n\nNow this is just the way I keep on going out of the proper track. If I\ncould not train a gun, much straighter than I can tell a story, France\nwould have conquered England, I believe, in spite of Nelson. It is the\nexcess of windage, coming down to me from great bards, which prevents my\nshot from flying point-blank, as it ought to do. Nevertheless the\nvillage children loved my style, especially since his Majesty had\nembellished me. And this was why I shunned the well, and sate among the\nsandhills; for really it was too hard to be expected to have in throat\na new story, never heard before, every time a little pitcher came on the\nhead of a little maid, to be filled, and then to go off again. Bardie\nand Bunny knew better than that, and never came for stories, till the\nproper time--the twilight.\n\nNow, as I was longing much to sacrifice all dignity, and throw off\ngold-lace and blue-cloth, and verily go at the congers (which I did the\nnext day, and defied the parish to think what it chose of me), I beheld\na pair of horses, with a carriage after them, coming in a lively manner\ntowards my nest of refuge.\n\n""It is useless now,"" I cried aloud; ""I can hope for no more peace.\nEverybody knows me, or believes it right to know me.""\n\nNevertheless, on the whole, I felt pleased, when I saw that the harness\nwas very bright, and the running-gear knopped with silver. And my\namazement was what you may enter into, when really the driver proved to\nbe no bigger than that little Master Rodney Bluett. He had the proper\ncoachman by his side, for fear of accidents; but to me, who had seen so\nmuch of horses now in Devonshire, it appeared a most rash thing to allow\nsuch a boy to navigate.\n\nHowever, having caught me thus, he jumped out without accident, while\nthe coachman touched his hat to me, or to his Majesty as now represented\nby me.\n\nThen that noble boy--as he ought no doubt to be entitled, being the son\nof a nobleman, although in common parlance styled an honourable boy,\nwhich to my mind is no more than a simple contradiction--up he ran with\nhis usual haste, expecting to find only Bunny and me. But his\nastonishment was worth seeing, on account of his being such a fair young\nchap, when suddenly he beheld poor Bardie, standing weakly on her legs\nnot quite re-established yet, and in her shy manner of inner doctrine\ntaking observation of him. A more free-and-easy schoolboy there could\nscarcely be than Rodney; and as for our Bunny, he used to toss her,\nuntil her weight overpowered him. But with this little lady looking so\npale, and drawn, and delicate, he knew (as if by instinct) that he must\nbegin very gingerly.\n\n""Captain Llewellyn,"" he said; ""I am come to tell you that my mind is\nquite made up. I mean to go to sea as soon as I can have my clothes\nmade.""\n\n""But, young sir,"" I answered, with a wish to humour this fine boy, yet a\ndesire to escape the noble Colonel\'s anger; ""it is useless now to go to\nsea. There is no war. We must wait, and trust the Lord to send one.""\n\n""And how shall I be fit to manage a ship, and fight our enemies, unless\nI begin at once, and practise, Captain Llewellyn?""\n\nIn this there was so much truth, as well as sense of discipline,\nmoreover such fine power of hope for another good bout at the French,\nthat I looked at my pocket-lappets for an answer; and found none.\n\n""I can stand a great deal,"" he cried; ""on account of my age, and so on.\nBut I can\'t stand Latin and Greek, and I cannot stand being put off\nalways. I know what they want me to do. They want me to grow too old for\nthe Navy! And I do believe they will manage it. I am getting twelve,\nevery day almost, and I can pull a pair of oars, and fire a cannon nine\ninches long, and sail a boat, if it doesn\'t blow.""\n\n""For all that I can answer, sir,"" my words were, being proud of him;\n""and you know who taught you this, and that. And you know that he always\ndid impress upon your early mind the necessity of stern discipline, and\nobedience to superiors. Your first duty is to your King and country, in\nthe glorious time of war. But with a wretched peace prevailing, your\nduty is to the powers placed by Providence to look after you.""\n\n""I have heard that till I am sick of it,"" he answered rather rudely, for\nI seemed to myself to have put it well: ""is that all you can do for me?\nI had better not have come at all. Look, I have five guineas here, given\nme yesterday, and all good ones. I will put them just in there--and my\nword of honour----""\n\n""My boy, if it were fifty, five hundred, or five thousand, would an\nofficer of the Royal Navy think of listening to them? You have hurt my\nsense of honour.""\n\n""I beg your pardon, Captain Llewellyn,"" he said, hanging down his head:\n""but you used not to be quite so proud. You used to like five shillings\neven.""\n\n""That is neither here nor there,"" I answered very loftily, and\nincreasing his confusion: ""five shillings honourably earned no man need\nbe ashamed of. But what you have offered me is a bribe, for the low\npurpose of cheating your good uncle and dear mother. You ought to sink\ninto the sand, sir.""\n\nHe seemed pretty nearly fit to do so, for I put a stern face on, though\nall the time I could hardly keep from laughing most good-naturedly; when\na little hand went into his, and a little face defied me. Poor sick\nBardie had watched every word, and though unable to understand, she took\nhot sides with the weaker one.\n\n""\'E san\'t sink into \'e sand, I tell \'a, \'e yicked bad old Davy. \'Hot\'s a\ndone to be \'colded so? I\'s very angy with \'a indeed, to go on so to a\ngentleyum.""\n\nBy what instinct could she tell that this was a young gentleman? By the\nsame, I suppose, by which he knew that she was a young lady. And each of\nthem ready to stand up for the other immediately! It made me laugh: and\nyet it is a sad thing to go into.\n\n""Now, my boy,"" I began for fear of losing the upper hand of them; ""you\nare old enough to understand good sense when put before you. It is true\nenough that if you mean to walk the planks like a sailor, you can hardly\nbegin too soon at the time of life you are come to. I was afloat at\nhalf your age, so far as I can remember. But I am bound to lay before\nyou two very serious questions. You will have to meet, and never escape\nfrom, every kind of dirt, and hardship, narrowness, and\nhalf-starving--not an atom of comfort left, such as you are accustomed\nto. Danger I will not speak of, because it would only lead you on to it.\nBut the other thing is this: By going to sea, you will for ever grieve\nand drive out of your prospects not only your good uncle, but perhaps\nalmost your mother.""\n\nI thought I had made a most excellent speech, and Bardie looked up with\nadmiration, to know when I meant to finish. But to my surprise, young\nRodney took very little heed of it.\n\n""That shows how much you know, old Davy! Why I was come on purpose to\ntell you that they are tired out at last: and that I may go to sea, if\nonly you will appoint me a place on board of your ship Alcestis. Now do,\nCaptain Llewellyn, do, and I will never forgot it to you, if ever I\nbecome a great man.""\n\n""My dear boy, I would do it this minute if I had the power. But though\nthey call me \'Captain\' here, I am only Captain of a gun, and Instructor\nof Artillery. And even our Captain himself could not do it. He could\nonly take you as a volunteer, and now there is no call for them. You\nmust get your appointment as midshipman in the regular way from London.\nAnd the chances are fifty to one against your joining the Alcestis. That\nis to say, of course, unless you have some special interest.""\n\nHis countenance fell to the lowest ebb, and great tears stood in his\nbold blue eyes; but presently the hopeful spirit of youth and brave\nlineage returned.\n\n""I will write to my brother in London,"" he said; ""he has never done me a\ngood turn yet; perhaps he will begin this time.""\n\nNot to be too long about it, either by that or some other influence, he\nobtained his heart\'s desire, and was appointed midshipman, with orders\nto join the Alcestis, upon her next appearance off our coast. You should\nhave seen the fuss he made, and his mother too, about his outfit; and\neven Colonel Lougher could not help being much excited. As for me, I was\nforced to go to and fro betwixt Newton and Candleston Court every day,\nand twice a-day, for the purpose of delivering judgment upon every box\nthat came. But when Master Rodney made me toss his spelling-books and\ngrammar at his breast, to practise parrying with his little dirk, I\nbegged him to let me take them home, as soon as he was tired. I have\nthem now with his little stabs in them, and they make me almost\nindependent of the schoolmaster in writing.\n\nNot only was I treated so that I need not have bought any food at\nall--except for Bardie and Bunny--but also employed at a pleasant price\nto deliver lessons every morning as to the names of sails and ropes and\nthe proper style of handling them. We used to walk down to the hard\nsea-shore, with a couple of sharp sticks, whenever the tide allowed fair\ndrawing-room. And the two little children enjoyed it almost as much as\nthe rising hero did. The difficulty was to keep the village children,\nwho paid nothing, from taking the benefit of my lecture as much as\nMidshipman Bluett did. And they might have done so, if they cared to do\nit, for I like a good large audience; but they always went into playing\nhopscotch, in among my ropes and yards, when all done beautifully in\nfine sand, and ready to begin almost--for the proper way is to have a\nship spread naked first, and then hoist sail, if you want to show its\nmeaning. I could not bear to be hard upon these young ones--and some of\nthem good Mother Jones\'s own--all in a mess of activity; and I tried to\nthink that it was all right, because money was earning anyhow. But I\ncould not reconcile it with my sense of duty to make a game of well-paid\nwork; therefore I kept the children out, in a manner I need not now\ndescribe, only you may rely upon it for real ingenuity; for children are\nworse to manage than folk who have been through having them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nA FINE PRICE FOR BARDIE.\n\n\nNow our own two little darlings had behaved so beautifully, gazing at\nthe bad works of the others from a distance only, though sadly pushed to\nshare in them, and keeping their little garters up, when the others were\nhopscotching; also feeling, and pointing out, and almost exaggerating\nthe ruin wrought by the other small ones (which they durst not come down\nto help), that I determined to give them both a magnificent Sunday\ndinner. I would gladly have had the young midshipman down--for on Sunday\nhe was such an ornament, as good as the best church-window!--but now our\ntime was almost up; and though his mother would have let him come to\ngrace my humble cottage, the Colonel insisted that he must go to take\nfarewell of some excellent aunts, from whom he had large expectations,\nand who had ordered him up for the Sunday to the neighbourhood of\nCardiff. However, we could get on very well with our own aristocracy\nonly, which I was sure poor Bardie was, though without any aunts to dine\nher, and it only made me the more determined to have a family party fed\non good fare. We envied nobody as we sate down, and the little ones put\nup both hands, according to some ancient teaching. For the first course,\nwe had conger, baked; a most nourishing, excellent dish, full of jelly\nand things for children. And this one was stuffed, like a loaded cannon,\nwith meat-balls, pork fat, and carraways. Bunny went at him as if she\nhad never secured such a chance in her life before, but Bardie seemed\ninclined to wait for what was coming afterwards, and spent the time in\nwatching Bunny with admiration and contempt mixed, as they are on a\nchild\'s face only.\n\nThen I brought in the dish of the day, with Bunny skipping and going\nabout, and scorching her fingers to help me; but Bardie (having gone\ninto her grandeur) sitting at table steadfastly, and with a resolute\nmind to know what it was before approval. She had the most delicate\nnostrils, but what I brought made her open them. Because I had the very\nbest half of the very best ham ever cured in our parish, through a whole\nseries of good-luck. Luck, and skill, and the will of the Lord, must all\ncombine for a first-rate ham; and here they were met, and no mistake,\nboth by one another and by excellent cooking afterwards. It would not\nbecome me to say any more, when it comes to my mind that the delicate\ngold of infant cabbage, by side of it, was also of my own planting, in a\nbit of black mould in a choice niche, ere Bethel Jose had tempted me. In\nspite of all this wonderful cheer, and the little ones going on\nfamously, the sight of that young cabbage struck a vein of sorrow in me\nsomewhere. To go away, and leave my house and garden for whole years\nperhaps, and feel that it was all behind me, in neglect and loneliness,\nwith no one to undo the windows, or to sow a row of peas, or even dib a\ncabbage in, and perhaps myself to find no chance of coming back to it,\nand none to feel the difference! Like a knife all this went through me;\nso that I must look upward quite, for fear of the little ones watching\nme.\n\nThose two little creatures ate with a power and a heartiness enough to\nmake anybody rejoice in the harmless glory of feeding them. After the\nvery first taste, they never stopped to wipe their lips, or to consider\nanything, but dealt with what they had won, and felt, and thoroughly\nentered into it. Only every now and then they could not help admiring\nwhat I take to be the surest proof of a fine ham and good cookery; that\nis to say, bright stripes of scarlet in between fat of a clear French\nwhite, not unlike our streaky jaspers interlaid with agate. To see that\nlittle thing, who scarce could lift a finger three weeks ago, now\nplaying so brisk a knife and fork, filled me with gratitude and joy, so\nthat I made up my mind to finish my dinner from the conger, and keep the\nrest of the ham for her.\n\nI gave the little souls their wine--as they called it--of\ngooseberry-water, a good egg-cup full apiece; and away they went, like\ntwo little women, into the garden to play with it, and see who would\nkeep it the longest. Then I put the rest of the ham in the cupboard, and\nreturning to the conger, began to enjoy the carver\'s privilege of ten\nminutes for his own fork. But just as I had done handsomely well, and\nwas now preparing to think about a pipe of fine Navy tobacco, and a\nsmall nip of old rum and water, suddenly my door was darkened, and there\nstood the very last man (save one) whom, for my comfort and calm Sabbath\nfeeling, I could ever have wished to see.\n\n""Peace be to this house,"" he began, with his hands spread out, and his\neyes turned up, but his nostrils taking sniff of things: ""peace be to\nthis humble home, and the perishing flesh contained in it! Brother Davy,\nis it well with thee?""\n\n""Brother Hezekiah,"" said I, perceiving what he was up to: ""no flesh does\nthis house contain; for that it is too humble. But in the name of the\nLord, right welcome art thou to cold conger! Brother, I pray thee, arise\nand eat; and go forty days hence on the strength of it.""\n\n""It hath been done,"" replied Hezekiah, ""by Divine grace and unceasing\nprayer. But come, old chap, I am sure you have got something better in\nthat cupboard. Stinking fish hast thou often sold me, and lo I have\nstriven to like it! therefore give me good meat now, and let us rejoice\nat thy great doings.""\n\nThis speech was so full of truth that it got the upper hand of me, both\nby the sense of compunction and the strength of hospitality, and I could\nno longer deny to Perkins all that remained of poor Bardie\'s ham. ""I\nhave expounded the word of the Lord, I have been as Lot in your little\nZoar,"" he cried, going on for the third help of ham; ""my spirit was\nmighty within me, David; and Hepzibah took up the wondrous tale.\nBacksliding brother, where hast thou been? There is a movement and\nrevival set afoot from my burning words and Hepzibah\'s prophecies such\nas shall make your rotten old Church----""\n\n""Have a drop of beer,"" I said, for I did not like to see him shake his\nfist at our church-tower.\n\n""Well, I don\'t mind if I do,"" he answered, ""now I come to think of it.\nEverything in its season, brother. And a drop of your old rum\nafterwards.""\n\nI pretended not to hear this last; for though I might stand him in\ntwopenny ale, I saw no reason for spoiling the tops of a bottle or two\nthat I scorned to open, even when my rheumatics had leapt from my double\nhalf-ribs to my ear-drops. So, after observing that things were locked\nup, I ran into the Jolly, and fetched a pint of small ale, very rapidly.\nNot expecting me back so soon, he had made a good round, with his knife\nin his hand, to see what might be hoped for. Now back he came with a\ngroan, and said that he knew not what he was fit for. When the power of\nthe Word came upon him, he had such spasms afterwards.\n\nI never love to be in company with a man of this sort. When my time is\ncome for thanking God for a fine dinner, I would rather be alongside of\na simple man and a stupid one, who can sit and think with me, and say no\nmore about it. He knew my feelings, I do believe, and enjoyed them like\npickles with his meat; and after finishing every morsel, even down to\nthe mark of the saw upon the very knuck of it, up he put his tallowy\nthumbs with the black nails outwards, and drew a long breath, and\ndelivered, ""In the name of the Lord, Amen. And now, Brother David,\nrejoice a little, as behoves a Christian man, upon the blessed\nSabbath-day.""\n\n""Hezekiah, I have rejoiced to behold your joy in feeding, and to\nminister thereto. Now, having fruition of fleshly things, take the word\nof the Lord, oh my brother, and expound doctrinally; though it be but a\nscore of chapters. I will smoke, and hearken thee.""\n\n""Strong meat is not for babes, my son; and a babe art thou, old Dyo.\nChaps like you must wait and watch for the times of edification. There\nis a time for sowing, and there is a time for reaping. Small ale is not\nmeat for such as bear the burden of the day.""\n\n""\'Kiah, the smith,"" I asked, very shortly, ""what is it you would have of\nme?""\n\n""Brother Davy, I have offered a blessing on thy flesh-pots; and good\nthey were, though not manifold. It is comely that I should offer another\nblessing on thy vessels, Davy.""\n\nWhat could I do with such a man in my own house? Brother Hezekiah\nbecame, at my expense, most hospitable. I found no escape from my own\nbottle, without being rude to my visitor\'s glass; and yet I enjoyed not\na single drop, for want of real companionship. For all my wits were up\nin arms, as if against Parson Chowne almost; because I knew that Master\nPerkins wanted to make a fool of me. So I feigned to be half-seas-over,\nthat he might think he had done it.\n\n""Ancient friend,"" he began at last, when he thought that I was ripe for\nit; ""thou hast lifted me above the height of edification. Peradventure I\nsay words that savour not of wisdom, beloved brother, the fault is\nthine: here I am, and there you are.""\n\n""How can any man having a smithy of his own go on so? An thou wert not\ntipsy, \'Kiah, thou couldst see the contrary. I am here, and thou art\nthere.""\n\n""Just so. You have put it wonderfully,"" he answered, after thinking: ""we\nmay both say right is right, which is the end of everything. Keziah said\nto me, \'Go seek where he is, and how he is; because I have seen noble\nvisions of his exaltation.\' And yet, you see, exalted brother, scarce\nthe tenth part came to her.""\n\n""She knows what she is about,"" said I; ""she dreamed of a red-hot cradle,\nand the hoof of Satan rocking me. Now I see the whole of it. It was\nParson Chowne, and the ferry-boat, and the ketch I was all but burned\nin. Perkins, tell me more, my friend. I have groaned much for neglecting\nthe warning of the prophetess.""\n\n""How many men have groaned in vain for that same cause, old Dyo!\nVainglorious males, they doubt her gift, because she is a female! Out of\nthe mouths of babes and women--brother, I forget the passage, but it\ncomes to that, I think. And now she hath been again in trouble.""\n\n""Concerning what, old Hezekiah? As concerning what, I pray thee?""\n\n""Even touching the child Delushy, in the godless house of Sker. In a\nholy trance it hath been vouchsafed her to behold that poor kid of the\nflock bearing in her mouth a paper, whereupon in letters of blood was\nwritten, \'Come over, and help us.\' And we have found a way to help her,\nwith thy faithful testimony.""\n\nIn his crafty sheep\'s-eyed manner, made of crawling piety mixed with\nsharp and spiteful worldliness, he began to feel my soundings towards a\nscheme so low and infamous, that my blood within me boiled for being\nforced to bear with him. He had prepared the whole plot well, and what\nit came to was just this: Inland there lived a wealthy smelter of the\nMethodist tribe, and Hezekiah was deep in his books for long supply of\nmaterial. Rees ap Rees was his name, and he longed, as every year he\ngrew older, to make up for an ancient wrong, which was coming home to\nhim. In the early days when he was poor, and clever, and ambitious, he\nhad ousted his elder brother from his father\'s hearth, and banished him.\nThis poor fellow fled to the colonies; and for many years no token and\nno news came home of him. Meanwhile Rees ap Rees was growing elderly,\nand worn out with money, which is a frightful thing to feel. But about a\nyear ago, a half-cast sailor had come to his house, bringing a wretched\ndeath-scrawl from this supplanted, but never yet forgotten, and only\nbrother. There were not a dozen lines, but they told a tale that made\nthe rich man weep and eat dry bread for days and days. His brother\nhaving been born without the art of getting on at all, was dying for\nwant of food and comfort, having spent his last penny to keep the mouths\nof his two little babes at work. These poor children had lost their\nmother, and were losing their father now, who with his last breath\nalmost, forgetting wrongs, as we do in death, very humbly committed them\nto the charge of his rich brother. And he said that his only remaining\nfriend, captain of the Nova Scotia, had promised to deliver them safe in\nBristol, to be sent for. The dying father had no strength to speak of\ntheir names, or age, or any other particulars.\n\nNow it so happened that Rees ap Rees was dearly fond of children, as all\nrich childless people are, on account of being denied them: and since\nhis wife died, he had often thought of adopting some one. But being\nrich, he was fidgety now; and none of the children in his neighbourhood\never blew their noses. So here he found, as it were from heaven, two\nlittle dears coming down upon him, his next of kin and right heirs, and\nalso enabling him to go to his parish churchyard, with a sense of duty\ndone, although preferring to rest elsewhere, if by law allowable. You\nmay suppose how he waited and watched; but those two little dears never\ncame. Upon that he longed for them so much more that he offered a reward\nof Â£100 for any tidings of them, and of Â£200 for both or either, brought\nto his house in safety. Hence it will be clear enough what Hezekiah\'s\nscheme was; and half the reward was to be my own.\n\n""All thou hast to say, good Dyo, is what thou saidest at the very time;\nthat the ship was not called Andalusia, but to the best of thy belief\nwas more like Nova Scotia. Also that she was bound for Bristol, and that\nthe other baby\'s clothes bore no coronet, as they fancied, but the\nletter R. done fancifully, as might be by a freemason, such as the poor\nfather was said to be. That garment must be destroyed of course. I have\none prepared for the child Delushy, with \'Martha ap Rees\' in faint\nwriting upon it. This the old man must find out for himself, after our\noverlooking it. He will then believe it tenfold. And after the sight of\nthy uniform, Dyo----ha! how sayest thou, old friend? A snug little sum\nto invest for old age. Thou knowest the old saying, \'Scurvy in the Navy;\nbut the Navy\'s self more scurvy!\' When thou art discharged with three\nhalfpence a-day, one hundred pound with accumulations, say Â£150 then,\nwill help to buy sulphur for thy rheumatics. Myself will give thee ten\nper cent for it, upon sound security.""\n\n""It sounds very well,"" said I, to lead him; ""one hundred and fifty\npounds have a fine sound.""\n\n""Not only that, my noble boy: but the hold thou wilt have on a rich\nyoung maiden, such as Martha ap Rees will be. The old fellow can\'t last\nvery long: none of those smelters ever do, and he hath heart-disease as\nwell. Little Martha will come into Â£20,000 or more, and every penny of\nit hanging upon thee, and me, my lad. Is it well devised, is it grand,\nmy boy; is it worthy of old \'Kiah?""\n\n""That it is,"" I cried; ""most worthy!""\n\nHe flourished his glass in the pride of his heart, and even began to\nsing a song with a chorus of ""Spankadilloes,"" forgetting whose holy day\nit was. Unfortunately I did the same; for my nature can never resist a\nsong: moreover I wanted to think a little. Not from any desire to dwell\nfor a moment on my own interest, but from the great temptation to make\nthe fortunes of our poor castaway. But while I was nursing my left\nknee, with the foot giving time for another chorus (which was just\nbeginning), I heard a tiny pipe, and turned round, and there was the\nlittle thing herself, dancing on one foot, and jerking the other in\nmockery of my attitude, nodding her head to keep time as well, and for\nher very life singing out, ""Pankydillo, dillo, dillo,"" while Bunny\npeeping round the door-post, with a power of Sabbath feeling, looked as\nif the world were ending. It was clear that Bardie had not seen Perkins,\nwhom she never could endure, else would she not have run in from the\ngarden, to bear a share in our melody; and that good brother was so full\nof his noble scheme, and his song, and my rum, that he never noticed her\nbaby voice; and her quick light figure was out of his sight, from the\ncorner of his boozing. Therefore I managed to get her away, and send her\nfor a good walk with Bunny, to look for water-cress at Bruwys Well; for\nI thought it wiser to keep that Perkins ignorant of her whereabouts; and\nBunny could be trusted now to see to any one anywhere.\n\nOff went the heavy one very gravely, and the light one full of antics,\neven in front of the cottages singing ""Pankydillo"" (which hit her\nfancy), so that I feared some disrepute, at such a thing going forth\nfrom our house upon a Sabbath evening. I tried to frown, but she made me\nlaugh by turning round and clapping her knee, exactly as she had seen me\ndo; and it seemed the best thing to go back out of sight, ere neighbours\ngot the key to it. Little she guessed that the fate of her life was\ndancing in the balance, and that her own lightsome play had turned it,\nwhether for good or evil.\n\nHow could I let such a spring of life, such a mischievous innocence, and\nthoroughly earnest devotion to play, sink and be quenched by a formal\nold Methodist in the iron district? Sker House was dull enough for dry\nbones: but there at least she had the sands, and sea, and shells, and\nrabbits, and wild-fowl: nor any one to terrify her with religious\nterrors--which to the young are worst of all--unless it were a ghost or\ntwo of wicked abbots repenting. Whereas I knew what an old compunctious\nMethodist is, who has made some money, and devotes his last years to\n""the service of Jehovah."" Even Â£20,000 could not make it up to her.\n\nTherefore I shook Master Perkins up, for he really had been a little too\nfree, and was going to sleep with his spectacles stuck for a corkscrew\ninto another bottle, and I made him understand that his plan was a great\ndeal too crooked for me, and that the sooner he went to seek Hepzibah\n(who was prophesying on a stool for pickling pork, down at Betsy\nMatthew\'s), and to prepare for his midnight service, with a strong\nRevival rising, the better chance he would have of escaping my now\nrapidly-growing desire to afford him total immersion (which is the only\nsalvation of one highly respectable lot of them) in the well of John the\nBaptist. Hezekiah dreaded water so much that this hint was enough for\nhim; and off he set in a tipsy shamble, to lie down on the sandhills,\nere he came face to face with the prophetess. When I had put things a\nlittle aright, and brushed up the hearth to a bit of fire (to warm the\nmilk for the little ones), and by opening doors and windows sweetened\nall the place with summer flowing in and nestling round the relics of\nthe sunset, and when the neighbours\' chairs (whereon the very old men\nhad been sitting for their Sunday evening) creaked, as if carried in and\ndusted for another Sunday, and there was not one child left (except a\nbad child by the well, whose loose mind was astray with stars, and took\nno heed of supper-time), then the two best children in the village,\nneighbourhood, or county, hand-in-hand came to my door. They were\nwonderfully silent, and they stole (each in her own manner) just a\nlittle glimpse at me, to feel how my temper lay; then they looked at one\nanother, to exchange opinions on that all-important matter. They knew\nthey had been out too late, and had frightened Granny a little perhaps,\nand therefore now had angered him. And in their simple way, they thought\nit wiser not to broach the question. I meant to scold them, but could\nnot find it, when I beheld their pretty ways, within my power to do so.\nAnd lucky for them that I did not know, until next day, when too late to\nscold, what a dreadful mess their clothes were in. In that light I could\nonly see their pretty faces glowing, and their bright eyes full of\ndoubt, and their little bodies shrinking back. Also bundles of\nwater-cress put forward to mitigate righteous wrath. I felt that I had\nbeen having my spree, and these small creatures had only had theirs. So\nI kissed them both, and gave them good supper, and blessed them into\ntheir little bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nPROVIDES FOR EDUCATION.\n\n\nHaving before me several years of absence from home, if it should please\nthe Lord so long to spare me, I now took measures for the welfare of\nthose who would chiefly miss me. The little cottage was my own from many\ngenerations, and in a new will made by a clever man (no less than our\nnew schoolmaster), I left it to Bunny, and all my effects, except my\nboat, and the sum of ten guineas, which two items, as honour demanded,\nwere for Miss Delushy. But what is wealth without education? No more\nthan a plummet without the line. Knowing this, I provided as follows.\n\nA thoroughly fine new schoolmaster had arisen, as aforesaid, for the\npurpose of educating all our Newton children. Our good parson had\nbrought him in, not because the old one, being challenged by the village\ntailor to spell the word ""horse"" without the picture, proved his command\nof the alphabet by accomplishing it in nine different ways, all wrong\n(for that was entered to his credit, when the tailor failed to do the\nlike), but because he horsed a boy and left him there for the afternoon,\nhaving fallen asleep without thrashing him. And it shows what the public\nconfusion of mind is, that there were not three people in all the parish\nwho could help jumbling these stories together, because each of them had\na horse in it! However the poor old man had to go, and Colonel Lougher,\nhaving nothing to do with the spelling of the children, thought it so\nhard on his brother\'s part, that he made the old man his head gardener,\nso as to double his wages, and enable him to sleep not half, but the\nwhole of the afternoon.\n\nHis successor in the school had been sought out very diligently, and he\ncould spell almost as well as Bardie could pronounce a word. But when we\nfound that he came from a distance more than a quick man could walk in a\nday, and that he could not through all his forefathers (although they\nwere quite at his finger-ends) claim so much even as intermarriage with\nany of our third-rate families, much less with any Llewellyns, or\nHopkins, or Bevans, or even Thomases, we saw that even Parson Lougher\nhad gone a little too far for us, and not a woman in the place would let\na bedroom to that man. However we could not bolt him out of his own\nschoolroom, and there he slept, contented with a pile of slates for\nbedstead, and of copy-books for bolster and for pillow. For a week at\nleast he had no school, but he went to church and sang beautifully\n(which brought half the women over), and the children began to be such a\nplague, at home, before Monday morning, that eight or nine were sent\nback to school, as if with halters round their necks. With these he took\nso much kind trouble, that in three hours they learned more than the\nparish had learned for a generation; so much that they could not keep it\ndown when they went home for dinner. In the afternoon there were twenty\npupils, and by the end of the week three dozen. But how could they prove\nhim to their parents qualified for a bedroom?\n\nUpon the strength of my present position, and unrivalled experience, I\nfound it my duty to come to the fore, and take the command of the\nhouseholders. And knowing of course what a waste of time it is to reason\nwith anybody, I seized the bull by the horns, and offered Master Roger\nBerkrolles the occupancy of my cottage upon most liberal conditions.\n""That is to say for rent per quarter, one sea-snail, and per annum one\ncockleshell, to preserve the title; provided nevertheless and upon this\nexpress condition that my lawful granddaughter Bunny should be fed,\nalimented, sufficiently nourished, clothed, clad, apparelled, and in\ngarments found; also taught, instructed, indoctrined, educated and\nperfected in every branch of useful knowledge by the said Roger\nBerkrolles. Item, that if a certain child of tender years known as\n\'Delushy,\' should at any time appear on the premises and demand\ninstruction, instruction of the highest order, and three slices of\nbread-and-butter, should be imparted to her without charge, _de die in\ndiem_."" I objected to these ""dies,"" as being of a nasty churchyard\nsound; but Master Roger convinced me soon, and must have convinced a far\ntougher fellow, that to put our latter end out of sight and out of mind\nso, is a bad example and discouragement for the young ones, whose place\nit is to dwell on it.\n\nA man of far coarser tone of mind than mine would be required to\ndescribe Master Roger\'s sense of gratitude towards me. When I do a\nhandsome thing, I cannot bear to tell of it, nor even to receive the\npraise accruing from what neighbours know. ""Do it, and be done with it,""\nin all such cases is my rule; and if Roger chose to give me an inventory\nof goods and chattels, he can bear me out in saying that I scorned to\ncall a witness in to put his name to it. Business is not my strong\npoint, and it never is with a man of largeness.\n\nThe next thing for me to see to was to get some wicked warrants quashed;\nwhich a deep ignorance of my character, and the lies of very low\nvillains, had induced some weak or vicious magistrates to issue; so that\nin the sporting season (when I might have done my best), I was forced to\ndecamp with my telescope. This has been mentioned perhaps before; but\nnot my strong resolution to face it out, as soon as ever the sense of a\nstrong position enabled me. No doubt they had meant to do their duty;\nand I forgave them altogether. There were three of them. Two names I\nquite forget. How can one think of such trifles at sea? But the third\nwas one Master Anthony Stew, who had tyrannised over me dreadfully, in\nthe times of my tribulation. Up to this man\'s gate I went, and rang the\ngreat bell, with my three stripes on, and a cap of fronted tapestry.\nSquire Anthony was about, somewhere on the premises, would my honour\nmind waiting while the boy went round to look for him? This maid never\nguessed how often she had told me my fish was bad, and what a shame it\nwas to make them eat it up in the kitchen, or starve; and where did I\nhope to go to? Neither did she recollect how she had as good as made me\nkiss her behind the meat-screen, when my glory began to grow for saving\nthose drowned niggers. And yet I could not be sure that she did not know\nit all, and hide it all, for the joy of boasting afterwards. I\nunderstand everything, except women.\n\nWhen I was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs Stew with a curtsy went\nout, as if afraid to trust herself in a presence so imposing, I had a\ngreat mind to take a nip at some of the rubbish upon the table. The\nwhole of these nick-nacks could never have paid me half what this fellow\nhad cost me in fines, expenses, costs, and so on; without a bit of\nevidence from any man of character. However, I only looked at them.\n\nWhen that low Anthony Stew came in, he knew me (before I could speak\nalmost); he gave a quick glance at the table, and then without another\nword showed me out, in spite of all my uniform, to his dirty little\njustice-room. With such a man, I should think it wrong to go into\nhis ribaldry; only he said this, at last; ""Davy, thou thief, we will\nwithdraw them, because we cannot execute them; now thou art in Royal\nService. Five there are, if I remember. Does your conscience plead to\nmore?""\n\n""My conscience pleads to none, your Worship. Perjured scoundrels all of\nthem. Five was the number, I do believe. Alas! what may we come to?""\n\n""The gallows, Dyo, the gallows, thou rogue! Thou hast had some shavings.\nBut when thy turn comes, good Dyo, I will do thee a good turn, if I\ncan.""\n\n""Will your Worship tell me why? I never looked for anything but the\nflint-edge from your Worship.""\n\n""Because thou art the only rogue I never was a match for. There, go thy\nway now; go thy way; or I shall be asking thee to dinner.""\n\n""Nay, your Worship, God forbid! What food have I had since\nbreakfast-time?"" And so I won the last word of him.\n\nAfter this provision for my good repute, and defiance of magisterial\nscandal on behalf of Bunny, my next act was one of pure generosity\ntowards an ancient enemy. Poor Sandy Macraw had a very hard fight to\nmaintain himself and his numerous and still increasing family. Sometimes\nthey did not taste so much as a rind of bacon for months together, but\nlived on barley-bread and dog-fish, or such stuff as he could not sell,\nwith oatmeal cakes for a noble treat every other Sunday. What did I do\nbut impart to him, under document drawn by Berkrolles, that licence to\nfish off and on Sker Point which my courage had well established, with\nauthority to him and covenant by him to attack and scare all poachers;\nthe whole to be void upon my return, if so I should think proper. And\nnot only this, but I put him in funds to replace all his tackle, by\nenabling him to sell his boat. For I went so far as to lease him my own,\nat a moderate yearly rental, upon condition that he should keep her in\nthorough repair and as good as new. And for the further validity (as the\nlease said) of this agreement, two years\' rent became due at once, and\nwas paid from the price of the other boat. My boat went twice as fast as\nSandy\'s, and was far more handy, so that this bargain was fair and\ngenerous, and did honour to all concerned.\n\nThe next and last thing, before starting, was to provide for poor Bardie\nherself. For I feared that Hezekiah, or some other unprincipled fellow,\nmight trump up a case, and get hold of her, and sell, or by other means\nturn into money my little pet, to the loss of my rights, and perhaps her\nown undoing. Resolved as I was to stop all chances of villany of that\nkind, I went direct to Colonel Lougher and to Lady Bluett. Here I made\nthe cleanest breast that ever was scooped out almost. I may declare\nthat I kept in nothing, except about painting the boat, and one or two\ninfinite trifles of that sort, which it would have been a downright\nimpertinence to dwell upon. Nevertheless Colonel Lougher said that some\nblame might attach to me in spite of all pure intentions.\n\nBut Lady Bluett said no, no. She would not hear of it for a moment. The\nonly thing that surprised her was Llewellyn\'s thorough unselfishness,\nand chivalrous devotion to a child who was nothing to him. She was a\nbewitching little dear; no one who saw her could doubt that; still it\nshowed a very soft side to a wonderfully gallant character, when through\nall modesty it appeared what womanly tenderness there had been. And this\nproved how entirely right her opinion had been from the very first, and\nwhat a mistake the good Colonel had made, in declining to let her even\nargue.\n\n""My dear Eleanor, my dear Eleanor,"" cried the Colonel, with his eyes\nwide open, and his white hand spread to her; ""I am surprised to hear you\nsay so. But we cannot go into that question now. Llewellyn begged for my\nopinion. Yours, my dear (as you have proved), is of course more\nvaluable: still I thought that it was mine----""\n\n""To be sure it was, dear Henry. Yours is what was asked for. My rule is\nnever to interrupt you, but to listen silently.""\n\n""To be sure, Eleanor, to be sure! And we always agree in the end, my\ndear. But so far as I can judge at present, Llewellyn, although with the\nvery best meaning----""\n\n""And a display of the greatest valour. Come, Colonel, even by his own\naccount----""\n\n""Yes, my dear, great valour, no doubt, coupled with very sound\ndiscretion. Yet when I come to consider the whole, I really do think\nthat your hero might have entered more fully into these particulars\nabout the boat. Of course, he had no motive, and it was simply an error\nof judgment----""\n\n""Henry, there was no error at all. What could he do when they would not\neven listen to him about the name of the ship? If they would not listen\nabout a ship, is it likely they would listen about a boat? And a very\nsmall atom of a boat! The thing is too ridiculous.""\n\nPerceiving a pause, I made my bow; for the very last thing I could\ndesire would be to sow a controversy between the gentleman and lady,\nwhom of all the county I esteemed the most and loved the best. And I\nknew that if I caused dissension in a pair so well united, each would\nthink the less of me, when they came to make it up together. Moreover,\nmy object was attained. Their attention was drawn to the child again:\nthe Colonel, as the nearest magistrate, was put in legal charge of her:\nI was now quit of all concealment: and Lady Bluett had promised to see\nto the poor thing\'s education, if ever she should need any.\n\nThis I hoped with all my heart that she would do, and quickly too. And\nindeed she was growing at such a pace after that long illness, also\ngetting so wonderfully clever about almost everything, and full of\nremarks that might never strike a grown man till he thought of them,\nthat the only way or chance I saw of taking the genius out of her, was\nto begin her education. Forgetting just now a good deal of my own, and\nbeing so full of artillery, I got Master Berkrolles to make the first\nstart, and show her the way to the alphabet. Our Bunny now could spell\n""cat"" and ""dog,"" and could make a good shot at some other words, and\nenjoyed a laugh at children (head and shoulders over her) whenever they\nwent amiss, and she from the master\'s face was sure of it. But Bardie\nhad never been to school; for I thought it below her rank so much; and\nnow I contrived for our great schoolmaster to come to my cottage, and\nthere begin.\n\nIt must have made the very gravest man, ever cut from a block of wood,\nlaugh to behold Master Roger, and her. He with his natural dignity, and\nwell-founded sense of learning, and continual craving for a perfect form\nof discipline; yet unable to conceal his great wonder at her ways: she\non her side taking measure of him in a shy glance or two, and letting\nher long eyelashes fall, and crossing her feet with one shoulder towards\nhim, for him to begin with her. He vowed that he never had such a pupil;\ninstead of learning, she wanted to know the reason why of everything.\nWhy had A two legs and a girdle, while B had two stomachs and no leg at\nall? C was the moon, from the shape of it. It was no good to tell her\nthat C was the cat; a cat had four legs and C had none: and as for D\nbeing a dog, she would fetch dear Dutch, if he would not believe her,\nand show him what a dog was like. And then perceiving how patient he\nwas, and understanding his goodness, the poor little fatherless soul\njumped up on his knee, and demanded a play with him. He did not know how\nto play very well, because he was an ancient bachelor; but entering into\nher sad luck, from knowledge of her history, he did the very best thing\n(as I thought) that ever had been done to her. He put her on a stool\nbetween his knees, and through the gloss of her hair he poured such very\nbeautiful and true stories, that one could almost see her mind (like the\nbud of a primrose) opening. She pushed up her little hands and tossed\nher thick hair out of the hearing way, and then, being absorbed in some\nadventures like her own almost, round she turned and laid her eyes upon\nhis furrowed yet beaming face, and her delicate elbows on his knees, and\ndrank in every word, with sighs, and short breath, and a tear or two.\n\nAlthough, from one point of view, I did not like to be superseded so,\nespecially in my own department, as might be said, of story-telling, yet\nI put small feelings away, and all the jaundice of jealousy. If I were\nbound to go wherever Government might order me, for the safety of our\nnative land, and with moderate pay accruing, also with a high position,\nand good hopes of raising it, the least I could do was to thank the Lord\nfor sending those two poor children a man, so wise, and accomplished,\nand kind-hearted, bound over to look after them. And yet I would almost\nas lief have committed them into the hands of Mother Jones, who could\nscarcely vie with me. But they promised never to forget me; and the\nnight before I went away, I carried Bardie back to Sker, and saw that\nBlack Evan was dying.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nINTRODUCES A REAL HERO.\n\n\nMy orders were to rejoin at Pembroke on the 10th of June, where the\nAlcestis lay refitting, and taking in stores for an ocean-cruise. Of\ncourse I was punctual to the day, and carried with me a fine recruit,\nMaster Rodney Bluett. I received not only minute directions from his\nlady-mother, but also a tidy little salary, to enable me to look after\nhim. This was a lady of noble spirit, and ready to devote her son for\nthe benefit of his country; because there was no fighting now, nor any\nwar in prospect. Also Colonel Lougher came as far as the gate, where the\ngriffins are, and patted his nephew\'s curly head; and said that although\nit was not quite as he himself could have wished it, he could trust the\nboy to be an honour to a loyal family, and to write home every now and\nthen, for the sake of his poor mother. For his own sake also, I think\nthe Colonel might have very truly said; because while he was talking so,\nand trying to insist on duty, as the one thing needful, I could not for\na moment trust my own eyes to examine him. So we all tried to say\n""good-bye,"" as if there was nothing in it.\n\nIt was a very long ""good-bye,"" even longer than we could by any stretch\nhave dreamed of. Two or three years was the utmost that we then looked\nforward to: but I tell you simple truth, in saying that not one of us\nhad the chance of seeing England, much less any part of Wales, for a\nshorter period than seven years and two months added. You may doubt me,\nand say, ""Pooh, pooh! that was your fault;"" and so on. But you would be\nwholly wrong; and from the Admiralty records our Captain could prove it\nthoroughly. And what is much clearer than all, do you think that Captain\nDrake Bampfylde would have been seven years, or even seven days, away,\nwithout sight of his beautiful lady, Isabel Carey, if it could have been\nmanaged otherwise?\n\nIt was a mixture of bad luck. I can explain a good deal of it, but not\nall the ins and outs. We were ordered here, and ordered there, and then\nsometimes receiving three contradictions of everything. Until we should\nscarcely have been surprised at receiving signal, ""H.M.S. Alcestis to\nthe moon; to wait for orders.""\n\nAnd if we had received that signal, I believe we should have tried it,\nbeing by this time the best-trained and finest ship\'s company in the\nworld. We had ceased to be a receiving-ship, as soon as the war was\nover, and now were what they begin to call--though it sounds against the\ngrain to me--an ""Experimental Ship."" And the Lord knows that we made\nexperiments enough to drown, or blow up, or blow arms off, every man\nborne on our blessed books. They placed me at the head of it all, until\nthe others were up to it; and a more uneasy or ticklish time I never\nhave known, before or since. Over and over again I expected to go up to\nthe sky almost; and you may pretty well conceive how frequent was my\nuneasiness. Nevertheless I still held on; and Government had to pay for\nit.\n\nIn four years\' time the old frigate began to be knocked almost to\npieces; and we made up our minds to be ordered home, and set our\nmemories at work upon all who were likely to meet us, if still in the\nland of the living. While at Halifax thinking thus, and looking forward\nto Christmas-time among our own families, a spick and span new frigate\ncame, of the loveliest lines we had ever seen, and standing-gear the\nmost elegant. She took our eyes so much at once, and she sat the water\nso, that there was not a man of us able to think of anything else till\nall hands piped down. This was the Thetis, if you please, taken from the\nCrappos in the very last action of the war, a 46-gun frigate, but larger\nthan an English 60-gun ship. The French shipbuilders are better than\nours, but their riggers not to be compared; which is the reason perhaps\nwhy they always shoot at our rigging instead of our hulls. At any rate,\nhaving been well overhauled, and thoroughly refitted at Chatham, and\nrigged anew from step to truck, she presented an appearance of most\ntempting character.\n\nIt was a trick of the Naval Board to keep us together, and it succeeded.\nThose gentlemen knew what we were by this time, the very best ship\'s\ncompany to be found in all the service; and as there were signs already\nof some mischief brewing, their desire was still to keep together such a\npiece of discipline. My humble name had been brought forward many times\nwith approval, but without any effect so far upon wages or position.\nNow, however, my Lords had found it expedient to remember me, and David\nLlewellyn was appointed master\'s mate to the Thetis, if he should think\nfit to join her; for the whole after our long service was a matter of\nvolunteering.\n\nThere was not a man of us dared to leave Captain Drake Bampfylde\nshabbily. We turned over to the Thetis, in a body, with him; and the\ncrew that had manned her from England took the old Alcestis home again.\nAnd junior Lieutenant Bluett, now a fine young fellow, walked the\nquarter-deck of the Thetis, so that you should have seen him. But first\nand foremost was to see our great Captain Drake; as ready as if he were\nalways looking out for an enemy\'s ship from the foretop. He walked a\nlittle lame, on account of the piece the shark took out of him;\nnevertheless we had not a man to equal him for activity. I remember once\nwhen a violent gale caught us on the banks of Newfoundland, and the sky\ncame down upon us black as any thunder-cloud. The wind grew on us so\ntowards nightfall, that after taking in reef after reef, the orders were\nto make all snug, send down the topgallant-masts, and lie-to under\nclose-reefed main-topsail and fore-topmast staysail. Captain Drake was\nhimself on deck, as he always was in time of danger, and through the\nroar of the gale his orders came as clear as a bell almost, from the\nmouth of his speaking-trumpet. ""Main-top men, to station! Close reef the\nmain-topsail. Mr Bluett, clew up, clew up. There is not a moment to\nlose, my men. Spit to your hands and stick like pitch. What! are you\nafraid then, all of you?""\n\nFor the sail was lashing about like thunder, having broken from the\nquarter-gasket, and when the men came to the topsail-yard they durst not\ngo upon it. Then a black squall struck them with blinding rain, and they\nscarce could see one another\'s faces, till a cheery voice came from the\nend of the yard, ""Hold on, my lads--hold on there! You seem so skeery of\nthis job, I will do it for you."" ""\'Tis the devil himself!"" cried old Ben\nBower, captain of the main-top; ""let him fly, let him fly, my lads!"" ""It\nis our Captain,"" said I, who was coming slowly up to see to it, myself\nprepared to do the job, and shame all those young fellows; ""skulk below,\nyou jelly-pots, and leave it to me and the Captain."" ""A cheer for the\nCaptain, a cheer for the Captain!"" they cried before I could follow\nthem, and a score of men stood against the sky, in the black pitch of\nthe hurricane, as if it were a review almost. For they guessed what the\nCaptain must have done, and it made a hero of each of them. While they\ncame slowly up the ratlins, he clomb the rigging like a cat, and before\nthey got to the lubber\'s hole he was at the topmasthead, whence he slid\ndown by the topping-lift to the very end of the mainyard. Such a thing\ndone in a furious gale, and the sea going mountains high almost, beat\neven my experience of what British captains are up to. After that, if he\nhad cried, ""Make sail to""--Heligoland, with no landing to it--there was\nnot a man of us but would have touched his hat, and said, ""Ay, ay, sir!""\n\nAnd now we first met Captain Nelson in command of the Boreas, a poor\nlittle frigate; we could have sunk her as easily as we outsailed her.\nBut as senior to Captain Drake, he at once assumed command of us;\nalthough it was not in our instructions to be at his disposal. The\nAmericans then were carrying on with the privileges of British subjects,\nin trading with the Leeward Islands; although they had cast off our\nauthority in a most uncourteous, and I might say headstrong manner.\nCaptain Nelson could never put up with the presumptuous manners of this\nrace, and he felt bitterly how feeble had been our behaviour to them.\nThese are people who will always lead the whole world, if they can;\ncounting it honour to depart from and get over old ideas. And now they\nwere doing a snug bit of roguery with the Leeward Islands, pretending\nto have British bottoms, while at bottom Yankees.\n\nNelson set his face against it; and whenever he set his face, his hand\ncame quickly afterwards. We soon cut up that bit of smuggling, although\nthe Governor of the Islands was himself against us. Captain Nelson\'s\norders were to enforce the Navigation Act; and we did it thoroughly.\n\nEver so many times I met him, as he now came to and fro; and he took the\nbarge-tiller out of my hand, at least a dozen times, I think. For he\nnever could bear that another man should seem to do his work for him,\nany more than he could bear to see a thing done badly. Not that he found\nfault with my steering (which was better than his own, no doubt), but\nthat he wanted to steer himself. And he never could sit a boat quietly,\nfrom his perpetual ups and downs, and longing to do something. He knew\nmy name; he knew every one\'s name; he called me ""old Dyo,"" continually,\nbecause the men had caught it up; and in my position, I could not\nperceive what right he had to do so. I had him on my lap, I won\'t say\nfifty times, but at least fifteen: for he never had sea-legs at all when\na heavy sea was running: and I never thought it any honour, but\ncherished some hopes of a shilling, or so. As for appearance, at first\nsight he struck me as rather grotesque-looking than imposing, in spite\nof his full-laced uniform, and the broad flaps of his waistcoat. His\nhair, moreover, was drawn away from his forehead, and tied in a lanky\ntail, leaving exposed, in all its force, rather a sad face, pale and\nthin, and with the nose somewhat lop-sided. Also the shoulders badly\nshaped, and the body set up anyhow; and the whole arrangement of his\nframe nervous, more than muscular.\n\nIn spite of all this, any man who knows the faces of men, and their true\nmeaning, could not fail to perceive at once that here was no common\nmortal. The vigour and spirit of his eyes were such that they not only\nseemed to be looking through whatever lay before them, but to have\ndistinct perception of a larger distance, and eagerness to deal with it.\nAnd the whole expression of his face told of powerful impatience, and a\nlonging for great deeds, dashed with melancholy. The entire crew of his\nship, I was told, were altogether wrapped up in him, and would give\ntheir lives for him without thought; and there was not one of them but\nwas mad with our Government for being at peace, and barring Captain\nNelson from the exploits he was pining for. One of them struck at me\nwith an oar, when I said how puny Nelson was, compared with our Drake\nBampfylde, and only the strong sense of my position enabled me to put up\nwith it. And what I said was all the time the very truest of the true;\nand that was why it hurt them so. We being now the finest and smartest\nfrigate in the service, looked down upon that tub of a Boreas, and her\nwaddle-footed crew, and her pale, pig-tailed commander, with a power of\nignominy which they were not pleased with. And all the time we were at\ntheir orders, and they took care to let us know it! We would have fought\nthem with pleasure, if the rules of the service allowed it.\n\nEnough of that uncomfortable discontent and soreness. The hardest point\nis for a very great man to begin to set forth his greatness. We could\nnot, at the moment, see why Horatio Nelson should thus sweep off with\nthe lead so. But after he had once established what he was, and what he\nmeant, there was no more jealousy. To this I shall come in its proper\nplace; I am only now picking up crumbs, as it were, and chewing small\njobs honourably.\n\nBut against one thing I must guard. Our Captain Drake was never for a\nmoment jealous of Captain Nelson. It was one of the things that annoyed\nus most, when we looked down on the Boreas, and would gladly have had a\ngood turn with those fellows who assumed such airs to us, to find that\nour beloved Captain was as full of Nelson as the worst of the Boreasses.\nAnd one of our men who went on strongly, took six dozen, and no mistake,\nand acknowledged how well he deserved it. That is the way to do things,\nand makes all of us one family.\n\nIt is time for me now to crowd all sail for Spithead, as we did at last.\nSeven round years and two months were gone since I had seen old Cymru,\nand I could fill seven thousand pages with our whole adventures. But\nnone of them bore much on my tale, and nobody cares for my adventures,\nsince I ceased to be young and handsome; and sometimes I almost thought\n(in spite of all experience) that I had better have gone into matrimony\nwith a young woman of moderate substance. But (as is the case with those\nthings) when I had the chance I scorned it; not being touched in the\nheart by any one, and so proud of freedom. Moreover, the competition for\na man amongst young women may become so lively as to make him bear away\nlarge down wind. Exactly what had happened to me in the land of\nDevonshire.\n\nThree quarters of my pay had been assigned to Roger Berkrolles, under\nmy hand and signature, for the maintenance of our Bunny (so far as the\nrent might not provide it), and for the general management of things,\nand then to accumulate. So that, after all, I had not any amazing sum to\ndraw, remembering, too, that from time to time we had our little tastes\nof it. Nevertheless, when added up, I really was surprised to find that\nthe good clerks thought it worth so much quill-chop over it. And now I\nhad been for several years on the pay of a petty officer (master\'s\nmate), and looking forward to be master, if he were good enough to drop\noff.\n\nHe was truly tough, and would never drop off; and I felt it the more\nbecause he was ten years my junior, and unseasoned. He drew half again\nas much as I did, though he knew that I had done all the work. He gave\nme two fingers to say good-bye, which is a loathsome trick to me; so I\nput out my thumb, which was difficult to him: and the next time I saw\nhim, he lay dead in the cockpit of the Goliath.\n\nIn a word, I got so little after all my long endeavours to secure the\nBritish nation from its many enemies, that verily I must have fallen to\nthe old resource again, and been compelled to ask for alms to help me\nhome in 1790, as had happened to me in the year of grace 1759. We\nsailors always seem to be going either up or down so much, without\nseeming to know why. Perhaps it is a custom from our being on the waves\nso much. However, I was saved from doing such disgrace to the uniform\nand to my veteran aspect, and the hair by this time as white as snow,\nsimply through the liberality of our Captain Bampfylde. For he made me\nan offer both kind and handsome, though not more perhaps than might be\nexpected, after our sailing together so long. This was to take me home\nwith him to Narnton Court, or the neighbourhood, according to how the\nland might lie, and thence to secure me a passage (which is easy enough\nin the summer-time) by one of the stone-boats to Newton Nottage. I felt\nthat I might have come home in grander style than this was like to be;\nand yet it was better than begging my way; and scarcely any man should\nhope to be landed twice in all his life, at his native village from a\nman-of-war. Of course, if Master Rodney Bluett had still been with us,\nhe would have seen to my return, and been proud of it; but he had been\nforced to leave us, having received his appointment as 3d lieutenant to\nthe Boadicea, 74.\n\nTherefore I travelled with Captain Drake, and made myself useful upon\nthe road, finding his coxswain (who came with us in a miserably menial\nmanner) utterly useless, whenever a knowledge of life and the world was\ndemanded. And over and over again, my assistance paid my fare, I am sure\nof it, whether it were by coach or post. Because the great mass of\nseaman appear, whenever they come on shore, to enjoy a good cheating\nmore than anything. The reason is clear enough--to wit, that having seen\nno rogues so long, they are happy to pay for that pleasure now.\n\nIt was said that even the Admiralty had been playing the rogue with us,\nstopping our letters, and our news, to keep us altogether free from any\ndisturbances of home. At any rate, very few of us had heard a word of\nEngland, except from such old papers as we picked up in the colonies.\nAnd now, after seven years, how could we tell what to expect, or how\nmuch to fear?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nAFTER SEVEN YEARS.\n\n\nFrom Exeter to Barnstaple, we crowded sail with horses\' tails, and a\nheavy sea of mud leaping and breaking under the forefoot of our coach.\nAlso two boys on the horses, dressed like any admirals, one with horn on\nhis starboard thigh, and the other with jack-boots only. It was my\nprivilege to sit up in the foretop, as might be, with Coxswain Toms in\nthe mizentop, and the Captain down in the waist by himself. We made\nabout six knots an hour perhaps; whenever we got jerks enough to keep up\nthe swearing.\n\nBut the impatience of our Captain showed how very young he was, now at\nforty years of age, according to chronology, though nobody would believe\nit! Surely he might have waited well, after so long waiting; and if he\ncould not chew a quid--which breeds a whole brood of patience--at any\nrate he had fine pipes, and with common-sense might have kindled them. I\nhanded him down my flint and steel, and my hat to make a job of it; but\nhe shut up the glass, and cried, ""More sail!"" in a voice that almost\nfrightened me.\n\nIt was as dark as main-top-tree holes by the time we got to Barnstaple;\nbut we found no less than four fine lamps of sperm-oil burning, and\ntallow-candles here and there, in shops of spirit and enterprise. The\nhorses were stalled, and the baggage housed in a very fine inn, looking\nup the street, and then the Captain told Toms and me to house up our\njibs, while he went out. This we were only too glad to do after so much\nheavy rolling upon _terra firma_, as those landsmen love to call it, in\nspite of all earthquakes, such as killed thirty thousand Italian people,\nwhen first I took to the sea again.\n\nBut before long, Toms and I began to feel that we had no right to\nabandon our commander so. Here we were in a town that hardly ever saw a\nroyal sailor, and could not be supposed to know for a moment what his\nduties were, or even to take a proper pride in seeing him borne\nharmless. And here was our Captain gone out in the dark, with his\ncocked-hat on, and his gold lace shining wherever a tallow-candle hung;\nalso with a pleasant walk as if he were full of prize-money; though the\nEvil One had so patched up a peace that we never clinked a halfpenny.\n\nWhen old Jerry Toms and my humble self had scarcely gone through three\nglasses, he said to me, and I said to him, that we were carrying on too\ncoolly in a hostile town like this. And just at this moment the Navy was\ndown in popular estimation; for such is the public urgency, whenever we\nare paid for, without being killed or wounded. Therefore Jerry and I\nwere bound to steer with a small helm, and double the watch.\n\nWe beat up the enemy\'s quarters calmly, finding none to challenge us;\nand then we got tidings of our Captain out upon the Braunton road. Jerry\nwas a man of valour, and I could not hang back to be far behind him; and\nwe had been concerned in storming many savage villages. So we stormed\nthis little town, carrying our hangers, and nobody denied us. But before\nwe were half a mile entirely out of hearing, the mayor arose from his\nsupper, and turned out the watch, and beat the drums, and bred such\nalarm that in one street there were three more people alive ere morning.\n\nMeanwhile Jerry Toms and I shaped our course for the Braunton road, and\nhit it, and held on to it. And, because no man, in strange places, knows\nwhat the air may contain for him, Jerry sang a song, and I struck\nchorus; with such an effect that the cows were frightened all along the\nhedgerows. This put us quite on our legs again; and a more deeply sober\ncouple could not, or at any rate need not, be seen, than that which\nmyself and Jerry were, after two miles of walking.\n\nIn this manner, steering free, yet full of responsibility, we doubled\nthe last point of the road, where it fetches round to Narnton Court. And\nhere we lay to, and held council, out of the tide of the road, and in\nwhat seemed to be a lime-kiln.\n\nThe coxswain wanted to board the house, and demand our Captain out of\nit; we had carried all public opinion thus, and the right thing was to\ngo on with it. But I told him very strongly (so that he put down his\ncollar from his ears to listen) that no doubt he was right enough upon a\nhundred thousand subjects, yet was gone astray in this. And if we\nboarded a house at night, after carrying all the town by storm, what\nship had we to bear us away from the mayor and his constables to-morrow?\n\nIn this dilemma, who should appear but the Captain himself, with his\nhead bowed down, and his walk (which was usually so brisk in spite of a\ntrifling lameness), his very walk expressing that his heart was full of\nsadness.\n\n""How much longer? How much longer?"" he was saying to himself, being so\ntroubled that he did not see us in the shadow there. ""My own brother to\nhave sworn it! Will the Lord never hold His hand from scourging and from\ncrushing me? Would that I were shot and shrouded! It is more than I can\nbear.""\n\nIn this gloomy vein he passed us; and we looked at one another, daring\nnot to say a word. How could a pair of petty officers think of intruding\nupon the troubles and private affairs of a post-captain, even though,\nsince our ship was paid off, we could hardly be said to serve under him?\n""Blow me out of the mouth of a gun,"" cried Coxswain Toms, in a shaking\nvoice, ""if ever I was so amazed before! I would have sworn that our\nSkipper was not only the handsomest but the happiest man in all the\nservice.""\n\n""Then, Jerry, I could have set you to rights. How many times have I\nhinted that our Skipper had something on his mind, and none of you would\nhearken me?""\n\n""True for you, my lad. I remember, now you come to speak of it. But we\npaid no heed; because you looked so devilish knowing, and would go no\nfurther. Old Dyo, I beg your pardon now; there is good stuff in you,\nfriend Dyo--thoroughly good stuff in you.""\n\n""I should rather think there was,"" I replied, perhaps a little drily,\nfor he ought to have known it long ago: ""Jerry, I could tell you things\nthat would burst the tar of your pig-tail. Nevertheless I will abstain,\nbeing undervalued so. Ho, shipmate! Haul your wind, and hail! I am\nblessed if it isn\'t old Heaviside!""\n\nEven in the dark, I knew by the walk that it was a seaman, and now my\neyes were so accustomed to look out in all sorts of weather, that day or\nnight made little difference to my sense of vision, which (as you may\nsee hereafter) saved a British fleet, unless I do forget to tell of it.\n\n""Heaviside is my name, sir. And I should like to know what yours may\nbe.""\n\n""David Llewellyn."" And so we met; and I squeezed his hand till he longed\nto dance; and I was ready to cut a caper from my depth of feeling.\n\nI introduced him to Jerry Toms, according to strict formality; and both\nbeing versed in the rules of the service, neither would take precedence;\nbut each of them hung back for the other fellow to pretend to it, if he\ndared. I saw exactly how they stood; and being now, as master\'s mate,\nsuperior officer to both, I put them at their ease, by showing that we\nmust not be too grand. Thus being all in a happy mood, and desirous to\nmake the best of things, we could not help letting our Captain go to\ndwell upon his own fortunes. Not that we failed of desire to help him,\nbut that our own business pressed.\n\nGunner Heaviside led us down to a little cabin set up by himself on the\nvery brink of Tawe high-water mark, as a place of retirement when hard\npressed, and unable to hold his own in the bosom of his family. You may\nwell be surprised--for I was more, I was downright astonished--to find\nthat this was my old ferry-boat, set up (like a dog begging) on shores,\nwith the poop channelled into the sand, and the sides eked out with\ntarpaulin. A snugger berth I never saw for a quiet man to live in: and\nthough Heaviside scorned to tell us, and we disdained to ask him,\nthat--as I guessed from the first--was the true meaning of it. This poor\nfellow had been seduced--and I felt for his temptations--(when he came\nfresh from salt water, and our rolling ideas of women) into rapid\nmatrimony with that sharp Nanette. He ought to have known much better;\nand I ought to have given him warning; but when he had made up his mind\nto settle, I thought it was something solid. I gave him the names, as I\nmay have said, of good substantial farmers\' daughters, owning at least a\ngood cow apiece from the date of their majority, also having sheets and\nblankets, and (as they told me many a time) picked goosefeathers enough\nfor two. And yet he must go and throw himself away upon that Nanette so!\n\nBut when I came to hear his case, and he for a moment would not admit\nthat it was worse than usual, or that he wanted pity more than any other\nmen do, and scarcely knew how far he ought, or dared even, to accept it;\nand then at the gurgling of his pipe, fancied that he heard somebody;\nJerry and I squeezed hands for a moment, and were very careful not to\ntantalise this poor man, with our strong-set resolution. ""Give a wide\nberth to all womankind,"" was what we would have said, if we could when\nnow it was too late for him; ""failing that, stand off and on, and let\nthe inhabitants come down, and push off their boats, and victual you.""\n\nPoor Heaviside fetched a sigh enough to upset all arrangements; for\nJerry and I (good widowers both) were not likely to be damped, at the\nproper time for jollifying, by the troubles of a man who was meant to\nafford us rather a subject for rejoicing. Therefore we roused him up,\nand said, or at least conveyed to him, that he must not be so sadly down\nupon his luck like this. And hearing that he had six children now, and\nwas in fear of a seventh one, I was enabled to recollect more than\ntwenty instances of excellent women who had managed six, and gone off at\nthe seventh visitation.\n\nThis good news put such sudden spirit into my old shipmate, that he\nceased for a long time to be afeared of all that his wife could do to\nhim. He never said a word to show what his mind suggested to him,\nwhether good or evil. Only he made me tell those cases of unmerited\nmercy (as he put it) such a number of times that I saw what comfort he\nwas deriving. And then we challenged him to tell us what was going on\nwith him.\n\nHe seemed rather shy of discussing himself, but said that he was in Sir\nPhilip\'s service, as boatman, long-shoreman, and river-bailiff, also\npork-salter (as a son of the brine), and watercress-picker to the\nfamily. In a word, he had no work whatever to do; as you may pretty\nsafely conclude, when a man is compelled to go into a catalogue of his\nactivities. This sense of ease overweighed him no doubt, and made the\ntime hang heavily, after so much active service, so that Naval\nInstructor Heaviside moved about, and began to gossip, and having no\nbusiness of his own, spent his mind upon other folks\'. Now, as we began\nto see through him, and the monotony of a fellow who is under his wife\'s\nthumb (without the frankness to acknowledge, and enlist our sympathies\nfor this universal burden), both Jerry and I desired to hear something a\nlittle more new than this. All things are good in their way, and devised\nby a finely careful Providence; so that no man, whose wife is a plague\nto him, can fail of one blessed reflection--to wit, that things are\nordered so for the benefit of his fellow-creatures.\n\nThus our noble Heaviside, not being satisfied with the state of things\nat home--especially after he had appealed to Nanette\'s strong sense of\nreason (which bore sway in the very first week of half the honeymoon\ngloriously), and after he had yielded slowly all his outworks of\ntobacco, coming down from plugs to pipes, and from pipes to paper\nthings, without stink enough to pay for rolling, and so on in the\ndownward course, till he would have been glad of dry sugar-canes, or the\nstems of ""old-man\'s beard,""--this poor but very worthy fellow gallantly\nsurrendered, and resolved to rejoice, for the rest of his time, in his\nneighbours\' business mainly.\n\nHerein he found great and constant change from his own sharp troubles.\nEverybody was glad to see him; and the wives who were the very hardest\nupon their own husbands, thought that he showed himself much too soft in\nthe matter of Madame Heaviside. It was not his place, when that subject\narose, to say either ""yes"" or ""no;"" but to put aside the question, as\none that cannot be debated, out of the house, with dignity. Only every\none liked him the more, the moment they remembered how contagious his\ncomplaint was.\n\nRegard this question as you will (according to lack of experience), it\nwas much for our benefit that the Naval Instructor was henpecked. He had\naccumulated things, such as no man can put together, whose wife allows\nhim to have his talk. If he may lay down the law, or even suggest for\nconsideration, he lets out half his knowledge, and forgets the other\nhalf of it. Whereas, if all his utterance is cut short at beginning, he\nhas a good chance to get something well condensed inside him. Thus, if\nyou find any very close-texture and terseness in my writings, the credit\nis due to my dear, good wife, who never let me finish a sentence. I\ndaresay she had trouble with me; and I must be fair to her. It takes a\nvery different man to understand a different woman; and these things\nwill often touch us too late, and too sadly. I gave her a beautiful\nfuneral, to my utmost farthing; and took her headstone upon credit,\nalmost before the sexton would warrant that the earth was settled.\n\nThat night my old friend Heaviside (who has led me, from like\nexperience, into a wholly different thing) showed some little of himself\nagain, before our whale-oil light began to splutter and bubble too\nviolently. Our society quite renewed his hope of getting away again;\nespecially when I explained to him that (according to my long\nacquaintance with law), no one could hold him accountable for any\nquantity of children which a Frenchwoman might happen to have. An alien,\nto wit, and a foreigner, worst of all a Frenchwoman, could not expect\nall her froggy confinements to hold good in England. He had committed a\nfoolish and unloyal act in buckling to with an alien enemy, and he\ndeserved to pay out for it; but I thought (and Coxswain Toms was of the\nsame opinion) that poor Heaviside now had suffered ever so much more\nthan even a Frenchwoman could expect of him. And we begged him to go\nafloat again.\n\nHe shook his head, and said that he had not invited our opinions, but to\na certain extent endeavoured to be thankful for them. Yet he suggested\ndelicately that after being so long at sea, we might have waited for our\nland-legs, before we became so positive. And if we would not mind\nallowing him to see to his own concerns, he would gladly tell all he\nknew about those of other people. This appeared to me to be a perfectly\nfair offer; but Jerry Toms took a little offence, on account of not\nknowing the neighbourhood. As superior officer of the three, I insisted\nupon silence, especially as from old times I knew what villany might be\naround us. And as soon as Heaviside could descry quite clearly what tack\nI stood upon, he distinctly gave his pledge to be open as the day.\nTherefore we all filled our pipes again, and took fresh lights for them,\nand looked at one another, while this old chap told his story. And\nplease to mind that he had picked up a prawn-netful of little trifles,\nsuch as I never could stoop to scoop, because he won such chances\nthrough the way the women pitied him. Only I must in ship-shape put his\nrambling mode of huddling things. If you please, we are now going back\nseven years, and more than that, to the very date of my escape from\nDevonshire; so as to tell you what none of us knew, until we met with\nHeaviside.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nMISCHIEF IN A HOUSEHOLD.\n\n\nIt seems that no sooner did Parson Chowne discover how cleverly I had\nescaped him (after leaving my mark behind, in a way rather hard to put\nup with), than he began to cast about to win the last stroke somehow.\nAnd this, not over me alone, but over a very much greater man, who had\ncarried me off so shamefully--that is to say, Captain Bampfylde.\nHeaviside was not there as yet, but with us in the Alcestis, so that he\ncould not describe exactly the manner of Chowne\'s appearance. Only he\nheard from the people there, that never had such terror seized the house\nwithin human memory. Not that Chowne attempted any violence with any\none; but that all observed his silence, and were afraid to ask him.\n\nWhat was done that night between Sir Philip and the Parson, or even\nbetween the Parson and Sir Philip\'s heir, the Squire (whose melancholy\nroom that Chowne had dared to force himself into), nobody seemed to be\nsure, although every one craved to have better knowledge. But it was\ncertain that Isabel Carey went to her room very early that night, and\nwould have no Nanette for her hair; and in the morning was ""not fit for\nany one to look at,"" unless it were one who loved her.\n\nGreat disturbances of this sort happen (by some law of nature), often in\nlarge households. Give me the quiet cottage, where a little row, just\nnow and then, comes to pass, and is fought out, and lapses (when its\nheat is over) into very nice explanations, and women\'s heads laid on\nmen\'s shoulders, and tears that lose their way in smiles, and reproach\nthat melts into self-reproach. However, this was not the sort of thing\nthat any sane person could hope for in thirty miles\' distance from\nMaster Stoyle Chowne, after once displeasing him. And what do you think\nParson Chowne did now, or at least I mean soon afterwards? That night he\nhad pressed his attentions on the beautiful young lady, so that in\nsimple self-defence she was forced to show her spirit. This aroused the\npower of darkness always lurking in him, so that his eyes shone, and his\njaws met, and his forehead was very smooth. For he had a noble forehead;\nand the worse his state of mind might be, the calmer was his upper brow.\nAfter frightening poor Miss Carey, not with words, but want of them\n(which is a far more alarming thing, when a man encounters women), he\ntook out his rights in the house by having an interview with Sir Philip;\nand no one could make any guess about what passed between them. Only it\ncould not be kept from knowledge of the household, that Parson Chowne\nobtained or took admission to Squire Philip also.\n\nOf this unhappy gentleman very little has been said, because I then knew\nso little. I am always the last man in the world to force myself into\nprivate things; and finding out once that I must not ask, never to ask\nis my rule of action, unless I know the people. However, it does not\nlook as if Master Heaviside had been gifted with any of this rare\ndelicacy. And thus he discovered as follows.\n\nSquire Philip\'s brain was not so strong as Captain Bampfylde\'s. He had\nbeen very good at figures, while things went on quietly; also able to\nride round and see the tenants, and deal with them, as the heir to a\nlarge estate should do. The people thought him very good: and that was\nabout the whole of it. He never hunted, he never shot, he did not even\ncare for fishing. A man may do without these things, if he gets repute\nin other ways (especially in witchcraft), but if he cannot show good\ncause for sticking thus inside four walls, an English neighbourhood is\napt to set him down for a milksop. And tenfold thus, if he has the means\nto ride the best horse, and to own the best dogs, and to wear the best\nbreeches that are to be bought.\n\nSquire Philip must not be regarded, however, with prejudice. He had good\nlegs, and a very good seat, and his tailor said the same of him. Also,\nhe took no objection to the scattering of a fox, with nothing left for\nhis brush to sweep up, and his smell made into incense; nor was the\nSquire, from any point of view, or of feeling, squeamish. Nevertheless\nhe did not give satisfaction as he should have done. He meant well, but\nhe did not outspeak it; only because to his quiet nature that appeared\nso needless. And the rough, rude world undervalued him, because he did\nnot overvalue himself. This was the man who had withdrawn, after deep\naffliction, into a life, or a death, of his own, abandoning hope too\nrapidly. He had been blessed, or cursed, by nature, with a large, soft\nheart; and not the flint in his brains there should be for a wholesome\nbalance. I know the men. They are not very common; and I should like to\nsee more of them.\n\nThis Squire Philip\'s hair was whiter than his father\'s now, they said;\nand his way of sitting, and of walking, growing older. No wonder, when\nhe never took a walk, or even showed himself; rather like a woman\nyielding, who has lost her only child. It is not my place to defend him.\nAll our ways are not alike. To my experience he seemed bound to grieve\nmost about his children. For a man may always renew his wife more easily\nthan his children. But Squire Philip\'s view of the matter took a\ndifferent starting-point. It was the loss of his wife that thus unwisely\novercame him.\n\nAccordingly he had given orders for women alone to come near him,\nbecause they reminded him of his wife, and went all around in a\nflat-footed way, and gave him to see that they never would ask, yet\ngladly would know, his sentiments. And living thus, he must have grown a\nlittle weak of mind, as all men do, with too much of a female circle\nround them.\n\nWhat Parson Chowne said to this poor gentleman, on the night we are\nspeaking of, was known to none except themselves and two or three maids\nwho listened at the door, because their duty compelled them thus to\nprotect their master. And all of these told different stories, agreeing\nonly upon one point; but the best of them told it, as follows. Chowne\nexpressed his surprise and concern at the change in his ancient friend\'s\nappearance, and said that it was enough to make him do what he often had\nthreatened to do. Squire Philip then asked what he meant by this; and he\nanswered in a deep, low voice, ""Bring to justice the villain who, for\nthe sake of his own advantage, has left my poor Philip childless: and\nwith all the fair Isabel\'s property too! Greedy, greedy scoundrel!"" They\ncould not see the poor Squire\'s face, when these words came home to him;\nbut they knew that he fell into a chair, and his voice so trembled that\nhe could not shape his answer properly.\n\n""Then you too think, as I have feared, as I have prayed, as I would die,\nrather than be forced to think. My only brother! And I have been so kind\nto him for years and years. That he was strong and rough, I know--but\nsuch a thing, such a thing as this----""\n\n""He began to indulge his propensities for slaughter rather early--I\nthink I have heard people say.""\n\n""Yes, yes, that boy at school. But this is a wholly different\nthing--what had my poor wife done to him?""\n\n""Did you ever hear that Drake Bampfylde offered himself to the Princess,\nwhile you were away from home, and a little before you did?""\n\n""I never heard anything of the kind. And I think that she would have\ntold me.""\n\n""I rather think not. It would be a very delicate point for a lady.\nHowever, it may not be true.""\n\n""Chowne, it is true, from the way you say it. You know it to be true;\nand you never told me, because it prevents any further doubt. Now I see\neverything, everything now. Chowne, you are one of the best of men.""\n\n""I know that I am,"" said the Parson, calmly; ""although it does not\nappear to be the public opinion. However, that will come right in the\nend. Now, my poor fellow, your wisest plan will be to leave yourself\naltogether to a thoroughly trustworthy man. Do you know where to find\nhim?""\n\n""Only in you, in you, my friend. My father will never come to see me,\nbecause--you know what I mean--because--I dared to think what is now\nproved true.""\n\n""Now, Philip, my old friend, you know what I am. A man who detests every\nkind of pretence. Even a little inclined perhaps to go too far the other\nway.""\n\n""Yes, yes; I have always known it. You differ from other men; and the\ngreat fault of your nature is bluntness.""\n\n""Philip, you have hit the mark. I could not have put it so well myself.\nMy fine fellow, never smother yourself while you have such abilities.""\n\n""Alas! I have no abilities, Chowne. The whole of them went, when my\ngood-luck went. And if any remained to me, how could I care to use them?\nAfter what you have told me too. My life is over, my life is dead.""\n\nAll the maids agreed at this point, and would scorn to contradict, that\npoor Squire Philip fell down in a lump, and they must have run in with\ntheir bottles and so on, only that the door was locked. Moreover, they\nfelt, and had the courage to whisper to one another, that they were a\nlittle timid of the Parson\'s witchcraft. There had been a girl in\nSherwell parish who went into the Parson\'s service, and because she\ndared to have a sweetheart on the premises, she had orders for half an\nhour, before and after the moon rose, to fly up and down the river Yeo,\nfrom Sherwell Mill to Pilton Bridge; and her own mother had seen her.\nTherefore these maids only listened.\n\n""All this shows a noble vein of softness in you, my good friend""--this\nwas the next thing they could hear--""it is truly good and grand. What a\nhappy thing to have a darling wife and two sweet children, for the\npurpose of having them slain, and then in the grandeur of soul\nforgiving it! This is noble, this is true love! How it sets one\nthinking!"" This was the last that the maids could hear; for after that\nall was whispering. Only it was spread in every street, and road, and\nlane around, in about twelve hours afterwards, that a warrant from\nJustices Chowne and Rambone, and, with consent of Philip Bampfylde, was\nplaced in the hands of the officers of the peace for the apprehension of\nCaptain Drake, upon a charge of murder.\n\nWhen Sir Philip heard of this outrage on himself--and tenfold\nworse--upon their blameless lineage, he ordered his finest horse to be\nsaddled, and put some of his army-clothes on; not his best, for fear of\nvaunting, but enough to know him by. Then he rode slowly up and down the\nnarrow streets of Barnstaple, and sent for the mayor and the\ntown-council, who tumbled out of their shops to meet him. To these he\nread a copy of the warrant, obtained from the head-constable, and asked,\nupon what information laid, such a thing had issued. Betwixt their\nrespect for Sir Philip Bampfylde and their awe of Parson Chowne, these\npoor men knew not what to say, but to try to be civil to every one. Sir\nPhilip rode home to Narnton Court, and changed his dress, and his horse\nas well, and thus set off for Chowne\'s house.\n\nWhat happened there was known to none except the two parsons and the\nGeneral; but every one was amazed when Chowne, in company with Parson\nJack, rode into Barnstaple at full gallop, and redemanded his warrant\nfrom the head-constable, who held it, and also caused all entries and\ncopies thereof to be destroyed and erased, as might be; and for this he\ncondescended to assign no reason. In that last point he was consistent\nwith his usual character; but that he should undo his own act, was so\nunlike himself that no one could at first believe it. Of course people\nsaid that it was pity for Sir Philip\'s age and character and position,\nthat made him relent so: but others, who knew the man better, perceived\nthat he had only acted as from the first was his intention. He knew that\nthe Captain could not be taken, of course, for many a month to come, and\nhe did not mean to have him taken or put upon his trial; for he knew\nright well that there was no chance of getting him convicted. But by\nissue of that warrant he had stirred up and given shape to all the\nsuspicions now languishing, and had enabled good honest people to lay\ntheir heads together and shake them, and the boldest of them to whisper\nthat if a common man had done this deed, or been called in question of\nit, the warrant would have held its ground, until he faced an impartial\njury of his fellow-countrymen. And what was far more to Chowne\'s\npurpose, he had thus contrived to spread between Sir Philip and his\neldest son a deadly breach, unlikely ever to be bridged across at all,\nand quite sure to stand wide for healing, up to the dying hour. Because\nit was given to all to know that this vile warrant issued upon oath of\nSquire Philip and by his demanding; and the father\'s pride would never\nlet him ask if this were so.\n\nNow people tried to pass this over, as they do with unpleasant matters,\nand to say, ""let bygones go;"" yet mankind will never have things\nsmothered thus, and put away. When a game is begun, it should be played\nout: when a battle is fought, let it be fought out--these are principles\nquite as strong in the bosoms of spectators, as in our own breasts the\nfeeling--""let us live our lives out.""\n\nBut Isabel Carey\'s wrath would not have any reason laid near it. Her\nspirit was as fine and clear almost as her lovely face was, and she\nwould not even dream that evil may get the upper hand of us.\n\nShe said to Sir Philip, ""I will not have it. I will not stay in a house\nwhere such things can be said of any one. I am very nearly eighteen\nyears old, and I will not be made a child of. You have been wonderfully\nkind and good, and as dear to me as a father; but I must go away now; I\nmust go away.""\n\n""So you shall,"" said poor Sir Philip; ""it is the best thing that can be\ndone. You have another guardian, more fortunate than I am; and, my dear,\nyou shall go to him.""\n\nThen she clung to his neck, and begged and prayed him not to think of it\nmore, only to let her stop where she was, in the home of all her\nhappiness. But the General was worse to move than the rock of Gibraltar,\nwhenever his honour was touched upon.\n\n""My dear Isabel,"" he answered, ""you are young, and I am old. You were\nquicker than I have been, to see what harm might come to you. That is\nthe very thing which I am bound to save you from, my darling. I love you\nas if you were my own daughter; and this sad house will be, God knows,\ntenfold more sad without you. But it must be so, my child. You ought to\nbe too proud to cry, when I turn you out so.""\n\nNot to dwell upon things too much--especially when grievous--Narnton\nCourt was compelled to get on without that bright young Isabel, and the\nfemale tailors who were always coming after her, as well as the noble\ngallants who hankered, every now and then, for a glimpse of her beauty\nand property. Isabel Carey went away to her other guardian, Lord\nPomeroy, at a place where a castle of powder was; and all the old people\nat Narnton Court determined not to think of it; while all the young folk\nsobbed and cried; and take it on the average, a guinea a-year was lost\nto them.\n\nAll this had happened for seven years now: but it was that last piece of\nnews, no doubt, almost as much as the warrant itself, that made our\nCaptain carry on so when we were in the lime-kiln. Because Lord Pomeroy\nhad forbidden Isabel to write to her lover, while in this predicament.\nHe, on the other hand, getting no letters, without knowing why or\nwherefore, was too proud to send any to her.\n\nWe saw the force of this at once, especially after our own\ncorrespondence (under both mark and signature) had for years been like\nthe wind, going where it listeth. So we resolved to stop where we were,\nupon receipt of rations; and Heaviside told us not to be uneasy about\nanything. For although he durst not invite us to his own little cottage,\nor rather his wife Nanette\'s, he stood so well in the cook\'s good graces\nthat he could provide for us; so he took us into the kitchen of Narnton\nCourt, where they made us very welcome as Captain Drake\'s retainers, and\ntold us all that had happened since the departure of Miss Isabel,\nbetween Narnton Court and Nympton. In the first place, Parson Chowne had\nbeen so satisfied with his mischief, that he spared himself time for\nanother wedlock, taking as Mrs Chowne No. 4 a young lady of some wealth\nand beauty, but reputed such a shrew that nobody durst go near her.\nBefore she had been Mrs Chowne a fortnight, her manners were so much\nimproved that a child might contradict her; and within a month she had\nlost the power of frowning, but had learned to sigh. However, she was\nstill alive, having a stronger constitution than any of the Parson\'s\nformer wives.\n\nParson Jack had also married, and his wife was a good one; but Chowne\n(being out of other mischief) sowed such jealousies between them for his\nown enjoyment, that poor Master Rambone had taken to drink, and his wife\nwas so driven that she almost did the thing she was accused of. Very\nseldom now did either of these two great parsons come to visit Sir\nPhilip Bampfylde. Not that the latter entertained any ill-will towards\nChowne for the matter of the warrant. For that he blamed his own son,\nthe Squire, having received Chowne\'s version of it, and finding poor\nPhilip too proud and moody to offer any explanation.\n\nWe had not been at Narnton Court more than a night, before I saw the\nbrave General; for hearing that I was in the house, and happening now to\nremember my name, he summoned me into his private room, to ask about the\nCaptain, who had started off (as I felt no doubt) for the castle of Lord\nPomeroy. I found Sir Philip looking of course much older from the seven\nyears past, but as upright and dignified, and trustful in the Lord as\never. Nevertheless he must have grown weaker, though he did his best to\nhide it; for at certain things I told him of his favourite son, great\ntears came into his eyes, and his thin lips trembled, and he was forced\nto turn away without finishing his sentences. Then he came back, as if\nashamed of his own desire to hide no shame, and he put his flowing white\nhair back, and looked at me very steadily.\n\n""Llewellyn,"" he said, ""I trust in God. Years of trouble have taught me\nthat. I speak to you as a friend almost, from your long acquaintance\nwith my son, and knowledge of our story. My age will be three score\nyears and ten, if I live (please God) till my next birthday. But I tell\nyou, David Llewellyn, and I beg you to mark my words, I shall not die\nuntil I have seen the whole of this mystery cleared off, the honour of\nmy name restored, and my innocent son replaced in the good opinion of\nmankind.""\n\nThis calm brave faith of a long-harassed man in the goodness of his\nMaker made me look at him with admiration and with glistening eyes; for\nI said to myself that with such a deep knave as Chowne at the bottom of\nhis troubles, his confidence even in the Lord was very likely to be\nmisplaced. And yet the very next day we made an extraordinary discovery,\nwhich went no little way to prove the soundness of the old man\'s faith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nA BREATHLESS DISINTERMENT.\n\n\nBy this time we were up to all the ins and outs of everything. A sailor\nhas such a knowledge of knots, and the clever art of splicing, that you\ncannot play loose tricks, in trying on a yarn with him. Jerry Toms and I\nwere ready, long before that day was out, to tie up our minds in a\nbow-line knot, and never more undo them. Jerry went even beyond my\nviews, as was sure to be, because he knew so much less of the matter; he\nwould have it that Parson Chowne had choked the two children without any\naid, and then in hatred and mockery of the noble British uniform, had\nburied them deep in Braunton Burrows, wearing a cockade for a shovel\nhat, purely by way of outrage.\n\nOn the other hand, while I agreed with Jerry up to a certain distance, I\nknew more of Parson Chowne (whom he never had set eyes upon) than to\nlisten to such rubbish. And while we agreed in the main so truly, and\nthoroughly praised each other\'s wisdom, all the people in the house made\nso highly much of us, that Jerry forgot the true line of reasoning, even\nbefore nine o\'clock at night, and dissented from my conclusions so\nwidely, and with so much arrogance, that it did not grieve me (after he\ngot up) to have knocked him down like a ninepin.\n\nHowever, in the morning he was all right, and being informed upon every\nside that the cook did it with the rolling-pin, he acknowledged the\njustice of it, having paid more attention to her than a married lady\nshould admit, though parted from her husband. However, she forgave him\nnobly, and he did the same to her; and I, with all my knowledge of\nwomen, made avowal in the presence of the lady-housekeeper, that my only\nuneasiness was to be certain whether I ought to admire the more Jerry\'s\nbehaviour or Mrs Cook\'s. And the cook had no certainty in the morning,\nexactly what she might have done.\n\nThis little matter made a stir far beyond its value; and having some\nknowledge of British nature, I proposed to the comitatus, with deference\nboth to the cook and housekeeper, also a glance at the first housemaid,\nthat we should right all misunderstanding by dining together\ncomfortably, an hour before the usual time. Because, as I clearly\nexpressed it, yet most inoffensively, our breakfast had been ruined by a\npiece, I might say, of misconstruction overnight between two admirable\npersons. And Heaviside came in just then, and put the cap on all of it,\nby saying that true sailors were the greatest of all sportsmen;\ntherefore, in honour of our arrival, he had asked, and got leave from\nthe gamekeepers, to give a great rabbiting that afternoon down on\nBraunton Burrows; and he hoped that Mrs Cockhanterbury, being the\nlady-housekeeper, would grace the scene with her presence, and let every\nmaid come to the utmost.\n\nHeaviside\'s speech, though nothing in itself, neither displaying any\nmanner at all, was received with the hottest applause; and for some time\nJerry and I had to look at one another, without any woman to notice us.\nWe made allowance for this, of course, although we did not like it. For,\nafter all, who was Heaviside? But we felt so sorely the ill effects of\nthe absence of perfect harmony upon the preceding evening (when all our\nmale members of the human race took more or less the marks of knuckles),\nthat a sense of stiffness helped us to make no objection to anything.\nAnd tenfold thus, when we saw how the maids had made up their minds for\nfrolicking.\n\nThese young things must have their way, as well as the nobler lot of us:\nfor they really have not so very much less of mind than higher women\nhave; and they feel what a woman is too well to push themselves so\nforward. They know their place, and they like their place, and they\ntempt us down into it.\n\nBe that either way--and now unwomanly women waste their good brains upon\na trifle of this kind--rabbiting was to be our sport; and no sooner was\nthe dinner done, and ten minutes given to the maids to dress, than every\ndog on the premises worth his salt was whistled for. It would have\namused you to see the maids, or I might say all the womankind, coming\nout with their best things on, and their hair done up, and all\npretending never even to have seen a looking-glass.\n\nMadame Heaviside (as she commanded all people to entitle her) was of the\nwhole the very grandest as regards appearance. Also in manner and\ncarrying on; but of this I have no time to speak. Enough that the former\nNaval Instructor thought it wiser to keep his own place, and let her\nflirt with the game keepers. We had dogs, and ferrets, and nets, and\nspades, and guns for those who were clever enough to keep from letting\nthem off at all, and to frighten the women without any harm. There must\nhave been five-and-twenty of us in number altogether, besides at least a\nscore of children who ran down from Braunton village, when they saw what\nwe were at. There was no restraint laid upon us by any presence of the\ngentry; for Sir Philip was not in the humour for sport, and the Squire\nof course kept himself to his room; and as for the Captain, we had no\ntoken of his return from South Devon yet.\n\nTherefore we had the most wonderful fun, enjoying the wildness of\nthe place, and the freshness of the river air, and wilfulness of\nthe sandhills, also the hide-and-seek of the rushes, and the many\nups and downs and pleasure of helping the young women in and out,\nalso how these latter got (if they had any feet to be proud of)\ninto rabbit-holes on purpose to be lifted out of them, and fill the\nrosettes of their shoes, and have them dusted by a naval man\'s very\nbest pocket-handkerchief--together with a difficulty of standing on one\nfoot while doing it, or having it done to them, and a fear of breathing\ntoo much out--after smothered rabbit at dinner-time--which made their\nfigures look beautiful. Enough that I took my choice among them, for\nconsideration; and jotted down the names of three, who must have\nsome cash from their petticoats. Let nobody for a moment dream that\nI started with this intention. The rest of my life was to be devoted\nto the Royal Navy, if only a hot war should come again; of which we\nalready felt simmerings. But I could not regard all these things, after\nso many years at sea, without some desire for further acquaintance with\nthe meaning of everything. At sea we forget a great deal of their ways.\nWhen we come ashore--there they are again!\n\nThis is a very childish thing for a man like me to think of.\nNevertheless I do fall back from perfect propriety sometimes; never as\nregards money; but when my feelings are touched by the way in which\nsuperior young women try to catch me; or when my opinion is asked\nconscientiously as to cordials. And this same afternoon the noble\nclearness of the sun and air, and the sound of merry voices glancing\nwhere all the world (unless it were soft sand) would have echoed them,\nand the sense of going sporting--which is half the game of it--these and\nother things, as well as the fatness of the rabbits\' backs, and great\nskill not to bruise them, led the whole of us, more or less, into\ncontemplation of Nature\'s beauties. We must have killed more than a\nhundred and fifty coneys, in one way and another, when Heaviside came\nup, almost at a run, to a hill where Jerry Toms and I were sitting down,\nto look about a bit, and to let the young women admire us.\n\n""What\'s the matter?"" said I, not liking to be interrupted thus.\n\n""Matter enough,"" he panted out; ""where is Madame? The Lord keep her\naway.""\n\n""Madame is gone down to the water-side,"" said Jerry, though I frowned at\nhim, ""together with that smart young fellow--I forget his\nname--under-keeper they call him.""\n\n""Hurrah, my hearties!"" cried Heaviside; ""that is luck, and no mistake.\nNow lend a hand, every lubber of you. Her pet dog Snap is in the sand;\n\'with the devil to pay, and no pitch hot,\' if we take long to get him\nout again.""\n\nWe knew what he meant; for several dogs of an over-zealous character had\ngot into premature burial in the rabbit-galleries, through the stupidity\nof people who crowded upon the cone over them. Some had been dug out\nalive, and some dead, according to what their luck was. And now we were\nbound to dig out poor Snap, and woe to us all if we found him dead!\n\nI took the biggest spade, as well as the entire command of all of us,\nand we started at quick step for the place which Heaviside pointed out\nto us. He told us, so far as his breath allowed, that his small brown\nterrier Snap had found a rabbit of tender age hiding in a tuft of\nrushes. Snap put all speed on at once, but young bunny had the heels of\nhim, and flipped up her tail at the mouth of a hole, with an air of\ndefiance which provoked Snap beyond all discretion. He scarcely stopped\nto think before he plunged with a yelp into the hole, while another and\na wiser dog came up, and shook his ears at it. For a little while they\nheard poor Snap working away in great ecstasy, scratching at narrow\nturns, and yelping when he almost got hold of fur. Heaviside stood, in\nhis heavy way, whistling into the entrance-hole, which went down from a\nsteep ascent with a tuft of rushes over it. But Snap was a great deal\ntoo gamesome a dog to come back--even if he heard him. Meanwhile a lot\nof bulky fellows, who could do no more than clap their hands, got on the\nbrow of the burrow and stamped, and shouted to Snap to dig deeper. Then\nof a sudden the whole hill slided, as a hollow fire does, and cast a\ngreat part of itself into a deep gully on the north of it. And those\ngreat louts who had sent it down so, found it very hard (and never\ndeserved) to get their clumsy legs out.\n\nNo wonder that Heaviside had made such a run to come and fetch us. For\nSnap must be now many feet underground, and the Naval Instructor knew\nwhat it would be to go home to Nanette without him. He stood above the\nslip and listened, and there was no bark of Snap; while to my mind came\nback strangely thoughts of the five poor sons of Sker, and of the little\nchild dwelling in sand, forlorn and abandoned Bardie.\n\n""Dig away, my lads, dig away!"" I cried, from force of memory, and\nsetting example to every one; ""I have seen a thing like this before; it\nonly wants quick digging."" We dug and dug, and drove our pit through\nseveral decks of rabbit-berths; and still I cried ""Dig on, my lads!""\nalthough they said it was hopeless. Then suddenly some one struck\nsomething hard, and cried ""Halloa!"" and frightened us. We crowded round,\nand I took the lead, and made the rest keep back from me, in right of\nsuperior discipline. And thence I heaved out a beautiful cocked-hat of a\nBritish Captain of the Royal Navy, with Snap inside of it and not quite\ndead!\n\nSuch a cheer and sound arose (the moment that Snap gave a little sniff),\nfrom universal excitement and joy, with Heaviside at the head of it,\nthat I feared to be hoisted quite out of the hole, and mounted on human\nshoulders. This I like well enough now and then, having many a time\ndeserved without altogether ensuing it; but I could not stop to think of\nany private triumph now. The whole of my heart was hot inside me,\nthrough what I was thinking of.\n\nThat poor honest fellow, who so eschewed the adornment of the outward\nman, and carried out pure Christianity so as to take no heed of what he\nwore, or whether he wore anything whatever; yet who really felt for\npeople of a weaker cultivation, to such an extreme that he hardly ever\nwent about by day much,--this noble man had given evidence such as no\nman, who had lost respect by keeping a tailor, could doubt of. In\nitself, it was perspicuous; and so was the witness, before he put up\nwith a sack, in order to tender it.\n\nThe whole force of this broke upon me now; while the others were showing\nthe hat round, or blowing into the little dog\'s nostrils, and with a\nrabbit\'s tail tickling him; because in a single glance I had seen that\nthe hat was our Captain Bampfylde\'s. And then I thought of old Sir\nPhilip, striding sadly along these burrows, for ever seeking something.\n\n""Dig away, dig away, my lads. Never mind the little dog. Let the maidens\nsee to him. Under our feet there is something now, worth a hundred\nthousand dogs.""\n\nAll the people stood and stared, and thought that I was off my wits; and\nbut for my uniform, not one would ever have stopped to harken me. It was\nuseless to speak to Heaviside. The whole of his mind was exhausted by\nanxiety as to his wife\'s little dog. No sleep could he see before him\nfor at least three lunar months, unless little Snap came round again. So\nI had to rely on myself alone, and Jerry Toms, and two gamekeepers.\n\nAll these were for giving up; because I can tell you it is no joke to\nthrow out spadeful after spadeful of this heavy deceitful sand, with\nhalf of it coming back into the hole; and the place where you stand not\nsteadfast. And the rushes were combing darkly over us, showing their\nginger-coloured roots, and with tufts of jagged eyebrows threatening\noverwhelment. For our lives we worked away--with me (as seems to be my\nfate) compelled to be the master--and all the people looking down, and\nready to revile us, if we could not find a stirring thing. But we did\nfind a stirring thing, exactly as I will tell you.\n\nFor suddenly my spade struck something soft, something which returned no\nsound, and yet was firm enough to stop, or at any rate to clog the tool.\nAlthough it was scarcely twilight yet, and many people stood around us,\na feeling not of fear so much as horror seized upon me. Because this was\nnot like the case of digging out poor bodies smothered by accident or\nthe will of God, but was something far more dreadful; proof, to wit, of\natrocious murder done by villany of mankind upon two little helpless\nbabes. So that I scarce could hold the spade, when a piece of white\nlinen appeared through the sand, and then some tresses of long fair\nhair, and then two little hands crossed on the breast, and a set of\nsmall toes sticking upward. And close at hand lay another young body, of\nabout the same size, or a trifle larger.\n\nAt this terrible sight, the deepest breath of awe drew through all of\nus, and several of the women upon the hill shrieked and dropped, and the\nchildren fled, and the men feared to come any nearer. Even my three or\nfour fellow-diggers leaped from the hole with alacrity, leaving me all\nby myself to go on with this piteous disinterment. For a moment I\ntrembled too much to do so, and leaned on my spade in the dusky grave,\nwatching the poor little things, and loath to break with sacrilegious\nhands such innocent and eternal rest. ""Ye pure and stainless souls,"" I\ncried, ""hovering even now above us, in your guardian angel\'s arms, and\nappealing for judgment on your icy-hearted murderer, pardon me for thus\ninvading, in the sacred cause of justice, the calm sleep of your\ntenements.""\n\nIn this sad and solemn moment, with all the best spectators moved to\ntears by my deep eloquence, as well as their own rich sympathies, it\nstruck me that the legs of one of the corpses stuck up rather strangely.\nI had not been taken aback, at all, by the bright preservation of hands\nand toes, because I knew well what the power of sand is when the air is\nkept far away; but it was dead against all my experience, that even a\nbaby, eight years buried, should have that muscular power of leg.\nWithout any further hesitation, up I caught the nearest of them, being\ndesperate now to know what would be the end of it.\n\nThree or four women, whose age had passed from lying in to laying out,\nnow ran down the hill in great zealousness; but though their profession\nis perhaps the most needful of all yet invented by human nature, there\nwas no exercise for it now. For behold, in the evening light, and on the\nbrink of the grave, were laid two very handsome and large Dutch dolls,\nclad in their night-gowns, and looking as fresh as when they left the\ndoll-maker\'s shop. The sand remained in their hair of course, and in\ntheir linen, but fell away (by reason of its dryness) from their faces,\nand hands, and feet, the whole of which were of fine hard wax. But the\njoints of their arms and legs had stiffened, from having no children to\nwork them, also their noses had been spoiled at some stage of their\nobsequies; and upon the whole it seemed hard to say whether their\nappearance was more ludicrous or deplorable.\n\nHowever, that matter was settled for them by the universal guffaw of the\nfellows who had been scared of their scanty wits not more than two\nminutes since, but all of whom now were as brave as lions to make\nlaughter at my expense. This is a thing which I never allow, but very\nsoon put a stop to it. And so I did now, without any hard words, but\nturning their thoughts discreetly.\n\n""Come, my lads,"" I said, ""we have done a better turn to the gentleman\nwho feeds us, than if we had found two thousand babies, such as you ran\naway from. Rally round me, if you have a spark of courage in your\nloutish bodies. You little know how much hangs on this; while in your\nclumsy witless way, you are making a stupid joke of it. Mr Heaviside, I\npray you, seek for me Mistress Cockhanterbury; while I knock down any\nrogue who shows the impudence to come near me.""\n\nEvery man pulled his proud stomach in, when I spoke of the\nlady-housekeeper, who was a Tartar, high up on a shelf, allowing no\nmargin for argument. She appeared in the distance, as managing-women\nalways do when called upon; and she saw the good sense of what little I\nsaid, and she laid them all under my orders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nONE WHO HAS INTERRED HIMSELF.\n\n\nSuch an effect was now produced all over all around us, that every man\npressed for his neighbour\'s opinion, rather than offer his own, almost.\nThis is a state of the public mind that cannot be long put up with; for\nhalf the pleasure goes out of life when a man is stinted of argument.\nBut inasmuch as I was always ready for all comers, and would not for a\nmoment harken any other opinion, the great bulk of conclusion ran into\nthe grooves I laid for it.\n\nThis was neither more nor less than that Satan\'s own chaplain, Chowne,\nwas at the helm of the whole of it. Some people said that I formed this\nopinion through an unchristian recollection of his former rudeness to\nme; I mean when he blew me out of bed, and tried to drown, and to burn\nme alive. However, the great majority saw that my nature was not of this\nsort, but rather inclined to reflect with pleasure upon any spirited\nconduct. And to tell the whole truth, upon looking back at the Parson, I\nadmired him more than any other man I had seen, except Captain Nelson.\nFor it is so rare to meet with a man who knows his own mind thoroughly,\nthat if you find him add thereto a knowledge of his neighbours\' minds,\ncertain you may be that here is one entitled to lead the nation. He may\nbe almost too great to care about putting this power in exercise, unless\nany grand occasion betides him; just as Parson Chowne refused to go into\nthe bishopric; and just as Nelson was vexed at being the supervisor of\nsmugglers. Nevertheless these men are ready, when God sees fit to\nappoint them.\n\nHowever, to come back to these dolls, and the opening now before them.\nThe public (although at first disappointed not to have found two real\nbabies strangled in an experienced manner) perceived the expediency of\nrejoicing in the absence of any such horror. Only there were many\npeople, of the lower order, so disgusted at this cheat, and strain upon\ntheir glands of weeping, with no blood to show for it, that they\ndeclared their firm resolve to have nothing more to do with it.\n\nFor my part, being some little aware of the way in which laurels are\nstolen, I kept my spade well up, and the two dolls in my arms, with\ntheir heads down, and even their feet grudged to the view of the\ngossipers. In the midst of an excited mob, a calm sight of the right\nthing to do may lead them almost anywhere. And I saw that the only\nproper thing was to leave everything to me. They (with that sense of\nfairness which exists in slow minds more than in quick ones) fell behind\nme, because all knew that the entire discovery was my own. Of course\nwithout Snap I could never have done it; nor yet without further\naccidents: still there it was; and no man even of our diffident Welsh\nnation, can in any fairness be expected to obscure himself.\n\nMy tendency, throughout this story, always has been to do this. But I\nreally did begin to feel the need of abjuring this national fault, since\nmen of a mixture of any sort, without even Celtic blood in them, over\nand over again had tried to make a mere nobody of me.\n\nHence it was, and not from any desire to advance myself, that among the\ninferior race, I stood upon my rights, and stuck to them. If ever there\nhad been any drop of desire for money left in me, after perpetual\npurification (from seven years of getting only coppers, and finding most\nof them forgeries), this scene was alone sufficient to make me glad of\nan empty purse. For any man who has any money must long to put more to\nit; as the children pile their farthings, hoping how high they may go. I\nlike to see both old and young full of schemes so noble; only they must\nlet an ancient fellow like me keep out of them.\n\nThese superior senses glowed within me, and would not be set aside by\nany other rogue preceding me, when I knocked at Sir Philip\'s door, and\nclaimed first right of audience. The other fellows were all put away by\nthe serving-men, as behoved them; then I carried in everything, just as\nit was, and presented the whole with the utmost deference.\n\nSir Philip had inkling of something important, and was beginning to\nshake now and then; nevertheless he acknowledged my entrance with his\nwonted dignity; signed to the footman to refresh the sperm-oil lamps in\nthe long dark room; and then to me to come and spread my burden on a\ntable. Nothing could more clearly show the self-command which a good man\nwins by wrestling long with adversity. For rumour had reached him that I\nhad dug up his son\'s cocked-hat, and his two grandchildren, all as fresh\nas the day itself. It is not for me (who have never been so deeply\nstirred in the grain of the heart by heaven\'s visitations) to go through\nand make a show of this most noble and ancient gentleman\'s doings, or\nfeelings, or language even. A man of low station, like myself, would be\nloath to have this done to him, at many and many a time of his life; so\n(if I could even do it in the case of a man so far above me, and so far\nmore deeply harrowed) instead of being proud of describing, I must only\ndespise myself.\n\nEnough to say that this snowy-haired, most simple yet stately gentleman,\nmixed the usual mixture of the things that weep and the things that\nlaugh; which are the joint-stock of our nature, from the old Adam and\nthe young one. What I mean--if I keep to facts--is, that he knelt on a\nstrip of canvas laid at the end of the table, and after some trouble to\nplace his elbows (because of the grit of the sandiness), bowed his white\nforehead and silvery hair, and the calm majesty of his face, over those\ntwo dollies, and over his son\'s very best cocked-hat, and in silence\nwept thanksgiving to the great Father of everything.\n\n""David Llewellyn,"" he said, as he rose and approached me as if I were\nquite his equal; ""allow me to take your hand, my friend. There are few\nmen to whom I would sooner owe this great debt of gratitude than\nyourself, because you have sailed with my son so long. To you and your\npatience and sagacity, under the mercy of God, I owe the proof, or at\nany rate these tokens of my poor son\'s innocence. I--I thank the Lord\nand you----""\n\nHere the General for the moment could not say another word.\n\n""It is true, your Worship,"" I answered, ""that none of your own people\nshowed the sense or the courage to go on. But it is a Welshman\'s honest\npride to surpass all other races in valour and ability. I am no more\nthan the very humblest of my ancestors may have been.""\n\n""Then all of them must have been very fine fellows,"" Sir Philip replied,\nwith a twinkling glance. ""But now I will beg of you one more favour.\nCarry all these things, just as they are, to the room of my son, Mr\nPhilip Bampfylde.""\n\nAt first I was so taken aback that I could only gaze at him. And then I\nbegan to think, and to see the reason of his asking it.\n\n""I have asked you to do a strange thing, good David; if it is an\nunpleasant one, say so in your blunt sailor\'s fashion.""\n\n""Your honour,"" I answered, with all the delicacy of my nature upwards;\n""say not another word. I will do it.""\n\nFor truly to speak it, if anything had been often a grief and a care to\nme, it was the bitterness of thinking of that Squire Philip deeply, and\nnot knowing anything. The General bowed to me with a kindness none could\ntake advantage of, and signalled me to collect my burden. Then he\nappointed me how to go, together with a very old and long-accustomed\nservitor. Himself would not come near his son, for fear of triumph over\nhim.\n\nAfter a long bit of tapping, and whispering, and the mystery servants\nalways love to make of the simplest orders, I was shown with my arms\nwell aching (for those wooden dolls were no joke, and the Captain\'s hat\nweighed a stone at least, with all the sand in the lining) into a dark\nroom softly strewn, and hung with ancient damask. The light of the\nevening was shut out, and the failure of the candles made it seem a\ncloudy starlight. Only in the furthest corner there was light enough to\nsee by; and there sate, at a very old desk, a white-haired man with his\nhat on.\n\nIf I can say one thing truly (while I am striving at every line to tell\nthe downright honesty), this truth is that my bones and fibres now grew\ncold inside of me. There was about this man, so placed, and with the\ndimness round him, such an air of difference from whatever we can reason\nwith, and of far withdrawal from the ways of human nature, as must send\na dismal shudder through a genial soul like mine. There he sate, and\nthere he spent three parts of his time with his hat on, gazing at some\nold grey tokens of a happy period, but (so far as could be judged)\nhoping, fearing, doing, thinking, even dreaming--nothing! He would not\nallow any clock or watch, or other record of time in the chamber, he\nwould not read or be read to, neither write or receive a letter.\n\nThere he sate, with one hand on his forehead pushing back the old dusty\nhat, with his white hair straggling under it and even below the gaunt\nshoulder-blades, his face set a little on one side, without any kind of\nmeaning in it, unless it were long weariness, and patient waiting God\'s\ntime of death.\n\nI was told that once a-day, whenever the sun was going down over the\nbar, in winter or summer, in wet or dry, this unfortunate man arose, as\nif he knew the time by instinct without view of heaven, and drew the\nvelvet curtain back and flung the shutter open, and for a moment stood\nand gazed with sorrow-worn yet tearless eyes upon the solemn hills and\nwoods, and down the gliding of the river, following the pensive footfall\nof another receding day. Then with a deep sigh he retired from all\nchance of starlight, darkening body, mind, and soul, until another\nsunset.\n\nUpon the better side of my heart, I could feel true pity for a man\noverwhelmed like this by fortune; while my strength of mind was vexed to\nsee him carry on so. Therefore straight I marched up to him, when I\nbegan to recover myself, having found no better way of getting through\nperplexity.\n\nAs my footsteps sounded heavily in the gloomy chamber, Squire Philip\nturned, and gazed at first with cold displeasure, and then with strong\namazement at me. I waited for him to begin, but he could not, whether\nfrom surprise or loss of readiness through such long immurement.\n\n""May it please your Honour,"" I said; ""the General has sent me hither to\nclear my Captain from the charge of burying your Honour\'s children.""\n\n""What--what do you mean?"" was all that he could stammer forth, while his\nglassy eyes were roving from my face to the dolls I bore, and round the\nroom, and then back again.\n\n""Exactly as I say, your Honour. These are what the wild man took for\nyour two children in Braunton Burrows; and here is the Captain\'s\ncocked-hat, which some one stole, to counterfeit him. The whole thing\nwas a vile artifice, a delusion, cheat, and mockery.""\n\nI need not repeat how I set this before him, but only his mode of\nreceiving it. At first he seemed wholly confused and stunned, pressing\nhis head with both hands, and looking as if he knew not where he was.\nThen he began to enter slowly into what I was telling him, but without\nthe power to see its bearing, or judge how to take it. He examined the\ndolls, and patted them, and added them to a whole school which he kept,\nwith two candles burning before them. And then he said, ""They have long\nbeen missing: I am pleased to recover them.""\n\nThen for a long time he sate in silence, and in his former attitude,\nquite as if his mind relapsed into its old condition: and verily I began\nto think that the only result of my discovery, so far as concerned poor\nSquire Philip, would be a small addition to his gallery of dolls.\nHowever, after a while he turned round, and cried with a piercing gaze\nat me--\n\n""Mariner, whoever you are, I do not believe one word of your tale. The\nhat is as new and the dolls are as fresh as if they were buried\nyesterday. And I take that to be the truth of it. How many years have I\nbeen here? I know not. Bring me a looking-glass.""\n\nHe pointed to a small mirror which stood among his precious relics.\nBeing mounted with silver and tortoise-shell, this had been (as they\ntold me afterwards) the favourite toy of his handsome wife. When I\nhanded him this, he took off his hat, and shook his white hair back, and\ngazed earnestly, but without any sorrow, at his mournful image.\n\n""Twenty years at least,"" he pronounced it, in a clear decided voice;\n""twenty years it must have taken to have made me what I am. Would twenty\nyears in a dripping sandhill leave a smart gentleman\'s laced hat and a\npoor little baby\'s dolls as fresh and bright as the day they were\nburied? Old mariner, I am sorry that you should lend yourself to such\ndevices. But perhaps you thought it right.""\n\nThis, although so much perverted, made me think of his father\'s goodness\nand kind faith in every one. And I saw that here was no place now for\nany sort of argument.\n\n""Your Honour is altogether wrong,"" I answered, very gently: ""the matter\ncould have been, at the utmost, scarcely more than eight years ago,\naccording to what they tell me. And if you can suppose that a man of my\nrank and age and service would lend himself to mean devices, there are\nat least thirty of your retainers, and of honest neighbours, who have\nseen the whole thing and can swear to its straightforwardness. And your\nHonour, of course, knows everything a thousand times better than I do;\nbut of sand, and how it keeps things everlasting (so long as dry), your\nHonour seems, if I may say it, to have no experience.""\n\nHe did not take the trouble to answer, but fell back into his old way of\nsitting, as if there was nothing worth argument.\n\nPeople say that every man is like his father in many ways; but the\nfirst resemblance that I perceived between Sir Philip and his elder son\nwas, that the squire arose and bowed with courtesy as I departed.\n\nUpon the whole, this undertaking proved a disappointment to me. And it\nmattered a hundredfold as much that our noble General was not only\nvexed, but angered more than one could hope of him. Having been treated\na little amiss, I trusted that Sir Philip would contribute to my\nself-respect by also feeling angry. Still I did not desire more than\njust enough to support me, or at the utmost to overlap me, and give me\nthe sense of acting aright by virtue of appeasing him. But on the\npresent occasion he showed so large and cloudy a shape of anger, wholly\nwithdrawn from my sight (as happens with the Peak of Teneriffe)--also he\nso clearly longed to be left alone and meditate, that I had no chance to\noffer him more than three opinions. All these were of genuine value at\nthe time of offering; and must have continued so to be, if the facts had\nnot belied them. Allowing for this adverse view, I will not even state\nthem.\n\nNevertheless I had the warmest invitation to abide, and be welcome to\nthe best that turned upon any of all the four great spits, or simmered\nand lifted the pot-lids suddenly for a puff of fine smell to come out in\nadvance. To a man of less patriotic feeling this might thus have\ncommended itself. But to my mind there was nothing visible in these\nhills and valleys, and their sloping towards the sea, which could make a\ntrue Welshman doubt the priority of Welshland. For with us the sun is\nbetter, and the air moves less in creases, and the sea has more of rapid\ngaiety in breaking. The others may have higher diffs, or deeper valleys\ndown them, also (if they like to think so) darker woods for robbers\'\nnests--but our own land has a sweetness, and a gentle liking for us, and\na motherly pleasure in its bosom when we do come home to it, such as no\nother land may claim--according to my experience.\n\nThese were my sentiments as I climbed, upon the ensuing Sunday, a lofty\nhill near the Ilfracombe road, commanding a view of the Bristol Channel\nand the Welsh coast beyond it. The day was so clear that I could follow\nthe stretches and curves of my native shore, from the low lands of Gower\naway in the west through the sandy ridges of Aberavon and the grey rocks\nof Sker and Porthcawl, as far as the eastern cliffs of Dunraven and the\nfading bend of St Donat\'s.\n\nThe sea between us looked so calm, and softly touched with shaded lights\nand gentle variations, also in unruffled beauty so fostering and\nbenevolent, that the white sailed coasters seemed to be babies fast\nasleep on their mother\'s lap.\n\n""How long is this mere river to keep me from my people at home?"" I\ncried; ""it looks as if one could jump it almost! A child in a\ncockleshell could cross it.""\n\nAt these words of my own, a sudden thought, which had never occurred\nbefore, struck me so that my brain seemed to buzz.\n\nBut presently reason came to my aid; and I said, ""No, no; it is out of\nthe question; without even a thread of sail! I must not let these clods\nlaugh at me for such a wild idea. And the name in the stern of the boat\nas well, downright \'Santa Lucia!\' Chowne must have drowned those two\npoor children, and then rehearsed this farce of a burial with the\nCaptain\'s hat on, to enable his man to swear truly to it. Tush, I am not\nin my dotage yet. I can see the force of everything.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nA BRAVE MAN RUNS AWAY.\n\n\nIt may be the power of honesty, or it may be strength of character\ncoupled with a more than usual brightness of sagacity--but whatever the\ncause may be, the result seems always to be the same, in spite of inborn\nhumility--to wit, that poor old Davy Llewellyn, wherever his ups and\ndowns may throw him, always has to take the lead! This necessity, as\nusual, seemed to be arising now at Narnton Court--the very last place in\nthe world where one could have desired it. Since the present grand war\nbegan (with the finest promise of lasting, because nobody knows any\ncause for it, so that it must be a law of nature), I have not found much\noccasion to dwell upon common inland incidents. These are in nature so\nfar below all maritime proceedings, that a sailor is tempted to forget\nsuch trifles as people are doing ashore.\n\nEven upon Holy Scripture (since the stirring times began for me\nhenceforth to chronicle), it has not been my good-luck to be able to sit\nand think of anything. Nevertheless I am almost sure that it must have\nbeen an active man of the name of Nehemiah, who drew for his rations\nevery day, one fat ox, and six choice sheep, and fowls of order various.\n\nAll of these might I have claimed, if my capacity had been equal to this\ngreat occasion. Hence it may be well supposed that the kitchen was my\nfavourite place, whenever I deigned to enter into converse with the\nservants. At first the head-cook was a little shy; but I put her soon at\nher ease by describing (from my vast breadth of experience) the proper\nmanner to truss and roast a man--and still better a woman. The knowledge\nI displayed upon a thing so far above her level, coupled with my tales\nof what we sailors did in consequence, led this excellent creature so to\nappreciate my character, and thirst for more of my narratives, that I\nnever could come amiss, even at dishing-up time.\n\nBut here I fell into a snare, as every seaman is sure to do when he\nrelaxes his mind too much in the charms of female society. Not\nconcerning the cook herself--for I gave her to understand at the outset\nthat I was not a marrying man, and she (possessing a husband somewhere)\nresolved not to hanker after me--but by means of a fair young maid,\nnewly apprenticed to our head-cook, although of a loftier origin.\n\nMore than once, while telling my stories, I had obtained a little\nglimpse of long bright ringlets flashing and of shy young eyes just\npeeping through the hatch of the scullery-door, where the huckaback\ntowel hung down from the roller. And then, on detection, there used to\nensue a very quick fumbling of small red hands, as if being dried with a\ndesperate haste in the old jack-towel; and then a short sigh, and light\nfeet retiring.\n\nWhen this had happened for three or four times, I gave my head-cook a\nsudden wink, and sprang through the scullery-door and caught the little\nred hands in the fold of the towel, and brought forth the owner, in\nspite of deep blushes, and even a little scream or two. Then I placed\nher in a chair behind the jack-chains, and continued my harrowing\ndescription of the way I was larded for roasting once; by a score of\nunclothed Gabooners. Also how the skewers of bar-wood thrust in to make\nme of a good rich colour, when I should come to table, had not that\ntenacity which our English wood is gifted with; so that I was enabled to\nshake (after praying to God for assistance) my right arm out, and then\nmy left; and after clapping both together (to restore circulation), it\ncame providentially into my head to lay hold of the spit and charge\nthem. And then ensued such a scene as I could not even think of laying\nbefore young and delicate females.\n\nThis young girl, whoso name was ""Polly,"" always (at this pitch of\nterror) not only shivered but shuddered so, and needed support for her\nfigure beyond the power of stays to communicate, also let such tears\nbegin to betray themselves and then retreat, and then come out and defy\nthe world, with a brave sob at their back almost,--that I do not\nexaggerate in saying how many times I had the pleasure of roasting\nmyself for the sake of them.\n\nHowever it always does turn out that pleasures of this sort are\ntransient; and I could not have been going on with Polly more than ten\ndays at the utmost, when I found myself in a rare scrape, to be sure.\nAnd this was the worse, because Sir Philip so strongly desired my\npresence now, perhaps in the vain hope of my convincing that obstinate\nSquire of his brother\'s innocence, when that brother should return.\n\nNow I need not have spoken as yet of Miss Polly if she had been but a\ncommon servant, because in that case her peace of mind would have been\nof no consequence to the household. But, as it happened, she was a\nperson of no small importance, by reason of the very lofty nature of her\nconnections: for she was no less than genuine niece to the\nlady-housekeeper Mrs Cockhanterbury herself. And hence she became the\ninnocent cause of my departure from Narnton Court, before I had time to\nbegin my inquiries about the two poor little children.\n\nThis I had made up my mind to do, as soon as that strange idea had\ncrossed it, while I was gazing upon the sea; and my meaning was to go\nthrough all the traces that might still be found of them, and the mode\nof their disappearance. It is true that this resolve was weakened by a\ntempest which arose that very same evening after the Channel had looked\nso insignificant, and which might have been expected after that\nappearance. Nevertheless I must have proceeded according to my\nintention, if my heart had not been too much for me in the matter of\nPolly Cockhanterbury.\n\nBeing just now in my sixtieth year, I could not prove such a coxcomb, of\ncourse, as to imagine that a pretty girl of two-and-twenty could care\nfor me, so that no course remained open to me as an honourable man and\ngallant British officer who studies his own peace of mind, except to\nwithdraw from this too tempting neighbourhood.\n\nAnd in this resolution I was confirmed by Mrs Cockhanterbury\'s\nreluctance to declare in a binding manner her intentions towards her\nniece. Also by finding that somehow or other the whole of the\nground-floor at Narnton Court had taken it into their heads to regard me\nas a man of desirable substance. It is possible that in larger moments,\nwhen other people were boasting, I may have insisted a little too much\nupon my position as landowner in the parish of Newton Nottage. Also I\nmay have described too warmly my patronage of the schoolmaster, and\ninvestment of cash with a view to encourage the literature of the\nparish. But I never could have said--what all of them deposed to--such a\nvery strong untruth, as to convey the conclusion (even to a Devonshire\nstate of mind), that Colonel Lougher and I divided the whole of the\nparish between us!\n\nBe that as it may, there was not any maid over thirty who failed to set\nher cap at me, and my silver hair was quite restored to a youthful tinge\nof gold. Hence I was horrified at the thought that Polly might even\nconsent to have me for the sake of my property, and upon discovering its\npoetical existence, lead me a perfectly wretched life, as bad as that of\npoor Heaviside.\n\nSo that, in spite of all attractions, and really serious business,\nand the important duty of awaiting the Captain\'s return from Pomeroy\nCastle, and even in spite of Jerry Toms\' offer to take Polly off my\nhands--as if she would say a word to him!--and all the adjurations of\npoor Heaviside, who had defied his wife (all the time I was there to\nback him up), and now must have to pay out for it--what did I do but\nagree to doff my uniform, and work my passage on board the Majestic, a\nfore-and-aft-rigged limestone boat of forty-eight tons and a half? Of\ncourse she was bound on the usual business of stealing the good Colonel\nLougher\'s rocks, but I distinctly stipulated to have nothing to do with\nthat.\n\nMy popularity now was such, with all ranks of society, also I found\nmyself pledged for so many stories that same evening, that I imparted to\nnone except Sir Philip, and Polly, and Jerry Toms, and Heaviside, and\none or two more, the scheme of my sudden departure. My mind was on the\npoint of changing when I beheld sweet Polly\'s tears, until I felt that I\nmust behave, at my time of life, as her father would; because she had no\nfather.\n\nWhen I brought the Majestic into shallow water off the Tuskar, every\ninch of which I knew, it was no small comfort to me that I could not\nsee the shore. For years I had longed to see that shore, and dreamed of\nit perpetually, while tossing ten thousand miles away; and now I was\nglad to have it covered with the twilight fogginess. It suited me better\nto land at night, only because my landing would not be such as I was\nentitled to. And every one knows how the Navy and Army drop in public\nestimation, when the wars seem to be done with. Therefore I expected\nlittle; and I give you my word that I got still less.\n\nIt may have been over eleven o\'clock, but at any rate nothing to call\nvery late, just at the crest of the summer-time, when I gave three good\nstrong raps at the door of my own cottage, knowing exactly where the\nknots were. I had not met a single soul to know me, or to speak my name,\nalthough the moon was a quarter old, and I found a broken spar, and bore\nit as I used to bear my fishing-pole.\n\nNo man who has not been long a-roving can understand all the fluttering\nways of a man\'s heart when he comes home again. How he looks at every\none of all the old houses he knows so well; at first as if he feared it\nfor having another piece built on, or grander people inside of it. And\nthen upon finding this fear vain, he is almost ready to beg its pardon\nfor not having looked at it such a long time. It is not in him to say a\nword to, or even about, the children coming out thus to stare at him.\nAll the children he used to know are gone to day\'s work long ago; and\nthe new ones would scarcely trust him so as to suck a foreign lollipop.\nHe knows them by their mothers; but he cannot use their names to them.\n\nThere is nothing solid dwelling for a poor man long away, except the big\ntrees that lay hold upon the ground in earnest, and the tomb-stones\nkeeping up his right to the parish churchyard. Along the wall of this I\nglanced, with joy to keep outside of it; while I struck, for the third\ntime strongly, at not being let into mine own house.\n\nAt last a weak and faltering step sounded in my little room, and then a\nvoice came through the latch-hole, ""Man of noise, how dare you thus? you\nwill wake up our young lady.""\n\n""Master Roger, let me in. Know you not your own landlord?""\n\nThe learned schoolmaster was so astonished that he could scarcely draw\nback the bolt. ""Is it so? Is it so indeed? I thank the Lord for sending\nthee,"" was all he could say, while he stood there shaking both my hands\nto the very utmost that his slender palms could compass.\n\n""Friend Llewellyn,"" he whispered at last, ""I beg thy pardon heartily,\nfor having been so rude to thee. But it is such a business to hush the\nyoung lady; and if she once wakes she talks all the night long. I fear\nthat her mind is almost too active for a maid of her tender years.""\n\n""What young lady do you mean?"" I asked; ""is Bunny become a young lady\nnow?""\n\n""Bunny!"" he cried, with no small contempt; then perceiving how rude this\nwas to me, began casting about for apologies.\n\n""Never mind that,"" I said; ""only tell me who this wonderful young lady\nis.""\n\n""Miss Andalusia, the \'Maid of Sker,\' as every one now begins to call\nher. There is no other young lady in the neighbourhood to my knowledge.""\n\n""Nor in the whole world for you, I should say, by the look of your eyes,\nMaster Roger Berkrolles. Nevertheless put your coat on, my friend, and\ngive your old landlord a bit to eat. I trow that the whole of my house\ndoes not belong even to Miss Delushy. Have I not even a granddaughter?""\n\n""To be sure, and a very fine damsel she is, ay, and a good and comely\none; though she hath no turn for erudition. What we should do without\nBunny I know not. She is a most rare young housewife.""\n\nThe tears sprang into my eyes at this, as I thought of her poor\ngrandmother, and I gave Master Berkrolles\' hand a squeeze which brought\nsome into his as well.\n\n""Let me see her,"" was all I said; ""it is not easy to break her rest,\nunless she is greatly altered.""\n\n""She is not in bed; she is singing her young friend to sleep. I will\ncall her presently.""\n\nThis was rather more, however, than even my patience could endure: so I\nwent quietly up the stairs, and pushing the door of the best room\ngently, there I heard a pretty voice, and saw a very pretty sight. In a\nlittle bed which seemed almost to shine with cleanliness, there lay a\nyoung girl fast asleep, but lying in such a way that none who had ever\nseen could doubt of her. That is to say, with one knee up, and the foot\nof the other leg thrown back, and showing through the bed-clothes, as if\nshe were running a race in sleep. And yet with the back laid flat, and\nsinking into the pillow deeply; while a pair of little restless arms\ncame out and strayed on the coverlet. Her full and lively red lips were\nparted, as if she wanted to have a snore, also her little nose well up,\nand the rounding of the tender cheeks untrimmed to the maiden oval. Down\nupon these dark lashes hung, fluttering with the pulse of sleep; while\nheavy clusters of curly hair, dishevelled upon the pillow, framed the\ngentle curve of the forehead and smiling daintiness of the whole.\n\nNear this delicate creature sate, in a bending attitude of protection, a\nstrong and well-made girl, with black hair, jet-black eyes, and a rosy\ncolour spread upon a round plump face. She was smiling as she watched\nthe effect of an old Welsh air which she had been singing--""Ar hyd y\nnos."" To look at her size and figure, you would say that her age was\nfourteen at least; but I knew that she was but twelve years old, as she\nhappened to be our Bunny.\n\nYou may suppose that this child was amazed to see her old Granny again\nonce more, and hardly able to recognise him, except by his voice, and\neyes, and manner, and a sort of way about him such as only relations\nhave. For really, if I must tell the truth, the great roundness of the\nworld had taken such a strong effect upon me, that I had not been able\nto manage one straight line towards Newton Nottage for something over\nsix years now. Perhaps I have said that the Admiralty did not encourage\nour correspondence; and most of us were very well content to allow our\ndear friends to think of us. So that by my pay alone could my native\nparish argue whether I were alive or dead.\n\nIt would not become me to enter into the public rejoicing upon the\nmorrow, after my well-accustomed face was proved to be genuine at the\n""Jolly."" There are moments that pass our very clearest perception, and\njudgment, and even our strength to go through them again. And it was too\nearly yet--except for a man from low latitudes--to call for\nrum-and-water. The whole of this I let them know, while capable of\nreceiving it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nTRIPLE EDUCATION.\n\n\nMaster Roger Berkrolles had proved himself a schoolmaster of the very\ndriest honesty. This expression, upon afterthought, I beg to use\nexpressly. My own honesty is of a truly unusual and choice character;\nand I have not found, say a dozen men, fit anyhow to approach it. But\nthere is always a sense of humour, and a view of honour, wagging in\namong my principles to such an extent that they never get dry, as the\nmultiplication-table does. Master Berkrolles was a man of too much mind\nfor joking.\n\nTherefore, upon the very first morning after my return, and even before\nour breakfast-time, he poured me out such a lot of coin as I never did\nhope to see, himself regarding them as no more than so many shells of\nthe sea to count. All these he had saved from my pay in a manner wholly\nbeyond my imagination, because, though I love to make money of people, I\nsoon let them make it of me again. And this was my instinct now; but\nRoger laid his thin hand on the heap most gravely, and through his\nspectacles watched me softly, so that I could not be wroth with him.\n\n""Friend Llewellyn, I crave your pardon. All this money is lawfully\nyours; neither have I, or anybody, the right to meddle with it. But I\nbeg you to consider what occasions may arise for some of these coins\nhereafter. Also, if it should please the Lord to call me away while you\nare at sea, what might become of the dear child Bunny, without this\nmammon to procure her friends? Would you have her, like poor Andalusia,\ndependent upon charity?""\n\n""Hush!"" I whispered; too late, however, for there stood Bardie herself,\na slim, light-footed, and graceful child, about ten years old just then,\nI think. Her dress of slate-coloured stuff was the very plainest of the\nplain, and made by hands more familiar with the needle than the\nscissors. No ornament, or even change of colour, was she decked with,\nnot so much as a white crimped frill for the fringes of hair to dance\nupon. No child that came to the well (so long as she possessed a mother)\never happened to be dressed in this denying manner. But two girls\nblessed with good stepmothers, having children of their own, were\nindued, as was known already, with dresses cut from the self-same\nremnant. Now, as she looked at Roger Berkrolles with a steadfast wonder,\nnot appearing for the moment to remember me at all, a deep spring of\nindefinite sadness filled her dark grey eyes with tears.\n\n""Charity!"" she said at last: ""if you please, sir, what is charity?""\n\n""Charity, my dear, is kindness; the natural kindness of good people.""\n\n""Is it what begins at home, sir; as they say in the copy books?""\n\n""Yes, my dear; but it never stops there. It is a most beautiful thing.\nIt does good to everybody. You heard me say, my dear child, that you are\ndependent on charity. It is through no fault of your own, remember; but\nby the will of God. You need not be ashamed to depend on the kindness of\ngood people.""\n\nHer eyes shone, for a moment, with bright gratitude towards him for\nreconciling her with her pride; and then being shy at my presence\nperhaps, she turned away, just as she used to do, and said to herself\nvery softly--""I would rather have a home though--I would rather have a\nhome, and a father and mother of my own, instead of beautiful charity.""\n\nMaster Berkrolles told me, when she was gone, that many children of the\nplace had no better manners than to be always shouting after her, when\ncoming back from the sandhills, ""Where\'s your father? Where\'s your\nmother? Where\'s your home, Delushy?""\n\nThis, of course, was grievous to her, and should never have been done;\nand I let Roger know that his business was to stop any scandal of this\nkind. But he declared that really the whole of his mind was taken up,\nand much of his body also, in maintaining rule and reason through the\nproper hours. After school-time it was not the place of the\nschoolmaster, but of the parson of the parish, or by deputy\nchurchwardens, or failing them the clerk, and (if he were out of the\nway) the sexton, to impress a certain tone of duty on the young ones.\nEspecially the sexton need not even call his wife to help, if he would\nbut have the wit to cultivate more young thoughtfulness, by digging a\ngrave every other day, and trusting the Lord for orders.\n\nIt was not long before Delushy learned some memory of me, partly with\nthe aid of Bunny, partly through the ship I made--such as no other\nman could turn out--partly through my uniform, and the rest of it by\nmeans of goodness only can tell what. A man who is knocked about, all\nover rounds, and flats, and sides of mountains, also kicked into and out\nof every hole and corner, and the strong and weak places of the earth,\nand upset after all the most by his fellow-creatures\' doings, although\nhe may have started with more principle than was good for him, comes\nhome, in the end, to look at results far more than causes.\n\nThis was exactly mine own case. I can hardly state it more clearly. I\nwanted no praise from anybody; because I felt it due to me. A fellow who\ndoubts about himself may value approbation; and such was the case with\nme, perhaps, while misunderstood by the magistrates. But now all the\nmoney which I had saved, under stewardship of Berkrolles, enabled all my\nhousehold to stand up and challenge calumny.\n\nThere is a depth of tender feeling in the hearts of Welshmen, such as\ncannot anywhere else be discovered by a Welshman. Heartily we love to\nfind man or woman of our own kin (even at the utmost nip of the calipers\nof pedigree) doing anything which reflects a spark of glory on us. Of\nthis man, or woman even, we make all the very utmost, to the extremest\npoint where truth assuages patriotism. The whole of our neighbourhood\ntook this matter from a proper point of view, and sent me such an\ninvitation to a public dinner, that I was obliged to show them all the\ncorners of the road, when the stupid fellows thought it safer to conduct\nme home again.\n\nUpon that festive occasion, also, Sandy Macraw took a great deal too\nmuch, so entirely in honour of me that I felt the deepest goodwill\ntowards him before the evening was over, even going so far, it appears,\nas to discharge him from all backrent for the use of my little frigate.\nI certainly could not remember such an excess of generosity, upon the\nfollowing morning; until he pulled off his hat and showed me the\nfollowing document inscribed with a pencil on the lining: ""Dearest and\nbest of friends,--After the glorious tribute paid by the generous\nScotchman to the humble but warm-hearted Cambrian, the latter would be\nbelow contempt if he took a penny from him. Signed DAVID LLEWELLYN;\nwitness Rees Hopkins, chairman, his mark.""\n\nAfter this, and the public manner of my execution, there was nothing to\nbe said, except that Sandy Macraw was below contempt for turning to\ninferior use the flow of our finest feelings. Therefore I went, with\nsome indignation, to resume possession of my poor boat, which might as\nwell have been Sandy\'s own, during the last five years and more.\nHowever, I could not deny that the Scotchman had kept his part of the\ncontract well, for my boat was beautifully clean and in excellent\nrepair; in a word, as good as new almost. So I put Miss Delushy on board\nof her, with Bunny for the lady\'s-maid, and finding a strong ebb under\nus, I paddled away towards Sker and landed bravely at Pool Tavan.\n\nFor poor Black Evan lay now in our churchyard by the side of his live\nbold sons, having beheld the white horse as plainly as any of the\nCoroner\'s jury. The reason was clear enough to all who know anything of\nmedicine, to wit, his unwise and pernicious step in prostituting his\nconstitution to the use of water.\n\nIf any unfortunate man is harassed with such want of self-respect, and\nutter distrust of Providence, as well as unpleasancy of behaviour\ntowards all worthy neighbours, and black ingratitude to his life, as to\nmake a vow for ever never to drink any good stuff again, that man must\nbe pitied largely; but let no one speak harshly of him; because he must\nso soon be dead. And this in half the needful time, if formerly he went\non too much.\n\nPoor Moxy now, with young Watkin only, carried on this desert farm. It\nwas said that no farmer, ever since the Abbots were turned out, could\ncontrive to get on at Sker. One after the other failed to get a return\nfor the money sunk into the desolate sandy soil. Black Evan\'s father\ntook the place with a quarter of a bushel heaped with golden guineas of\nQueen Anne. And very bravely he began, but nothing ever came of it,\nexcept that he hanged himself at last, and left his son to go on with\nit. What chance was there now for Moxy, with no money, and one son only,\nand a far better heart than head?\n\nNevertheless she would not hear for one moment of such a thing as giving\nup Delushy. This little maid had a way of her own of winding herself\ninto people\'s hearts, given to her by the Lord Himself, to make up for\nhard dealings. Moxy loved her almost as much as her own son Watkin, and\nwas brought with the greatest trouble to consent to lose her often, for\nthe sake of learning. Because there never could be at Sker the smallest\nchance of growing strongly into education. And everybody felt that\nBardie was of a birth and nature such as demanded this thing highly.\n\nHowever, even this public sentiment might have ended in talk alone, if\nLady Bluett had not borne in mind her solemn pledge to me. Roger\nBerkrolles would have done his best, of course, to see to it; but his\nauthority in the parish hung for a while upon female tongues, which\nforced him to be most cautious. So that I, though seven years absent, am\nbeyond doubt entitled to the credit of this child\'s scholarship. I had\nseen the very beginning of it, as I must have said long ago, but what\nwas that compared with all that happened in my absence? Berkrolles was a\nmighty scholar (knowing every book almost that ever in reason ought to\nhave been indited or indicted), and his calm opinion was, that ""he never\nhad led into letters such a mind as Bardie\'s!""\n\nShe learned more in a week almost, than all the rising generation sucked\nin for the quarter. Not a bit of milching knowledge could he gently\noffer her, ere she dragged the whole of it out of his crop, like a young\npigeon feeding. And sometimes she would put such questions that he could\ndo nothing more than cover both his eyes up!\n\nAll such things are well enough for people who forget how much the body\ndoes outweigh the mind, being meant, of course, to do so, getting more\nfood, as it does, and able to enjoy it more, by reason of less\ndaintiness. But for my part, I have always found it human prudence to\nprevent the mind, or soul, or other parts invisible, from conspiracy to\noutgo, what I can see, and feel, and manage, and be punished for not\nheeding--that is to say, my body.\n\nNow the plan arranged for Bardie was the most perfect that could be\nimagined, springing from the will of Providence, and therefore far\nsuperior to any human invention. Master Berkrolles told me that a human\nbeing may be supposed to consist principally of three parts--the body,\nwhich is chiefly water (this I could not bear to hear of, unless it were\nsalt water, which he said might be the case with me); the mind, which\nmay be formed of air, if it is formed of anything; and the soul, which\nis strong spirit, and for that reason keeps the longest.\n\nAccordingly this homeless maiden\'s time was so divided, that her three\nparts were provided for, one after other, most beautifully. She made her\nrounds, with her little bag, from Sker to Candleston Court, and thence\nto Master Berkrolles at my cottage, and back again to Sker, when Moxy\ncould not do without her. She would spend, perhaps, a fortnight at\nCandleston, then a fortnight in Newton village, and after that a month\nat Sker, more or less, as might be, according to the weather and the\nchances of conveyance.\n\nAt Candleston, of course, she got the best of bodily food as well; but\nLady Bluett made a point of attending especially to her soul, not in a\nsanctimonious way, but concerning grace, and manners, and the love of\nmusic, and the handling of a knife and fork, and all the thousand little\nthings depending on that part of us. And here she was made a most\nperfect pet, and wore very beautiful clothes, and so on; but left them\nall behind, and went as plain as a nun to Newton, as soon as the time\narrived for giving her mind its proper training.\n\nNow when her mind was ready to burst with the piles of learning stored\nin it, and she could not sleep at night without being hushed by means of\nsinging, Moxy would come from Sker to fetch her, and scold both the\nMaster and Bunny well, for the paleness of Delushy\'s face, and end by\nbegging their pardon and bearing the child away triumphantly, with\nWatkin to carry the bag for her.\n\nAnd then for a month there was play, and sea-air, and rocks to climb\nover, and sandhills, and rabbits and wild-fowl to watch by the hour, and\nbathing throughout the summer-time, and nothing but very plain food at\nregular intervals of fine appetite.\n\nSo the over-active mind sank back to its due repose, and the tender\ncheeks recovered, with kind Nature\'s nursing, all the bloom the flowers\nhave, because they think of nothing. Also the lightsome feet returned,\nand the native grace of movement, and the enjoyment of good runs, and\nlaughter unrepressed but made harmonious by discipline. And then the\nhair came into gloss, and the eyes to depths of brightness, and all the\nmysteries of wisdom soon were tickled out of her.\n\nThis was the life she had been leading, now for some six years or more;\nand being of a happy nature, she was quite contented. In the boat I did\nmy utmost, that day, to examine her as to all her recollections of her\nearly history. But she seemed to dwell upon nothing now, except the most\ntrifling incidents, such as a crab lifting up the cover one day when Old\nDavy was boiling him, or ""Dutch"" being found with a lot of small\nDutches, and nobody knew where they came from. She had no recollection\nof any boat, or even a Coroner\'s inquest; and as to papa, and mama, and\nbrother--she put her hand up to her beautiful forehead, to think, and\nthen wondered about them.\n\nHaving cleverly brought you thus to a proper acquaintance with the\npresent situation, I really think that you must excuse me from going\ninto all Moxy\'s transports, called forth by the sight of me.\n\nIn spite of all that, I always say in depreciation of myself (ay, and\noften mean it too), nobody can have failed to gather that my countrymen\nat large, and (which matters more) my countrywomen, take a most kind\nview of me. And it would have been hard indeed if Moxy could not find a\ntear or two. And Watkin now was a fine young fellow, turned of twenty\nsome time ago, straight as an arrow, and swift as a bird, but shy as a\ntrout in a mountain-stream. From a humble distance he admired Miss\nDelushy profoundly, and was ever at her beck and call; so that of course\nshe liked him much, but entertained a feminine contempt for such a\nfellow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nGREAT MARCH OF INTELLECT.\n\n\nNow I come to larger actions, and the rise of great events, and the\nmovements of mankind, enough to make their mother earth tremble, and\ntake them for suicides, and even grudge her bosom for their naked\nburial. Often had I longed for war, not from love of slaughter, but\nbecause it is so good for us. It calls out the strength of a man from\nhis heart, into the swing of his legs and arms, and fills him with his\nduty to the land that is his mother; and scatters far away small things,\nand shows beyond dispute God\'s wisdom, when He made us male and female.\n\nThe fair sex (after long peace) always want to take the lead of us,\nhaving rash faith in their quicker vigour of words and temper. But they\nprove their goodness always, coming down to their work at once, when the\nblood flows, and the bones are split into small splinters, and a man\ndies bravely in their arms, through doing his duty to them.\n\nBut though war is good, no doubt (till men shall be too good for it),\nthere was not one man as yet in Great Britain, who would have gone of\nhis own accord into the grand and endless war at this time impending.\nMaster Roger Berkrolles told me that throughout all history (every in\nand out of which he knew, while pretending otherwise) never had been\nknown such war, and destruction of God\'s men, as might now be looked\nfor. He said that it was no question now of nation against nation, such\nas may be fought out and done with, after rapid victory; neither a piece\nof mere covetousness for a small advance of dominion; nor even a contest\nof dynasties, which might prove the tougher one. But that it was\nuniversal clash; half of mankind imbittered to a deadly pitch with the\nother half; and that now no peace could be, till one side was crushed\nunder.\n\nThese things were beyond my grasp of widest comprehension, neither could\nI desire a war, begun about nothing, anyhow. If the Frenchmen insulted\nour flag, or wanted back some of their islands, or kept us from\nexamining their customs (when imported), no true Briton could hesitate\nto keep his priming ready.\n\nBut at present they were only plucking up courage to affront us, being\nengrossed with their own looseness, and broad spread of idiocy. For they\neven went the length of declaring all men to be equal, the whole world\ncommon property, and the very names of the months all wrong! After this\nit was natural, and one might say the only sensible thing they ever did,\nto deny the existence of their Maker. For it could hardly be argued that\nthe Almighty ever did lay hand to such a lot of scoundrels.\n\nNow if these rats of the bilge-hole had chosen to cock their tails in\ntheir dirt, and devour one another, pleasure alone need have been the\nfeeling of the human race looking down at them. But the worst of it was\nthat real men, and women, far above them, took up their filthy tricks\nand antics, and their little buck-jumps, and allowed their judgment so\nto be taken with grimaces--even as a man who mocks a fit may fall into\nit--that in every country there were ""sympathisers with the great and\nglorious march of intellect.""\n\nIn Devonshire, I had heard none of all this, for none of the servants\never set eyes, or desired to do so, on ""public journals."" They had heard\nof these, but believed them to be very dangerous and wicked things; also\ndevoid of interest, for what was the good of knowing things which\nanybody else might know?[E]\n\nAnd even if they had taken trouble ever to hear of the great outbreak,\nthey would have replied (until it led to recruiting in their own\nparish), ""Thiccy be no consarn to we.""\n\nBut in our enlightened neighbourhood things were very different. There\nhad long been down among us ever so many large-minded fellows, anxious\nto advance mankind, by great jumps, towards perfection. And in this they\nshowed their wisdom (being all young bachelors) to strive to catch the\ngolden age before they got rheumatics.\n\nHowever, to men whose life has been touched with the proper grey and\nbrown of earth, all these bright ideas seemed a baseless dance of\nrainbows. Man\'s perfection was a thing we had not found in this world;\nand being by divine wisdom weaned from human pride concerning it, we\ncould be well content to wait our inevitable opportunity for seeking it\nin the other world. We had found this world wag slowly; sometimes\nbetter, and sometimes worse, pretty much according to the way in which\nit treated us. Neither had we yet perceived, in the generation newly\nbreeched, any grand advance, but rather a very poor backsliding, from\nwhat we were at their time of life. We all like a strong fellow when we\nsee him; and we all like a very bright child, who leaps through our\nmisty sense of childhood. To either of these an average chap knocks\nunder, when quite sure of it. And yet, in our parish, there was but one\nof the one sort, and one of the other. Bardie, of course, of the new\ngeneration; and old Davy of the elder. It vexes me to tell the truth so.\nBut how can I help it, unless I spoil my story?\n\nEver so many people got a meeting in the chapel up, to sign a paper, and\nto say that nobody could guess the mischief done by all except\nthemselves. They scouted the French Revolution as the direct work of the\ndevil; and in the very next sentence vowed it the work of the seventh\nangel, to shatter the Church of England. They came with this rubbish for\nme to sign; and I signed it (and some of them also) with my\nwell-attested toe and heel.\n\nAfter such a demonstration, any man of candid mind falls back on\nhimself, to judge if he may have been too forcible. But I could not see\nmy way to any cross-road of repentance; and when I found what good I had\ndone, I wished that I had kicked harder. By doing so, I might have\nquenched a pestilential doctrine; as every orthodox person told me, when\nthey heard how the fellows ran. But--as my bad luck always conquers--I\nhad but a pair of worn-out pumps on, and the only toe which a man can\ntrust (through his own defects of discipline) happened to be in hospital\nnow, and short of spring and flavour. Nevertheless some good was done.\nFor Parson Lougher not only praised me, but in his generous manner\nprovided a new pair of shoes for me, to kick harder, if again so\nvisited. And the news of these prevented them.\n\nBut even the way these fellows had to rub themselves was not enough to\nstop the spreading of low opinions; for the strength of my manifestation\nwas impressive rather than permanent. Also all the lower lot of\nNonconformists and schismatics ran with their tongues out, like mad\ndogs, all over the country raving, snapping at every good gentleman\'s\nheels, and yelping that the seventh vial was open, and the seventh seal\nbroken. To argue with a gale of wind would show more sense than to try\ndiscussion with such a set of ninnies; and when I asked them to\nreconcile their admiration of atheism with their religious fervour, one\nof them answered bravely that he would rather worship the Goddess of\nReason than the God of the Church of England.\n\nHowever, the followers of John Wesley, and all the respectable\nMethodists, scouted these ribalds as much as we did; and even Hezekiah\nhad the sense to find himself going too far with them, and to repair the\nseventh seal, and clap it on Hepzibah\'s mouth. For how could he sell a\nclock, if time was declared by the trumpet to be no more?\n\nAmid this universal turmoil, uproar, and upheaving, I received a letter\nfrom Captain Bampfylde, very short, and without a word of thanks for\nwhat I had done for him, but saying that he was just appointed to the\nBellona, 74, carrying 6 carronades on the poop; that she was fitting now\nat Chatham, and in two months\' time would be at Spithead, where he was\nto man her. He believed that the greater part of the fine ship\'s company\nof the Thetis would be only too glad to sail under him, and he was\nenabled to offer me the master\'s berth, if I saw fit. He said that he\nknew my efficiency, but would not have ventured to take this step but\nfor what I had told him about my thorough acquirement of navigation\nunder the care of a learned man. After saying that if I reported myself\nat Narnton Court by the end of October he would have me cared for and\nsent on, he concluded with these stirring words:--\n\n""There is a great war near at hand; our country will want every man,\nyoung or old, who can fight a gun.""\n\nThese last words fixed my resolve. I had not been very well treated,\nperhaps; at any rate, my abilities had not been recognised too highly,\nlest they should have to be paid for with a little handsomeness. But a\nman of large mind allows for this, feeling that the world, of course,\nwould gladly have him at half-price. But when it came to talking of the\nproper style to fight a gun, how could I give way to any small\nconsiderations?\n\nFuzzy and Ike were stealing rock at this particular period in a new\nketch called the Devil (wholly in honour of Parson Chowne); and through\nthese worthy fellows, and Bang (now the most trustworthy of all), I sent\na letter to Narnton Court, accepting the mastership of his Majesty\'s\nship of the line, Bellona.\n\nNow everybody in earnest began to call me ""Captain Llewellyn""--not at my\nown instigation, but in spite of all done to the contrary. The master of\na ship must be the captain, they argued, obstinately; and my well-known\nmodesty had the blame of all that I urged against it. But I need not say\nany more about it; because the war has gone on so long, and so many\nseamen have now been killed, that the nation has been stirred up to\nlearn almost a little about us.\n\nWhile I was dwelling on all these subjects, who should appear but Miss\nDelushy, newly delivered from Candleston Court, on her round of high\neducation? And to my amazement, who but Lieutenant Bluett delivered her?\nI had not even heard that he was come home; so much does a man, when he\nrises in life, fail in proper wakefulness! But now he leaped down from\nthe forecastle, and with a grave and most excellent courtesy, and his\nbright uniform very rich and noble, and his face outdoing it, forth he\nled this little lady, who was clad in simple grey. She descended quite\nas if it was the proper thing to do; and then she turned and kissed the\ntips of her fingers to him gracefully. And she was not yet eleven years\nold! How can we be amazed at any revolutions after this?\n\n""Bardie!"" I cried, with some indignation, as if she were growing beyond\nmy control; and she stood on the spring of her toes exactly as she had\ndone when two years old, and offered her bright lips for a kiss, to\nprove that she was not arrogant. None but a surly bear could refuse her;\nstill my feelings were deeply hurt, that other people should take\nadvantage of my being from home so much, to wean the affections of this\ndarling from her own old Davy, and perhaps to set up a claim for her.\n\nBerkrolles knew what my rights were; and finding him such a quiet man,\nI gave it to him thoroughly well, before I went to bed that night. I let\nhim know that his staying there depended wholly upon myself; not only as\nhis landlord, but as holding such a position now in Newton, and Nottage,\nand miles around, that the lifting of my finger would leave him without\na scholar or a crust. Also I wished him to know that he must not, as a\nwretched landsman, take any liberties with me, because I had allowed him\ngratis to impart to me the vagueness of what he called ""Mathematics,"" in\nthe question of navigation. Of that queer science I made out some; but\nthe rest went from me, through the clearness of my brain (which let\nthings pass through it); otherwise I would have paid him gladly, if he\nhad earned it. But he said (or I may myself have said, to suggest some\nsense to him) that my brain was now too full of experience for\nexperiments. And of all the knowledge put into me by this good man\ncarefully, and I may say laboriously, I could not call to mind a letter,\nfigure, stroke, or even sign, when I led the British fleet into action,\nat the battle of the Nile. Nevertheless, it may all have been there,\nsteadily underlying all, coming through great moments, like a quiet\nperspiration.\n\nBut if I could not take much learning, here was some one else who could;\nand there could be no finer sight for lovers of education than to watch\nold Mr Berkrolles and his pupil entering into the very pith of\neverything. I could not perceive any cause for excitement, in a dull\nmatter of this sort; nevertheless they seemed to manage to get stirred\nup about it. For when they came to any depth of mystery for fathoming,\nit was beautiful to behold the long white hair and the short brown curls\ndancing together over it. That good old Roger was so clever in every\nstyle of teaching, that he often feigned not to know a thing of the\nsimplest order to him; so that his pupil might work it out, and have a\nbit of triumph over him. He knew that nothing puts such speed into\nlittle folk and their steps--be they of mind or body--as to run a race\nwith grown-up people, whether nurse or tutor.\n\nBut in spite of all these brilliant beams of knowledge now shed over\nher, our poor Bardie was held fast in an awkward cleft of conscience. I\nmay not have fully contrived to show that this little creature was as\nquick of conscience as myself almost; although, of course, in a smaller\nway, and without proper sense of proportions. But there was enough of it\nleft to make her sigh very heavily, lest she might have gone too far in\none way or the other. Her meaning had been, from her earliest years, to\nmarry, or be married. She had promised me through my grey whiskers often\n(with two years to teach her her own mind), never, as long as she lived,\nto accept any one but old Davy. We had settled it ever so many times,\nwhile she sate upon my shoulder; and she smacked me every now and then,\nto prove that she meant matrimony. Now, when I called to her mind all\nthis, she said that I was an old stupid, and she meant to do just what\nshe liked; though admitting that everybody wanted her. And after a\nlittle thought she told me, crossing her legs (in the true old style),\nand laying down her lashes, that her uncertainty lay between Master\nRoger and Mr Bluett. She had promised them both, she did believe,\nwithout proper time to think of it; and could she marry them both,\nbecause the one was so young and the other so old? I laid before her\nthat the proper middle age of matrimony could not be attained in this\nway; though in the present upside-down of the world it might come to be\nthought of. And then she ran away and danced (exactly as she used to\ndo), and came back with her merry laugh to argue the point again with\nme.\n\nBefore I set off for Narnton Court, on my way to join the Bellona,\nLieutenant Bluett engaged my boat and my services, both with oar and\nnet, for a day\'s whole pleasure off shore and on. I asked how many he\nmeant to take, for the craft was a very light one; but he answered, ""As\nmany as ever he chose, for he hoped that two officers of the Royal Navy\nknew better than to swamp a boat in a dead calm such as this was."" My\nself-respect derived such comfort from his outspoken and gallant way of\ncalling me a brother officer (as well as from the most delicate air of\nignorance which he displayed when I took up a two-guinea piece which\nhappened to have come through my roof at this moment perhaps, or at any\nrate somehow to be lying in an old tobacco-box on my table), that I\ndeclared my boat and self at his command entirely.\n\nWe had a very pleasant party, and not so many as to endanger us, if the\nladies showed good sense. Colonel Lougher and Lady Bluett, also the\nlieutenant, of course, and a young lady staying at Candleston Court, and\ndoing her utmost to entrap the youthful sailor--her name has quite\nescaped me--also Delushy, and myself. These were all, or would have been\nall, if Master Rodney had not chanced, as we marched away from my\ncottage, with two men carrying hampers, to espy, in the corner of the\nold well, a face so sad, and eyes so black, that they pierced his happy\nand genial heart.\n\n""I\'ll give it to you, you sly minx,"" I cried, ""for an impudent, brazen\ntrick like this. What orders did I give you, Miss? A master of a ship of\nthe line, and not master of his own grandchild!""\n\nThe young lieutenant laughed so that the rushes on the sandhills shook,\nfor he saw in a moment all the meaning of this most outrageous trick.\nBunny, forgetting her grade in life, had been crying, ever since she\nawoke, at receiving no invitation to this great festivity. She had even\nshown ill-will and jealousy towards Bardie, and a want of proper\nsubmission to her inevitable rank in the world. I perceived that these\nvile emotions grew entirely from the demagogic spirit of the period,\nwhich must be taken in hand at once. Wherefore I boxed her ears with\nvigour, and locked her into an empty cupboard, there to wait for our\nreturn, with a junk of bread and a cheese-rind. However, she made her\nway out, as her father had done with the prison of Dunkirk; and here she\nwas in spite of all manners, good faith, and discipline.\n\n""Let her come; she deserves to come; she shall come,"" Master Rodney\ncried; and as all the others said the same, I was forced to give in to\nit; and upon the whole I was proud perhaps of our Bunny\'s resolution.\nNeither did it turn out ill, but rather a good luck for us, because the\nyoung lady who wooed the lieutenant proved her entire unfitness for a\nmaritime alliance, by wanting, before we had long been afloat, although\nthe sea was as smooth as a duck-pond, some one to attend upon her.\n\nEvery one knows what the Tuskar Rock is, and the caves under Southern\nDown; neither am I at all of a nature to dwell upon eating and drinking.\nAnd though all these were of lofty order, and I made a fire of\nwreck-wood (just to broil some collops of a sewin, who came from the\nwater into it, through a revival of my old skill; and to do a few\noysters in their shells, with their gravy sputtering, to let us know\nwhen they were done, and to call for a bit of butter), no small\nconsiderations, or most grateful memories of flavour could have\nwhispered to me twice, thus to try my mouth with waterings over such a\ncookery. But I have two reasons for enlarging on this happy day; and\nthese two would be four at once, if any one contradicted them.\n\nMy chief reason is that poor dear Bardie first obtained a pure\nknowledge of her desolate state upon that occasion;--at least so far as\nwe can guess what works inside the little chips of skulls that we call\nbabyish. Everybody had spoiled her so (being taken with her lovingness,\nand real newness of going on, and power to look into things, together\nwith such a turn for play as never can be satiated in a world like ours;\nnot to mention heaps of things which you must see to understand), let me\nnot overdo it now, in saying that this little dear had taken such good\neducation, through my liberal management, as to long to know a little\nmore about herself, if possible.\n\nThis is a very legitimate wish, and deserving of more encouragement than\nmost of us care to give to it; because so many of us are not the waifs\nand strays, and salvage only, but the dead shipwrecks of ourselves;\ncontent with the bottom of the great deep, only if no shallow fellows\nshall come diving down for us.\n\nHaving the joy of sun and sea, and the gratitude for a most lovely\ndinner, such as none could take from me, I happened to lie on my oars\nand think, while all my passengers roved on the rock. They were astray\nupon bladder-weed, pop-weed, dellusk, oar-weed, ribbons, frills, kelp,\nwrack, or five-tails--anything you like to call them, without falling\nover them. My orders were to stand off and on, till the gentry had\namused themselves. Only I must look alive; for the Tuskar rock would be\ntwo fathoms under water, in about four hours, at a mile and a half from\nthe nearest land.\n\nThe sunset wanted not so much as a glance of sea to answer it, but lay\nhovering quietly, and fading beneath the dark brows of the cliffs; which\ndo sometimes glorify, and sometimes so discourage it. The meaning of the\nweather and the arrangement of the sky and sea, was not to make a show\nfor once, but to let the sunset gently glide into the twilight, and the\ntwilight take its time for melting into starlight. This I never thus\nhave watched except in our old island.\n\nThere was not a wave to be seen or felt, only the glassy heave of the\ntide lifted my boat every now and then, or lapped among the wrinkles of\nthe rocks, and spread their fringes. Not a sound was in the air, and on\nthe water nothing, except the little tinkling softness of the drops that\nfeathered off from my suspended oar-blades.\n\nFloating round a corner thus, I came upon a sight as gently sad as sky\nand sea were. A little maid was leaning on a shelf of stone with her\nhair dishevelled as the kelp it mingled with. Her plain brown hat was\ncast aside, and her clasped hands hid her face, while her slender feet\nhung down, and scarcely cared to paddle in the water that embraced them.\nNow and then a quiet sob, in harmony with the evening tide, showed that\nthe storm of grief was over, but the calm of deep sorrow abiding.\n\n""What is the matter, my pretty dear?"" I asked, after landing, and\ncoaxing her. ""Tell old Davy; Captain David will see the whole of it put\nto rights.""\n\n""It cannot be put to yights,"" she answered, being even now unable to\npronounce the _r_ aright, although it was rather a lisp than any clear\nsound that supplied its place; ""it never can be put to yights: when the\nother children had fathers and mothers, God left me outside of them; and\nthe young lady says that I must not aspiya ever to marry a gentleman. I\nam ony fit for Watkin, or Tommy-Toms, or nobody! Old Dyo, why did I\nnever have a father or a mother?""\n\n""My dear, you had plenty of both,"" I replied; ""but they were\nshipwrecked, and so were you. Only before the storm came on, you were\nput into this boat somehow, nobody living can tell how, and the boat\ncame safe, though the ship was wrecked.""\n\n""This boat!"" she cried, spreading out her hands to touch it upon either\nside--for by this time I had shipped her--""was it this boat saved me?""\n\n""Yes, you beauty of the world. Now tell me what that wicked girl had the\nimpudence to say to you.""\n\nThis I need not here set down. Enough that it flowed from jealousy,\njealousy of the lowest order, caused by the way in which Lieutenant\nRodney played with Bardie. This of course interfered with the lady\'s\nchances of spreading nets for him, so that soon she lost her temper,\nfell upon Delushy, and upbraided her for being no more than an utterly\nunknown castaway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nBEATING UP FOR THE NAVY.\n\n\nMy other reason for setting down some short account of that evening was\nto give you a little peace, and sense of gratitude to the Lord, for our\nmany quiet sunsets, and the tranquillity of our shores. It really seems\nas if no other land was blest as ours is, with quiet orderly folk inside\nit, and good rulers over it, and around it not too much of sun or moon,\nor anything, unless it may be, now and then, a little bit of cloudiness.\nAnd this love of our country seems ever to be strongest, whether at\ndeparting for the wars with turbulent nations, or upon returning home,\nas soon as we have conquered them. But now for a long time, I shall have\nvery little peace to dwell upon.\n\nAt Narnton Court I found no solace for my warmth of feeling. Polly had\nbeen sent out of the way, on purpose, because I was coming; which was a\nmost unhandsome thing on the part of Mrs Cockhanterbury. For the very\nexpectation which had buoyed me up at a flattish period, and induced me\nto do without three quids of cross-cut negrohead, was my simple and\nhumble looking forward to my Polly. I knew that I was a fool, of course;\nbut still I could not help it; and I had got on so well among young\nwomen always, that I found it very hard to miss the only chance I cared\nfor. I feared that my age was beginning to tell; for often, since I had\nbeen ashore, my rheumatics had come back again. Neither was that my only\ngrief and source of trouble at this time; but many other matters quite\nas grave combined against me. Heaviside was not there to talk, and make\nme hug my singleness; nor even Jerry Toms, nor the cook, who used to let\nme teach her. It was not that all these had left the place for any\nmischief. In an ancient household such a loss is not allowable. All\nmeant to come back again, when it suited their opportunities, and each\nperceived that the house was sure to go to the dogs in the absence of\nthemselves and one another. Heaviside had found Nanette (in spite of my\nbest prognostics) overget her seventh occasion of producing small\nCrappos, and his natural disappointment with her led to such words that\nhe shouldered his bundle and made off for Spithead, in company with\nJerry, who was compelled to forsake his creditors. And as for the cook,\nI did hear, though unable to believe it, that she was in trouble about a\nyoung fellow scarcely worthy to turn her jack.\n\nIn other respects I found that nothing of much importance had occurred\nsince I was there in the summer-time. Sir Philip continued to trust in\nthe Lord, and the Squire to watch the sunsets; neither had the latter\nbeen persuaded to absolve his brother. The Captain had been at home one\nor two days, inquiring into my discovery of the buried dolls. He did\nnot attach so much importance to this matter as his father had done, but\nsaid that it made a mysterious question even more mysterious. And\nfailing, as a blunt sailor would, to make either head or tail of it, and\nbeing disgusted with his brother for refusing to see him, he vowed to\nremain in the house no longer, but set off for Pomeroy Castle again,\nwhere he had formed a close friendship with the eldest son of the owner.\nHis lady-love, the fair Isabel, was not living there now, but might very\neasily be met with; for on coming of age three years ago, she had taken\npossession of her domain, ""Carey Park,"" a magnificent place adjoining\nthe Pomeroy property. It was said that the Earl had done his best to\ncatch the young heiress for his son, and therefore had made a pretext of\nthe old charge against the Captain, for the purpose of putting a stop to\ncommunication with him. But his son, Lord Mohun, upon finding how the\nyoung lady\'s heart was settled, withdrew his suit (like a man of\nhonour), and all the more promptly, perhaps, because he had made up his\nmind to another lady before Miss Carey came to them.\n\nIt was said that the Captain might now have persuaded the beautiful\nheiress to marry him, and finish their long affection, if he could have\nthoroughly made up his mind that honour would bear him out in it. For\nher confidence was so perfect in him, that she left it to his own\njudgment, herself perhaps longing to put an end to their wearisome\nuncertainty. Sir Philip heard of it, and came down, to implore them thus\nto settle themselves. And Captain Bampfylde was so hard set by the\nnature of the case, that he might have been enticed away from what his\nconscience told him. This was that the solemn oath which he had taken in\nthe church, with Isabel beside him, to purge himself of all foul charges\n(ere he made another guilty, if himself were guilty), could not thus be\nlaid aside without a loss of honour. Sir Philip would be the last man in\nthe world to counsel dishonest actions; but being an old man, and\nreluctant that his race should all expire, he looked upon that sacrament\nas no more than a piece of sacrilege, or a hasty pledge of which the\nLord would never take advantage.\n\nNobody knows what might have happened with Captain Bampfylde so beset,\nand longing to think that he ought to act as everybody told him: but he\nbegged for a night to think over it; and in the morning he received his\nappointment to the Bellona. Even Sir Philip could not deny that the\nhand and the will of the Almighty must herein be recognised. And there\nwas a chance of a brush with Spain, about the Nootka Sound, just then;\nand if anything makes a sailor\'s fortune, it is a fight with these fine\nold Dons. A Frenchman is sure to be captured, but not half so sure as a\nSpaniard; and the hidalgoes do turn out good gold, with good manners\nbehind it. Many ships have I boarded, but with brightest alacrity always\na good fat old Spaniard.\n\nTherefore the Captain brushed away any little weakness, and set out for\nSpithead bravely, in a bachelor condition. And after trying to collect\nwhat news there was at Narnton, and finding that I must not think of\nmeeting my dear Polly, I quietly drew my travelling-money, and set forth\nto join him.\n\nOnly every one will reproach me, and have right to do so, if I fail to\ntell the latest tidings of that Parson Chowne. People seemed to like\nthis man, because they never could make him out, and nearly all the\nworld is pleased to hear of the rest being vanquished. It seems that a\nwholly new bishop arose, by reason of the other dying, and this\ngentleman swore on the Bible to have things in order. When he heard of\nChowne, and his high defiance of all former bishops, he said, ""Fie, fie!\nthis must not be; I will very soon put this to rights."" To follow up\nthis resolution he appointed Tiverton, and the old church of St Peter,\nfor Chowne to bring his young people up to a noble confirmation; also\nfor a visitation of the clergy all around; such as they have now and\nthen, to stop the spread of king\'s evil.\n\nHis holiness the Bishop was surprised to receive this answer: ""My dear\nLord,--My meet is at Calverly on the day you speak of. We always find a\nfox hard by; and if he should make for Stoodleigh coverts, I may come\ndown the Bolham road in time to meet your Lordship. At any rate, I shall\ndine at \'The Angel,\' somewhere between three and five o\'clock, and hope\nto find you there, and have a pleasant evening with you.--Yours very\ntruly, R. S. CHOWNE.\n\n""_P.S._--If you bring your two Archdeacons, we will have a rubber: but I\nnever go beyond guinea points.""\n\nThe whole of this was written with Cumberland lead, on the back of a\npaper, showing how to treat hounds in distemper; and the Bishop was\ndispleased about it, and declined his society; especially as he had\ninvitation to the good Tidcombe Rectory. And there he was treated so\nhospitably by a very handsome family, that he put up his glass of a\nnoble wine, and saw the sun set through it, and vowed that his Magna\nCharta, or Habeas Corpus, or Writ of Error--I never can remember\nwhich--but at any rate that his royal orders should fall out of his\napron-pocket, if he failed to execute them.\n\nIn this state of mind he received a letter from Parson Chowne himself,\nfull of respect, and most cleverly turned, as well as describing the\nParson\'s grief at being unable to bring to his holiness any one fit to\nlay hands upon. The standard set before them had been (before laying on\nof hands) to say the Lord\'s Prayer backwards; and there was not one of\nthem up to it. This angered the Bishop to such a degree, that he ordered\nout his heavy coach with the six long-tailed black horses, and the\ncoachman with cocked-hat and flowing wig, and four great footmen\nshouldering blunderbusses; himself sate inside with his crosier and\nmitre, and lawn sleeves, and all the rest of it. Now this was just the\nvery thing the refractory Parson expected; therefore he rode round\novernight and bade every farmer in the neighbourhood send all his hands\nwith pickaxes and shovels, by four o\'clock the next morning: also he\ngathered all his own men there, as well as the unclad folk who were\nentirely at his orders. Then he sent for Parson Jack, as being the\nstrongest man about there, and imparted his intention to him, and placed\nhim over the workmen.\n\nEarly in the afternoon the Bishop\'s state-carriage was descried moving\nup the Tiverton highroad, with a noble and imposing aspect. Before he\narrived at the cross-road leading off to Nympton Rectory, his Lordship\nwas surprised to see a great collection of people standing on a hill\nabove the road, and all saluting him with the deepest respect. ""Not so\nbad after all,"" he exclaimed; ""brother Chowne has brought his men into\ngood order, which is the noblest use of the Church. Ah! they don\'t see a\nbishop every day, and they know when a thing is worth looking at, for\ntheir faces are black with astonishment. Holloa, Bob! what\'s that?""\n\n""Up with the glass, your Lordship,"" the coachman shouted back; ""or it\nwill be all over with you. We are in a damned slough, and no mistake.""\n\nAnd so they were. His Lordship had no time to slam the windows up,\nbefore the coach lay wallowing in a bog of nighty blackness. In it\npoured, and filled the coach, and nearly smothered his Lordship, who was\ndragged out at last with the greatest trouble, as black as if he were\ndipped in pitch. For the Parson had done a most shameful thing, and too\nbad for even him to think of. He had taken up his private road, and dug\nout the ground some six feet deep, and then (by means of carts and\nharrows) transferred to it the contents of a quagmire, which lay handy,\nand spread the surface again with road-dirt, so that it looked as sound\nas a rock. Having seen with a telescope from his window the grand\nsuccess of his engineering, he sent down a groom in smart livery, to\npresent his compliments to the traveller who had happened to lose his\nway, and fall into a moor-hole, and was there anything he could do to\nmitigate that misfortune? But the Bishop sputtered out through his\nchattering teeth that he hoped to hear no more of him, and that none but\na Devonshire man was fit to oversee Devonshire parsons. And this made\nthe fifth bishop conquered by Chowne.\n\nTo return to our noble selves--that is to say, to the better people\ndealt with in our history. At the close of this year 1790, to wit, upon\nChristmas-day of that excellent year of grace, no less than three of us\ndined together (of course, with a good many others also) in the\nCaptain\'s cabin of the Bellona, 74-gun ship of the British Navy,\ncarrying also six carronades. These three were, Captain Drake Bampfylde,\nof course, the Honourable Rodney Bluett, now our second lieutenant, and\nthe Master of the ship, whose name was something like ""David Llewellyn.""\nThis latter was now remarkable for the dignity of his appearance and the\ngravity of his deportment; and although he was only ranked after the\nyoungest of the lieutenants, and just before chits of reefers (called by\nsome people ""midshipmen""), and though upon any but festive occasions you\nmight not have spied him at the Captain\'s table, you could scarcely have\nfound any officer more satisfied with his position and more capable of\nmaintaining it.\n\nWe were cruising off the south coast of Ireland, under orders to search\nall ships that might be likely to carry arms; but as a frigate would\nhave done for that service, as well as, or better than, a 74, we knew\nthat our true commission was to shake together and fall into discipline,\nand bring other seamen into the same, if we could get any to join us.\nHaving a light wind and plenty of sea-room, we resolved to enjoy\nourselves that day; and a very delightful party it was, especially after\nI was called on to spin a few of the many true yarns which make me such\na general favourite.\n\nAfter filling our glasses and drinking the health of his Majesty, and of\nthe Navy at large, and especially of our Captain, we began to talk of\nthe state of affairs and the time at which the war might be expected to\ndeclare itself. That it must come to a great war with France, not even a\nfool could doubt, although he might desire to doubt it, ever since the\ndestruction of the Bastile in July 1789. And throughout all the year and\na half since that, a wild and desperate multitude had done nothing but\nabolish all the safeguards of their country, and every restraint upon\nthe vilest rabble. Our wisest plan was to begin at once, before this\ncruel monster should learn the use of its fangs and the strength of its\nspring; but, as usual, Great Britain was too slow to seize the cudgel,\nwhich might haply have saved a million lives. However, we were preparing\nquietly for the inevitable conflict, as even our presence that day in\nthe cabin of the Bellona might indicate.\n\n""Master, we are sadly short of hands,"" said Captain Bampfylde,\naddressing me; ""I shall have a poor report to make, unless we do\nsomething. Do you think that we could get on without you, if I sent you\non a cruise for a week or so?""\n\n""I think you might, sir,"" I answered humbly; ""if it does not come on to\nblow, and if you keep well away from land. I have trained Mr Sebright\nwith so much skill, that you may always rely upon him, except in any\ndifficulty.""\n\nNobly I spoke; and the Captain\'s reply was not very far behind me. ""If\nwe carried 750 men,"" he exclaimed, with generous candour, ""we could not\nhope to have more than one Master David Llewellyn; so diffident, so\ntruthful, so entirely free from jealousy. Gentlemen, is it not so?""\n\nAll the officers assented with a pleasant smile to me, and then to one\nanother, so that I hardly knew what to say, except that I could not\ndeserve it.\n\n""Our tender the Sealark is to meet us in the Cove of Cork on New Year\'s\nDay,"" continued Captain Bampfylde; ""and after shipping all our stores,\nshe will be for a fortnight at my disposal. Now you know as well as I\ndo, that our complement for war-time is 650 men and boys, and that our\npresent strength is more than 200 short of that. War may be declared any\nday almost, and a pretty figure we should cut against a French liner of\n80 guns. Therefore, unless the Sealark should bring us a very large\ndraft, which I do not expect, my resolve is to man and victual her, for\na fortnight\'s cruise, under some one who is a good hand at recruiting.\nWould you like the berth, Master Llewellyn?""\n\n""Sir, I know not anything which I should like better.""\n\nOur Captain perceived that the junior lieutenants looked rather glum at\nbeing so passed over, from Master Rodney downwards; and though he had\nthe perfect right to appoint any officer he pleased, he knew the true\nwisdom of shunning offence, by giving some good reason. Therefore he\nwent on again:--\n\n""There is not one of us, I daresay, who would not enjoy this little\nchange. But I think that Llewellyn is our man, simply for this reason.\nThe part to be beaten up first is the Welsh coast, from St David\'s Head\nto Penarth. I have heard of many good seamen there, and especially at\nLlanelly. I think that none of our officers can speak Welsh, except\nMaster David. Even you, Bluett, though coming from Wales, are not up to\nthe lingo.""\n\nThis settled it in the best-natured manner; and all congratulated me,\nand wished me good speed in getting hold of old salts, if possible, or\nelse fresh young ones. Not to be too long about it, somewhere about\nEpiphany Day in the year 1791, I stretched away for the coast of Wales,\nbeing in command of the Sealark, a rattling cutter of 100 tons, with two\n6-pound bow-chasers, and a score of picked men under me. I have no time\nnow to describe emotions, even of the loftiest order, such as\npatriotism, modesty, generosity, self-abasement, and many others which I\nindulged in, when I cast anchor off Porthcawl, and they thought that I\nmeant to bombard them. I ordered a boat ashore at once, to reassure the\nnatives, when I had given a waft of my flag, and fired a gun to salute\nit. But being now in such a position, and the parish to its utmost\ncorners raving on the subject, ashore I durst not trust myself; because\nwithout rupture of ancient ties, and a low impression left behind, I\ncould not have got aboard sober again. And after that, could I knock\ndown any of my crew for being tipsy? Nevertheless, I had Bardie, and\nBunny, and Mother Jones with her children, and Master Berkrolles, and\nCharles Morgan, and Betsy Matthews, and Moxy Thomas, all brought in a\nboat to visit me, besides a few others who came without leave. They all\nseemed to be very well and happy, and I entertained them beautifully.\n\nThat same afternoon we made a hit enough to encourage anybody. We\nimpressed not only my foe the tailor, but also Hezekiah! That is to say,\nit was not quite what might be called impressment; because, with no war\nraging yet, we could not resort to violence: but we made them both so\nentirely drunk, that we were compelled, for their own sake, to weigh\nanchor while having their bodies on board. I had a stern fellow of noble\nmind to back me up at all hazard, and seeing what a sneak Hezekiah was,\nhe gave him six dozen out of hand, with my official sanction. The\nHorologist to the Royal Family took his allotment worse than almost any\nman I ever saw; however, for old acquaintance\' sake, I would not have\nhim salted. In spite of this, the effect was such that it brought him\nround to the English Church, and cured him of all French doctrine. And\nas he gradually began to lose fat, and to dwell upon gunnery, we found\nhis oiliness most useful to prevent corrosion.\n\nHaving worked this coast to our utmost power, and gathered a good deal\nof human stuff (some useful and some useless), pretty near threescore in\nall, and put upon short rations, we thought that we might as well finish\nour job by slanting across to Devonshire. Because for the most part, you\nthere may find more body but less mind than ours, which is the proper\nstate of things for the substance of our Navy. Therefore we drafted off\nto Cork all our noble Welshmen, and made sail for Devonshire.\n\nNow, before telling what we did, I really must guard against any nasty\nmisconstruction. Whatever had been done to me on the part of Parson\nChowne, was by this time so wholly gone out of my heart, and mind, and\neverything any man can feel with, that nothing was further from my\nintention than to stir at all in that matter again. I knew that in spite\nof all the deference paid me now on every side (and too much for my\ncomfort), Chowne would turn me inside out, ten thousand times worse than\nStew could. This I like to see done, when anything wrong can be found\ninside a man. But a thoroughly honest fellow should stick on his\nhonesty, and refuse it.\n\nSo when Providence, in a dream, laid before me the great mercy, and I\nmight say miracle, of impressing the naked people, and bringing them\nunder our good chaplain, to be trained from the error of their ways and\nlive, I felt a sort of delicacy as to trespassing thus upon Parson\nChowne\'s old freehold.\n\nThese naked folk belonged to him, and though he did not cultivate them\nas another man might have done, it was not difficult to believe that he\nfound fine qualities in them. And to take them from under his very nose,\nmight seem like a narrow vexation. However, times there are when duty\noverrides all delicacy; the Bellona was still short of her number by a\nhundred hands or more: and with this reflection I cast away all further\nhesitation.\n\nWe left the Sealark off Heddon\'s Mouth, a wild and desolate part of the\ncoast, for my object was to pounce unawares on the Parson\'s savage\ncolony. For what we were going to do was not altogether lawful just at\npresent, although it very soon would be. My force consisted of no less\nthan fifteen jolly well-seasoned tars, all thoroughly armed, all up for\na spree, and ready to do any mortal thing at a word or a signal from me.\nIf we could only surprise the wild men, I had no fear as to our retreat,\nbecause the feeling of the country would be strongly in our favour, as\nthe abaters of a nuisance long pronounced unbearable.\n\nFor five or it may have been six leagues we marched across the moors as\nstraight as possible by compass, except when a quagmire or a ridge of\nrugged stone prevented us. We forded several beautiful streams of the\nbrightest crystal water, so full of trout that I longed to have a turn\nat my old calling; and we came in view of Nympton steeple just as the\nsun was setting. I remembered the lie of the land quite well, ever since\nthat night when the fire happened; so I halted my men in a little wood,\nand left them to eat their suppers, while I slung my spy-glass and\nproceeded to reconnoitre the enemy. Lying flat upon the crest of a\nhummocky ridge of moorland, I brought my glass to bear through the\nheather first upon the great Parson\'s house, which stood on a hill to\nthe left of me, and then on the barbarous settlement. The Rectory looked\nas snug and quiet as the house of the very best man could be; with a\ndeal more of comfort than most of these contrive to gather around them.\n\nThe dens of the tribe that objected to raiment were quite out of sight\nfrom his windows; nor were they allowed to present themselves to Mrs\nChowne, unless she had done anything to vex him. Shaping my glass upon\nthese wretches, I saw that they were in high festival. Of course I could\nnot tell the reason, but it turned out afterwards that the Parson\'s\nhounds were off their feed through a sudden attack of distemper, and\ntherefore a cartload of carrion had been taken down to the settlement.\nIt was lucky that I knew it not, for I doubt whether we should have\ndared to invade their burrows at such a period.\n\nHowever, I thought that nothing could be more suitable for our\nenterprise. Of course they would all overgorge themselves, and then\ntheir habit of drinking water, which alone would establish their\nbarbarism, was sure to throw them into deep untroubled sleep till\nsunrise. As soon as one could strike a line from the pointers to the\nPole-star (which is a crooked one, by the by), and as soon as it was\ndark enough for a man to count the Pleiads, I called my men with a long\nlow whistle, and advanced in double file. The savages lay as deeply\nsleeping as if their consciences were perfect, whereas they could have\nhad none at all. We entered their principal cuddy, or shanty, or\nshieling, or wigwam, or what you will (for it was none of these exactly,\nbut a mixture of them all), and to our surprise not one awoke, or was\ncivilised enough to snore. Higgledy-piggledy they lay in troughs scooped\nout of the side of the hill, or made by themselves, of clay and straw\n(called ""cob,"" I believe, in Devonshire), with some rotten thatch above\nthem, and the sides of their den made of brushwood. Some of the elders\nhad sheepskins over them, but the greater part trusted to one another\nfor warmth, and to their hairiness.\n\nAll this we saw by a blue-light which I ordered to be kindled--for at\nfirst it was as dark as pitch--and a stranger or a sadder sight has\nrarely been seen in England. Poor creatures! they were all so cowed by\nthe brilliant light and the armed men standing in their filthy hovel,\nthat they offered no resistance, but stared at us in a piteous manner,\nas if we were come to kill them. Escape was impossible, save for the\nchildren, and most of them thought (as we found out afterwards) that\nChowne was tired of them and had ordered their destruction.\n\n""Choose all the males from ten years to thirty,"" I shouted to my men,\nwho were almost as scared as the savages: ""don\'t touch the females, or\nI\'ll cut you down. Set another blue-light burning: we don\'t want any\ncripples.""\n\nNot to be too long with it, I only found three men worth impressing; the\nothers were so badly built, or even actually deformed, and of appearance\nso repulsive that we could not bear to think of turning them into\nmessmates.\n\n""Now for the boys!"" I cried; ""we want boys even more then men almost;""\nbut I found that all the children save one had slipped through the\nsailors\' legs adroitly while we were dealing with the men. We could not\nhave caught them in the dark; and more than this, the best-sized of them\nhad popped, like snakes, into burrow-holes, or like a fox into his\nearth.\n\nBut the one who stood his ground, and faced us, was a noble-looking boy,\nin spite of dirt and nakedness, with long thick tangles of golden hair,\nand a forehead like a man\'s almost. He looked up at me in a bold steady\nmanner, wholly unlike their savage stare, and it struck me that here was\nthe little fellow whom I had saved eight or nine years ago from the\nhorse of Parson Jack. But though he appeared to be twelve years old, I\ncould not make out what he said, except ""Yes, yes;"" and ""me come with\noo."" Such was his state of education!\n\nI hoisted him on a strong man\'s back, for the long march had made me\nfeel my years, and perceiving no call to molest the residue, or injure\ntheir home--such as it was--we simply handcuffed the three best fellows,\nand borrowed three pig-whips of their own (made right down ingeniously)\nso as to drive them to Heddon\'s Mouth. We durst not halt for a rest\nuntil there were three leagues between us and Nympton Moor; then\nhurrying on at the break of day, we found the Sealark at anchor; and she\nsent us a boat, at our signal.\n\nScarcely were we on board of the boat, and pushing off with our capture,\nwhen the clash of a horse\'s hoofs upon rock rang through the murmuring\nof the waves. We turned and gazed with one accord, for the boat lay\nbroadside on to shore, through the kicking of the naked men when they\nfelt salt water under them, and our quitting good stroke to attend to\nthem. At furious speed a horseman dashed out of the craggy glen, and\nleaped the pool where the brook is barred up and vanishes. Down the\nshingle, and shelves of wrack, he drove his horse into the sea, until\nthere was no firmness under him. He almost laid hold of our boat--not\nquite; for I struck with an oar at the horse, and scared him, shouting\nto all of my crew to pull.\n\nFinding himself just a little too late, Chowne gave a turn to his\nhorse\'s head, and the lather and foam of the spirited animal made a\nwhite curdle in the calm blue sea. The horse sprang gladly up the\nshingle crest--for the shore is very steep there--and he shook himself\nand scattered brine; and there were three other horses behind him. On\none of these sate Parson Jack, and two huntsmen on the other twain, and\nthe faces of these were as red as fire with hurry and indignation.\n\nOnly Chowne\'s wicked face was white, and settled with calm fury; and his\nstyle of address to us, just as if we were nothing but dogs of his\nkennel.\n\n""Ho, you scoundrels!"" he shouted out, ""hold oars, and let me parley\nyou.""\n\nAt this I made a signal to my crew to slack from rowing; and I stood up\nin the boat, and said, ""What can we do for your Reverence?""\n\n""Nothing for me, rogues; but much for yourselves. I will give you five\npounds for that child in the stern. I want him for knife-cleaning.""\n\n""Would your Worship think fifty too much for him? We put him at fifty,\nyour Worship.""\n\n""Fifty, you robbers! Well, then, fifty. Ten times his value to any one.\nBut I have a fancy for him.""\n\n""Would your Worship mind saying five hundred down? Look at his hair: he\nis worth it."" For we had washed him in the brook; and his hair in drying\nwas full of gold.\n\n""Who are you?"" he shouted, controlling himself, as his habit was, when\noutbreak became useless. For the dignity of my demeanour, and the\nnobility of my uniform, also the snowiness of my hair, combined to\ndefeat the unerring quickness of his rapid and yet cold eyes. And so I\nreplied with an elegant bow--\n\n""Your Reverence, it so happens that my name is \'Old Davy Llewellyn.\'""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nTAMING OF THE SAVAGES.\n\n\nAfter a most successful cruise, we returned to our Bellona, and were\nreceived as behoves success, with ever so many rounds of cheers. It was\ntrue that we had sent before us, and now brought in, an awkward lot; but\nit is beautiful to see how in a large ship\'s company, and under a good\ncommander, mere coaster fellows become true seamen, and even\nland-lubbers learn how to walk. Captain Drake Bampfylde did me the\nhonour of asking my advice, as soon as his own opinion was settled; and\nI said no more than ""Bay of Biscay,"" which was his own opinion. Here the\nvery utmost of a noble sea awaited us, and none of our landsmen had any\nheart for fat, or even for lean stuff. We let them go on for a day,\nperpetually groaning, and after that we provided for each a gallon of\nsalt water, and gave it them through the ship\'s trumpet, until they\nentirely ceased from noise.\n\nThese prudent measures brought them into such a wholesome state of\nmind, that really a child might lead them, as by one of the prophets\nmentioned, when I read my Bible. All of our new hands, I mean, except\nHezekiah, and the three wild men.\n\nUnfortunate Master Perkins could not enter into the spirit of our\nexertions for his benefit; because his mind was unsettled with knowing\nthe hardship both of his back and front. For his back was covered with\nraw places sitting amiss to the fit of his clothes, while the forward\npart of his body became too hollow to yield him comfort. But, strange to\nsay, his wrath was kindled not against us for these misfortunes, but\nagainst his wife Hepzibah, because she had not predicted them. And for\nthe greater part of a week, the poor fellow lay in a perfect craze upon\nthe orlop-deck, while the ship was rolling heavily. Nothing could\npersuade him but that he was the prophet Jonah in the belly of the\nwhale, and he took the stowage of our cables for the whale\'s intestines.\nYou could hear him even from the main deck screaming at the top of his\nvoice, ""Wallow not, O whale! O whale! Lord, Thy servant repenteth, only\nlet not this whale wallow so."" So that in spite of all his tricks,\nhypocrisy, pride, and gluttony, I could not help taking compassion upon\nhim, and having a hammock rigged tenderly for him, so that his empty and\nhelpless body fell into a deep sleep as long as the prophet himself\ncould have had it. For I never could show myself at Bridgend, if through\nmy means Hezekiah found the sea his churchyard. On the other hand, the\nthree wild men took their visitation from a wholly different point of\nview. They had never heard either of God or the devil, and could not\nbelieve themselves even worth the interference of either Power. For they\ndid not believe that their souls were immortal (as I suppose they must\nhave been), nor were they even aware of possessing anything more than a\nbody apiece. My own idea of treatment was, that to bring them into\nself-respect, we should flog the whole three very soundly, and\nhandsomely pickle them afterwards; nor could I see any finer method of\ncuring them of their hairiness. But Captain Bampfylde, who showed the\nstrangest interest in these savages, would on no account have them\nflogged until they gave occasion. He said that their ideas of justice\nmight be thrown into a crooked line, if the cat-and-nine-tails were\npromiscuously administered. Whereas I knew that the only way to make a\nman dwell upon justice is to give him a taste of the opposite. He values\nthe right after this, because he thinks there is none of it left upon\nearth.\n\nSo for the present these three ""Jack Cannibals,"" as our tars entitled\nthem, sate apart and messed apart--and a precious mess it was of it.\nThey soon got over the ""Marly Mary,"" as the Crappos call it; and we\ntaught them how to chew tobacco, which they did, and swallowed it. Only\ntheir fear of the waves was such that they could not look over the side\nof the ship, or even out of a porthole. After a few days we fell in with\npelting showers of hail and sleet, with a bitter gale from the\nnorth-north-west. I saw the beauty of this occasion to show mankind\ntheir need of clothes; therefore I roused up these three poor fellows,\nand had them thrown into a salting-tub full of ice-cold water. This made\ntheir teeth chatter bravely, and then we started them up the rigging,\nwith a taste of rope\'s end after them. They ran up the ratlines faster\nthan even our very best hands could follow them, because of the power\nstill left in their feet, through never having owned a shoemaker; but in\nthe main-top they pulled up, and the wind went shivering through them.\n\nMeanwhile I was sedately mounting (as my rank required now) with a very\nold pilot\'s coat, well worn out, hanging over my left arm.\n\n""Here, Jack!"" I cried to the biggest one; ""take this, and throw it over\nyou, to keep your poor bones warm.""\n\nThe sheaves of the blocks were white with snow (which they always seem\nto be first to take), and so were the cleats and the weather side of\ntopmast and top-gallant-mast. When you see this, you may make up your\nmind to have every rope frosted ere morning. Therefore Jack Cannibal\nlooked at the coat, and around it, as a monkey does.\n\n""Put it on,"" I cried; ""poor fellow! put it on to cover you.""\n\nHe nodded and laughed, as if I were making some joke which he ought to\nunderstand, and then he threw the warm coat round his body (now quite\nblue from cold), but without any perception of sleeves, or skirts, or\nanything else, except, as it were, like a bit of thatching. And after\nthat he helped us to civilise the rest; so that in course of time we had\nthem in decency far superior to the average show of Scotchmen. And in\nabout the same course of time, Cannibal Jack, I do assure you, became a\nvery good seaman, and a wonderfully honest fellow, without any lies in\nhim. And yet he said things better than the finest lies that could be\ntold, all coming out of his oddness, and his manner of taking tameness.\nAnd if a roaring sound of laughter came to the ears of an officer (such\nas never could be allowed in the discipline of war-time), the officer\nalways lifted lip, to have a smile accordingly, and said to himself, ""I\nshould like to know what Cannibal Jack has said to them.""\n\nThe two other naked ones, Dick and Joe--as we christened them out of a\nbucket of tar, without meaning any harm to them--never could be entirely\ncured of their hereditary shortcomings. We taught them at last to wear\nclothes, by keeping a sharp leather strap always handy, against which\ntheir only protection was a good watch coat, or a piece of sailcloth; so\nthat after a great deal of pleasantry, we set the ship tailor to work\nfor them. But no possible amount of strap, nor even cat-and-nine-tails\nadministered by our boatswain\'s mate (a most noble hand at wielding it),\ncould prevail upon them to abandon their desire for the property of\ntheir messmates. They even had the arrogance, as their English grew more\nfluent, to attempt to reason it out with us.\n\n""Father David,"" said Cannibal Dick, for they had agreed that now I was\ntheir patron, even as Chowne had been; ""you take the Crappo ship, the\nenemy you call it, and then you leave them all their goods, not touch\none of anything, and hand back the ship to him.""\n\n""Dick, none but a savage would talk such rubbish. We keep the ship, and\nall it holds, and put the men in prison.""\n\n""There for you now, there for you! And you beat us because we take not a\ngreat ship, but some little thing lying about in a ship, from our\nenemies.""\n\n""Will you never see things aright, Dick? We are not your enemies, we are\nyour friends; and to steal things from us is robbery.""\n\n""You call it friends to steal us from our place, and people, and warm\ndry sands, and put us on this strange great wetness, where no mushrooms\ngrow, and all we try to eat goes into it. And then you beat us, and\ndrive us up trees such as we never saw before, and force us to hide in\nthese dreadful things!""\n\nHere he pointed to his breeches with a gaze of such hopeless misery,\nthat I felt it would be an unkind thing to press him with further\nargument. However, the boy was enough to make up for a far worse lot\nthan these were. We soaped him most powerfully, to begin with, even up\nto the skin of his eyelids, and he made no more objection than a\nChristian child might have offered. And after we had scraped him dry\nwith the rough side of a spencer, he came out bright, I do assure you,\nand was such a model figure that we said to one another that he had some\nright to go naked. For his skin was now as fair and soft as the opening\nout of a water-lily, while his golden curls spread out, like flowers of\nthe frogbit. Also his shoulders so nicely turned, and the slope of his\nsides so clever, with arms and legs of such elegant mould, being thick\nand thin in the proper places, and as straight as a well-grown parsnip;\nthen, again, his ankles clear, and feet of a character never beheld\nafter any shoemaking.\n\nOur common fellows made so much of this superior little chap, that I was\ncompelled to interfere, and show my resolution: and this required to be\ndone with some small sense of how to do it; otherwise the boy might take\nthe turn of sour grapes with them, and be bullied even more than he had\nbeen petted thitherto. Moreover, all the other boys in the ship were\nlonging to fight with him, which (as he was the smallest of all, and not\nbrought up in a Christian manner) would have afforded him no fair play\nfor his nice short nose, or his soft blue eyes. The little dear was as\nbrave as a lion, and ready to fight any one of them; and he used to\nstand up to my elbow, suing for permission. And now he began to talk so\nwell, that it was very hard upon him not to be allowed to fight a bit;\naccording to the natural issue of all honest converse. However, I would\nnot be persuaded, loving his pretty face as I did; and I fear that he\nhad unhappy times, through the wickedness of the other boys. Having a\nstronger sense of mistake than afforded me any happiness--in the thick\nof my rank and comforts--I could not find any ease until everything,\nlooked at anyhow, and from all bearings contemplated, lay before our\nCaptain. He thought, enough to look wise; and then, he said that really\nI was fit to see to such little things myself. He had heard of a small\nboy covered over with a great deal of yellow hair; this should have been\nfetched off long ago; and what was the barber kept for? Thus it always\ndoes befall me, to be thrown back, without guidance, on my own\nresources. And even Lieutenant Bluett, with whom I next went to hold\ncounsel, was more inclined to stretch and gape, after a heavy spell on\ndeck, than to bring his mind to bear upon this child\'s adventures.\n\n""Send the poor little beggar in,"" he said, ""and let me look at him, if I\ncan keep my eyes open. Llewellyn, you always did love savages.""\n\n""Lieutenant, you would not like me to account you in the number.""\n\n""Davy, you might fairly do it, when I come off deck, like this. Send him\nin, ere I snooze, old fellow.""\n\nThis I did; and when the boy entered, shyly putting one hand to his\nforelocks (as I had instructed him), a beam of the newly-risen sun broke\nin through a bull\'s eye, and made a golden frame for him. In the middle\nof this he looked so innocent and so comely, and at the same time so\nwell bred, that Master Rodney\'s sleepy eyes fell open with wonder at\nhim. This was my doing, of course, entirely. ""Soap and discipline"" is my\nsignal to the next generation; and nothing else can counteract all the\nheresies around us. Therefore this little boy\'s cheeks were brighter\nthan any rose, from towelling; and his beautiful eyes without speck of\ndirt; and the top of his head as sweet and curly as a feathering\nhyacinth.\n\nWhen I perceive that I have had the luck to make an impression my rule\nis to say nothing at all, but appear to be unaware of it. This rule is\nfounded on common-sense; and it took me so long to find it out, that it\nought to be worth something. Otherwise, what offence one gives! And not\nonly that, but consider how seldom the man who succeeds deserves it. Any\nmodest man, like me, upon any moderate success, is bound to examine\nhimself, and feel less confidence than he used to have. His success is\nenough to prove, according to the ways of the world, that he never can\nhave deserved it.\n\nThis remembrance led me now to abstain from even patting ""Harry"" (as we\nhad named this little fellow) on his golden head at all, lest I should\nmanifest undue pride in a creature of my creation. For such he was,\nbeyond all mistake; and it would have given me pleasure to back him for\na crown against any boy in our fleet, or any three in the whole French\nnavy; taking age, of course, and size, into consideration.\n\n""What a fine little fellow!"" said Rodney Bluett; ""why, he ought to be a\nmidshipman. I had no idea your savages could turn out such young ones. I\nmust see what I can do for him, Davy. Only I can\'t think of anything\nnow.""\n\nPerceiving that I was likely to do more harm than good by pressing the\nmatter just then, I took little Harry away with me, and found him quite\nfull of the young lieutenant\'s brave appearance and kindly smile. In a\nword, they were pleased with one another so heartily, and so lastingly,\nthat it was the luckiest day, perhaps, of poor little Harry\'s unlucky\ncareer, when I first commended him to the notice of the Honourable\nRodney.\n\nFor this latter was now not only a general favourite in the ship, but\nalso a great power; being our second luff, and twice as active as our\nfirst was. He took the boy under his special care, and taught him all\nsorts of ennobling things--how to read, and write, and spell, and clean\nboots, and wait at breakfast. So that I felt many qualms sometimes,\nquite apart from all narrow methods of regarding anything, and springing\nfrom the simple fear that the child might be spoiled for his station in\nlife, and fail to become a good seaman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nUPON FOREIGN SERVICE.\n\n\nAt length, when all sailors\' hearts were sick with vain hopes of some\nenterprise, France did a truly bold thing by declaring war against Great\nBritain. Those people before this had given occasion for the strongest\nscandal, by taking their King and Queen in a dastardly manner, and\ncutting their heads off. Indignation and hot hatred ran throughout\nEngland and Wales, at the news; but our Government did no more than\npolitely request that the London agent of these cut-throats should\nwithdraw.\n\nNevertheless I cannot be wrong--as my pension comes from Government--in\nsaying that to my mind the British Government, at this noble crisis,\nbehaved in a most forbearing, prudent, Christian, generous, glorious,\nand magnanimous manner. They waited for war to be proclaimed by France,\nbefore they accepted it. And then they proved themselves as wholly\nunready as they ought to be. What finer state of feeling can be shown by\nany country?\n\nIt must have been either the end of February, or the early part of\nMarch, in the year of grace 1793, when we heard of this grand and\nmomentous affair. And I remember the date by this, that the onions were\nsprouted, and we were compelled to make shift with shallots. For calling\nat Falmouth to victual a little, we sent three boats ashore, and I of\ncourse was in command of one. And though we spread abroad and ransacked\nall the Cornish gardeners\' hoards, and gave them a taste of boat-hooks,\nbecause they had no proper things, not an onion could we find, except\nwith a crooked thumb to it. Nor were the young ones yet fit to pull;\nand this fixes the date to a week or so.\n\nAnd now we found that the whole of us were to be turned over, while the\nBellona was refitting, to the 74-gun ship Defence, with orders for the\nWest Indies at once--as was generally believed--to protect our shipping\nand commerce there.\n\nFor although the war had been so very long looked forward to, our\nGovernment was not ready yet, but had to send squadrons right and left,\nto see to our foreign interests; while Portsmouth, Chatham, and even\nLondon, had very few ships to defend them. Our charity never begins at\nhome; as poor Bardie\'s did in her copy-book. However, it chanced to turn\nout all right, because the other side was quite as much abroad as we\nwere.\n\nSome of our men were inclined to grumble, at having barely a spree\nashore, when they longed for a turn at home again. But the Admiralty\nsettled that, by not paying their back-wages; which is the surest way of\nall for keeping a fellow well up to his work. His temptation for running\nis gone, because he has no cash to run with; neither do his people want\nhim while in that condition. This he knows well, and it makes him think;\nand nine times out of ten he resolves to double what is due to him, and\nreally pocket it when again due, and almost be admired by his own wife.\n\nTherefore most part of us tumbled over from the Bellona into the\nDefence, after some liberty ashore--which, for a godly man like me, was\nnothing more than a trial. Captain Drake Bampfylde worked harder than\neven Parson Chowne\'s horses were said to do; and as for me----but I\nwill not say, for it now becomes unbecoming. Enough that the Defence\ncleared outward of the No-man buoy, the very day three weeks from the\ndate of the Bellona standing inwards. We had the wind at E.N.E., as it\nalways is in spring-time.\n\nNow it may seem out of place, and even very rude on my part; but I could\nnot altogether help a strong desire to know how our Captain this time\nmanaged in the matter of the female sex. I had my own feelings towards\npoor young Polly, and a hankering to let her see me (which, however,\nmust not now be gratified on either side), and of course a man feels,\nwhen this is the case, that another man must be like him. However, the\nrules of the service forbade me to put any questions on private affairs\nto an officer thus set over me; and as for observing him, that was\nbelow me, even if time had availed for it. Heaviside also had shown such\nill feeling and even downright ingratitude towards me, simply because my\nposition and rank had compelled me to teach him his distance, which he\nwas somehow too stupid to learn (especially since his rash elevation,\nand appointment as our chief boatswain, which made it the more incumbent\nupon me to preserve a firm attitude); this fellow, I say, was so utterly\nwanting in that deference which the Master of a line-of-battle ship not\nonly has a right to expect, but is even bound to exact, that I could not\nnow approach him with inquiries about our Captain. And this became\ntenfold more painful, as soon as I saw that he knew something.\n\nWhat French sailors could have a chance with a fleet under Sir John\nJervis? I cannot tell how many islands we took, for we could not stop to\ncount them. We caught just the tail of the hurricane of the 12th and\n13th of August, which ever will be remembered as the most terrible ever\nknown. None of us had the luck to see the pine bulkhead blown through\nthe palm-tree, or the whole of a sugar-estate set down on the other side\nof the mountain; but a sailor asks credit for his stories, because he\nhas given it: and otherwise no tales can go on.\n\nI need not dwell on our victories here, except for the sake of Harry\nSavage, as we had dubbed the poor Nympton boy, for want of legitimate\nsurname. In one little skirmish ashore somewhere, I think in San\nDomingo, this little fellow, by genuine courage and unusual nimbleness,\nsaved the life of his friend and protector, our Lieutenant Bluett. For\nwhile the lieutenant was engaged, sword to sword, with one vile\nrepublican, another of yet more rampant nature made at him, as it were\nflankwise, and must have given him a bitter stab, if Harry had not with\na sudden jump grappled the rogue by the leg so tightly, that down he\ncame on his face with a curse, so far as their language enables them.\nAnd we were so enraged, I assure you, at the duplicity of this fellow,\nthat we borrowed a dirk from a little middy, and gave it to Harry to\nstick him with. But this our young savage refused to do, and turned\nquite pale at the thought of it, so that we placed that Equality man at\nthe mercy of the French Royalists, who were acting with us at that\nperiod: and these made very short work with him, as justice demanded\nwith a ringleader of pestilential principles.\n\nAlso, in a manner which true modesty forbids to dwell upon--because\nneither of us had clothes on--I saved the life, before very long, of our\nnew boatswain Heaviside. This worthy fellow was swimming along in his\nusual independent style, after kicking his good wife\'s shackles off,\nwhen I--having taken the inside of him, as his superior\nofficer--discovered a shark of unusual size desirous to swallow our\nboatswain. That this should never come to pass was my resolve\nimmediately, although I could not quite see how to be in time to stop\nit. For Heaviside, with his usual conceit, and desire to show himself\noff, was floating on his back, with arms laid square, and beard on\nbreast, and legs spread out like rolling-pins. And the shark at twenty\nknots an hour split the blue water towards him.\n\nAny man but myself would have given him over, or left all the rest to\nhelp him, especially after his utterly republican want of deference. To\nme, however, such want of sympathy was almost impossible, so that I swam\nwith all speed to Heaviside, where he lay floating grandly.\n\n""Look there!"" I shouted; ""all up with you, Ben, unless you capitulate.""\nAnd with these words, I pointed out the fin of the shark advancing.\nRoyal sharks we always called them, being the largest sharks in the\nworld, in and around Port Royal. Heaviside had his fat legs foremost,\nand the royal shark stopped to look at them.\n\n""Will you or will you not?"" I asked, while preserving with some\ndifficulty a proper position behind him--for even a royal shark could\nhave wanted nothing more after Heaviside.\n\n""Oh, Davy, Davy, I will,"" he answered; ""only, only save me.""\n\nThe look which he gave was now enough to make me sink small questions,\nespecially as the poor fellow managed, being a first-rate swimmer, to\noffer me almost foremost to the jaws of the shark just opening.\nTherefore, as this latter creature rolled on his side to make at us,\nwhat did I do but a thing which none except a great fisherman could have\ndone? To wit, I plucked from its strings the boatswain\'s heavy periwig\n(which had often vexed me, on account of its pretension), and clapping\nit on a piece of sugar-cane, which lay floating handy, down the wide\njaws of the shark I thrust it, to improve his appetite.\n\nFaithless people may doubt my word, when solemnly I declare to them that\nthis great monster of the waters coughed and sneezed like a Christian.\nAnd we found him rolling dead the next morning, with this obstruction in\nhis throat. Thus by much caution and presence of mind, I saved our\nboatswain not only from the jaws of a shark, but from a far more fatal\nerror, arrogance and downright contumacy, which had made him refuse to\ntouch his hat to his superior officer. Now I need not have mentioned\nthis little affair, except that it bears upon my story, inasmuch as it\nreconciled Master and boatswain, and enabled them both to work together\nfor the benefit of their Captain. Among poor Heaviside\'s many weak\nqualities, one of the most conspicuous was a resolute curiosity. This\ncompelled him to open a great part of the breadth of his nature to the\nlegitimate, or otherwise, affairs of his fellow-creatures.\n\nAnd being an orthodox champion of wedlock (from the moment he left his\nwife and children, without any power to draw on him), he helped all the\nrest of the world in this way, as a host recommends his hot pickles.\n\nTherefore he had been chosen, by very bad taste upon somebody\'s part,\nand an utter forgetfulness of me, to be up at our Captain\'s snap of a\nwedding, and to say ""Amen"" to it. What could be worse than a huddle of\nthis kind, and a broad scattering afterwards? If they had only invited\nme, both sense and honesty would have been there; as well as a man not\nto be upset by things, however female.\n\nThat was their own concern, of course; and it misbecame me to think of\nit; and I saw, upon further consideration, that my sturdy honesty might\nnot quite have suited them. For women are able, with the help of men, to\nwork themselves up to anything. You may call them the shot and men the\npowder; or you may take quite another view, and regard them as the\npowder, with a superior man at the touchhole. Anyhow, off they go; and\nwho shall ask the reason?\n\nFor from what Heaviside told me, it seems that the Captain and his fair\nIsabel, before our present cruise began, had resolved that no one should\never be able legally to sever them. But one special term of the compact\nwas that the outer world should have no acquaintance with things that\nhappened between them. In other words, that they should leave their\nexcellent friends and relatives all in the dark about this matter, as\nwell as save the poor Captain\'s oath, by quitting each other\nimmediately. It is to the utmost extent beyond my own experience to\ndeny, that this is the wisest of all arrangements (if there can be\nanything wise) after the deed of wedlock; for what can equal severance\nin the saving of disagreement? However, they had not the wisdom as yet\nto look at it in this light, and the one wept and the other sighed, when\nthey parted at the churchyard gate; for the Defence must sail at 1 P.M.\nThe lady had been content to come and dwell in a very dirty village of\nthe name of Gosport, so that the licence might be forthcoming from\nproper people when paid for. Because, of course, in her own county,\nnothing could have been done without ten thousand people to talk of it.\nAnd thus they were spliced, without hoisting flag; for ever spliced,\nboth in soul and in law (which takes the lead of the other one), and yet\nin body severed always, till there should come fair repute.\n\nA common man of my rank in life, and having no more than common-sense,\nmust often find himself all abroad with wonder about his superiors. They\nseem to look at things as if everything and every person were looking\nback at them again, instead of trusting to the Lord to oversee the whole\nof it. If I had been of the proper age, and a lovely rich maid in love\nwith me, would I have stopped even twice to think what the world might\nsay about us? Heaviside\'s opinion was that the lady wished to hide\nnothing whatever, but proclaim before all people where and when, and\nwhom she wedded, and how proud she was of him. But the Captain, in his\nkind regard and tenderness for her feelings, durst not expose her to the\npain and sense of wrong which might ensue upon his name coming forward\nthus, with the county thinking as it did, and himself not there to\nvindicate. And of course he knew with what vigour and skill vile Parson\nChowne would set to at once to blacken his character, and to make his\nbride a most unhappy one. Therefore Sir Philip Bampfylde and the ancient\nEarl of Pomeroy were the only persons present of their rank and kindred;\nand both of these confessed the wisdom of the Captain\'s arguments.\n\nNow on the 30th of April 1794, at about the hour of sundown, our anchor\nwas scarcely beginning to bite in Cawsand Bay, when the barge of the old\nPort-Admiral was alongside of us. We had long been foregathering what we\nwould do as soon as we got ashore again; but now we could only shake\nheads and fear that the whole would be disappointment. And thus it\nproved, and even worse for many of our company, inasmuch as our orders\nwere to make sail at once for St Helens and there to join the Channel\nfleet under Admiral Lord Howe. Therefore we carried on again with a gale\nfrom south-west to favour us, and on the first of May we brought up in\nthe midst of a large society.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nEXILES OF SOCIETY.\n\n\nA finer sight was never seen than we had now around us; for all the\nconvoy was come together, as well as the British fleet empowered to\nprotect them. I stood in our foretop and counted 152 large sail, nearly\n50 of which were men-of-war, and all the rest goodly merchantmen. A\nsight like this not only strengthens a Briton\'s faith in Providence, but\nputs him into a quiet pride concerning his King and country.\n\nWe had scarcely swung to our moorings ere we had signal from the\nAdmiral, ""Not a man to be allowed ashore. Water and victual all night,\nand be ready to weigh again at daybreak."" Of course we did so, though a\nhard thing upon us; and new hands desired to grumble, until Captain\nBampfylde rigged the gratings. Heaviside now was known to have such a\nswing of arm, with a flick to it, never being satisfied with his mate\'s\nadministration, that never a man of patriotic sentiments encroached on\nhim. We all determined to sail once more, and let the French see what\nour nature was (although they might hope to find it spoiled, by our\nbeing away from home so much); especially when we heard that they had\n350 sail or more of merchantmen coming home, all very rich, and fattened\nup for capture. What we wanted, therefore, was to see our own good\ntraders free from any chance of piracy, and at the same time to stop\nthose French from wicked importations. If in both points we might\nsucceed, and give battle afterwards, our gratitude to the Lord would\nalmost equal our own glory. And we heard that the mob in Paris would\nstarve, failing of all this American fleet.\n\nOn the 2d of May the wind fetched back to its proper place at that time\nof year, north-north-east, with snow-clouds always ready to endorse it;\nand thus we slipped from our moorings and went quietly down Channel.\nConcerning the rest, we have no cause to plead for man\'s indulgence.\nThe Lord continued to baffle us, and would not give us any help to close\nquarters with the enemy. We fought three days of rolling battle, ending\non the 1st of June, after two days of fog interrupting, and not a breath\nof sleep four nights. Every one says that we fought very well, having\neverything so much against us, and the French fleet far superior,\ncarrying also a representative of the human race, large and fat and\nfluent, of the name of John Bone Andrews, who wrote a noble account of\nthis action, although before it began his feelings led him to seek\nsecurity in a hole far below the water-line.\n\nBut one of the strangest things ever seen, and thoroughly worth\nconsidering, was the behaviour of our two savages under heavy fire. Two,\nI say, although we had three, because Cannibal Jack behaved most\nsteadily, and like a thorough Christian. But the two others most\nstrongly proved their want of civilisation and gross ignorance of war,\ninasmuch as no sooner did they see the opening of bloodshed round them,\nthan mad they became--as mad, I assure you, as any March hares, the\nbrace of them. In the thick of our combat with the Towerful, up and down\nthe deck these fellows danced in the most conspicuous places, as if\ninviting every shot, and cracking their knuckles and jabbering. I was\nfor lashing them to the mainmast, but Captain Bampfylde would not allow\nit; he said that their spirited conduct might encourage and cheer the\nrest of us. And indeed it was strange to see how the shot flew around\nwithout striking them.\n\nNow these poor fellows showed so much attachment and strong confidence\ntowards me, that when we cast anchor in Plymouth Sound (being detached\nfor refitment there, together with eight other ships of the line), I\ntook it entirely upon myself to see them safe home, and to answer for\nthem. Our ship had been knocked about so much, that she needed a\nthorough good overhauling, and many of us had a month\'s leave of\nabsence, while carpenters, caulkers, and riggers were working. And these\nthree savages outwent all of us in longing to see their homes again. So\nit struck me that I might both satisfy them and also gratify myself a\nlittle, by taking them under my escort as far as their native mud-holes,\nand then for a week perhaps enjoying good young Polly\'s society. Captain\nBampfylde not only agreed to this, but said that he should not care\ntwopence if he never saw two of their number again. He meant, of course,\nDick and Joe, whose habits of larceny never could be thrashed out;\nwhereas Cannibal Jack was now become as honest a hand as myself almost,\nand a valuable fore-topman. Having pledged my word to bring this one\nback safe, and the others as well (if they chose to come), I set forth\nafoot for a cruise across Devon, than which, in the summer, with plenty\nof money, what can be more delightful? I would gladly have taken young\nHarry Savage, now a fine lad of fifteen years, so far as one might guess\nit; but Jack declared that he must not come, for some reason not to be\ntold to me.\n\nNow it was the flush of summer, very nearly twelve years from the time I\nfirst began with. Sunny hedges spread their overlap of roses over us,\nwhile the glad leaves danced in time with light and shade to foster\nthem. Every bank of every lane was held at home with flowers, nourished\nby some flitting rill that made a tinkle for them. And through every\ngate almost, whenever there was a man to look, the spread of feathered\ngrasses ran, like water with the wind on it.\n\nEven a sailor may see such things, and his heart rejoice and be glad in\nthem, and his perilous life for a while have rest without any thought of\nanything. Be that so, neither Dick nor Joe ever made glance at anything\nexcept the hen-roosts near the road, or the haunt of a young rabbit in\nthe hedge, or the nesting of a partridge. I kept the poor fellows from\ndoing harm, by precept and example too; yet we had a roast fowl every\nnight, except when it was a boiled one. And finding myself in my\nsixty-fourth year, what could I do but put up with it?\n\nIt must be threescore miles, I think, even according to the shortest\ncut, from Plymouth to Nympton-on-the-Moors, and we wandered out of the\nway, of course, especially after guinea-fowls, which are most deluding\ncreatures, but roast even better than their eggs boil. Also, we got into\ncherry orchards of a very noble breed; so that we spent a whole day and\ntwo nights, without any power to say farewell. And though the farmer\'s\nwife put up both hands to us at the window, she sent out the maid to say\nthat we need not be frightened, if we were real sailors. After giving\nthis girl a kiss (to let her know what our profession was), I sent in\nword that here was the Master of his Majesty\'s ship Defence, which had\ndefended the British Empire, in the late great victory. That night they\nmade all of us drunk, except me.\n\nUpon these sweet little incidents I must venture to dwell no longer,\nwhile having so much of my yarn in the slack, and none but myself to\ntauten it. Enough that we came in about ten days to the genuine naked\ncolony, without any meaning of surprise, but now as great ambassadors.\nAnd the least that we all expected was a true outburst of wild\nwelcoming. Cannibal Jack had announced his intention to convert his\nrelatives, while Dick and Joe only shook their heads, and seemed to\ndoubt the advantage of it. But we need not have thought of the matter\ntwice, for, strange to say, not one of the savages would for a moment\nacknowledge us. All the barbarous tribe stood aloof and scowled at their\nold members with utter abhorrence and contempt, as if at some vast\ndegeneracy. Even Jack\'s wife, or the woman who might in humanity have\nbeen called so, stood moping and mowing at him afar, as if his clothes\nmade a sheep of him, while he with amazement regarded her as if she were\nonly a chimpanzee. Whereupon all of them set up a yell, and rushed with\nsuch pelting of mud at us, that we thought ourselves lucky to make our\nescape without any further mischief.\n\nAfter hauling out of action in this most inglorious manner, we brought\nup to refit and revictual at the nearest public-house, a lonely hut\nwhere four roads met, and the sign hung from an ancient gibbet. Here we\nwere treated very kindly, and for very little money, so that I was quite\nastonished after all our feeding. And I happened to say to the landlady\nthat I was surprised to find honesty within a league of Parson Chowne.\n\n""Oh, sir, do you know that dreadful man?"" she answered, with her apron\nup; ""or would you like to see him, sir?""\n\n""Madam,"" said I, with that bow of mine which takes the women captive, ""I\nshould like to see him wonderfully; only without his seeing me.""\n\n""Of course, of course. All people say that, because of the evil eye he\nhath. This house doth belong to him. He be coming for the rent again at\ntwo o\'clock, and he never faileth. Every farthing will be ready now,\nthrough your honour\'s generosity; and if so be you steps in here, when\nyou hear me give three knuckles at the door, you may see him and welcome\nfor nothing; only you must not speak for ever so.""\n\nThe landlady showed me a little cellar, opening from our sitting-room,\nand having a narrow half-boarded hatchway bearing upon her sanded\nparlour, where she designed to receive the Parson. And then she was half\nafraid lest I might make a noise and so betray her. But almost before I\nhad time to assure her of my perfect secrecy, the dash of horse\'s hoofs\nwas heard, and the sound of a man\'s voice shouting.\n\n""Well done!"" said I to myself; ""good Parson, years have not decreased\nthee.""\n\nHis strong step rang on the lime-ash floor, and his silver spurs made a\njingle, and lo, there he stood in the sanded parlour, as noble a Chowne\nas ever. There was not the sign of a spot of weakness or relenting about\nhim; on his shaven face no bloom of greyness, nor in his coal-black hair\none streak. As vigorous, springy, and strenuous seemed he, as when he\nleaped on board and thrashed me, nearly twelve years agone, as I do\nbelieve.\n\n""Woman, where is my money?"" he cried, with the old pale frown overcoming\nhim; ""twice I have given you time. You know what I always do\nthereafter.""\n\n""Yes, sir, I know what your Reverence doth. Your Reverence never calleth\nlaw, but taketh horsewhip to the mans of us.""\n\n""Your memory is correct,"" he answered; ""my usual course is to that\neffect. I have brought my heaviest whip this time, for your husband has\nshown arrogance. Can you show cause why he should not have it?""\n\n""Yes, your Reverence, here it is. And God knows how we have scraped for\nit.""\n\nWith the glow of triumph which a man\'s face hardly ever shows, but a\nwoman\'s cannot be denied of, she spread before him all his rent upon an\nancient tray, and every piece of it was copper. Thirty-six shillings she\nhad to pay, and twenty-four times thirty-six was there for his Reverence\nto count. The hostess looked at him, with a chuckle brewing now under\nher apron strings, and ready to rise to her ample breast, and thence to\nher mouth, if expedient. But she mistook her customer.\n\n""Woman,"" said Chowne, in his deep low voice, which had no anger in it;\n""I am tired of signing warrants.""\n\n""Warrants, your Worship! For what, if you please?""\n\n""Warrants for thieves who are foisting sham Irish halfpennies on the\npublic. I see no less than seven of them in this sterling stuff of\nyours. Three months at the treadmill now for yourself and your husband.\nSay no more. You have tried a trick. Tiverton jail for you both\nto-morrow.""\n\nAnd there, if you wanted either of them, you must go to find them, only\ntwo days afterward, according to what I was told of it. No Welsh\ngentleman would have dreamed of behaving to his tenants thus, for trying\na little joke with him; but Chowne had no sense of any joke, unless\nhimself began it.\n\nOur three cannibals had been trembling at the sound of the Parson\'s\nvoice, believing that he would drive them back, and feeling that they\nhad no power to withstand his orders. But luckily we had made such a\nsmoke--all our savages having taken to the use of tobacco\ngloriously--that when the Parson put his head in, as he must do\neverywhere, he drew it back in double-quick time, for he hated the weed\nas Old Nick does. And then after calling his groom as a witness to the\nIrish coinage, he made him tie the whole of the rent-money in his\npocket-handkerchief, and off he set at a good round gallop to make out\nthe warrant. You may depend upon it that we four were very soon off as\nwell, and in the opposite direction, after subscribing a guinea among us\nto comfort the poor woman, who was sobbing her heart out at her mistake,\nand at the prospect (as seemed to me) of being confined, in more senses\nthan one, within the walls of a prison. For some time I found myself\nmuch at a loss about harbouring my convoy; for though I could trust Jack\nWildman--as I now began to call him--anywhere and with anything, this\nwas not the case with the other two, who could never be kept from\npicking up small things that took their fancy. We were shaping a course\nfor Narnton Court, where I intended to sling my own hammock, and Jack\'s\nas well, if agreeable; but I durst not offer to introduce Dick and Joe,\nfor the cause aforesaid. Moreover, they had not yet acquired the manners\nof good society, which were no little insisted upon in Sir Philip\nBampfylde\'s kitchen. Therefore I thought myself very clever, when a\nsettlement of this question suddenly occurred to me.\n\nThis was no less than to settle them both under my old ferry-boat, if\nstill to be found as two years back, shored up and turned into a\nresidence. Their rations might be sent down to them, and what happier\nhome could they wish for, with the finest air in the world around them,\nas well as beautiful scenery? And if it should happen to leak a little\n(as seems only natural), what a blessed reflection for a man of due\nsentiments towards the Lord, that this water is dropping from heaven\nupon him, instead of rushing up to swallow him into that outrageous sea!\n\nAccordingly so we contrived this affair. Mr Jack Wildman was introduced,\nunder my skilful naval tactics, into the most accomplished circle on the\nquarter-deck of our head-cook. And he looked so very gently wild, and\nblushed in his clothes so beautifully, that there was not a maiden all\nover the place but longed to glance, unbeknown, at him. So that it\nseemed a most lucky thing that Polly was down with the small-pox, at a\nplace called Muddiford; wherein she had an uncle. Meanwhile Cannibals\nDick and Joe lived in the boat, as happily as if they had been born in\nit, and devoted their time to the slaying and cooking of Sir Philip\'s\nhares and rabbits. It was in vain that the gamekeepers did their best to\ncatch them. Dick and Joe could catch hares, as they boasted to me,\nalmost under the watchers\' noses; so noble was the result of uniting\ncivilised cunning with savage ingenuity.\n\nI can well believe that no other man, either of my rank or age, would\nhave ventured on the step which now I did resolve upon. This was no less\nthan to pay a visit to my poor little Polly, and risk all probabilities\nof being disfigured by small-pox. For several times it had crossed my\nmind, that although she was among relatives, they were not like a father\nor mother to her, and perhaps she might be but poorly tended, and even\nin need of money perhaps. For her very own aunt, our Mrs Cockhanterbury,\nwould not go nigh her, and almost shuddered when her name was mentioned.\nNow it seemed to be only fair and honest to let Sir Philip know my\nintention, so that he might (if he should see fit) forbid me to return\nto his mansion, bringing the risk of infection. But the General only\nshook his head, and smiled at that idea. ""If it be the will of God, we\nshall have it, of course,"" he said; ""and people run into it all the more\nby being over-timorous. And I have often thought it sinful to mistrust\nthe Lord so. However, you had better keep smoking a pipe, and not stay\nmore than five minutes; and perhaps you might just as well change your\nclothes before you come back, and sink the others to air for a week in\nthe river."" I was grieved to see him so entirely place his faith in\nProvidence, for that kind of feeling (when thus overdone) ends in what\nwe call ""fatalism,"" such as the very Turks have. So that I was pleased\nwhen he called me back, and said, ""Take a swim yourself, Llewellyn. I\nhear that you can swim five miles. Don\'t attempt that, but swim two, if\nyou like. Swim back to us from Barnstaple bridge, and I will have a boat\nto meet you, with a wholesome wardrobe.""\n\nThus was the whole of it arranged, and carried out most cleverly. I took\npoor Polly a bunch of grapes, from one of the Narnton vineries, as well\nas a number of nice little things, such as only a sailor can think of.\nAnd truly I went not a day too soon, for I found her in that weak\ncondition, after the fury of the plague is past, when every bit of\nstrengthening stuff that can be thought of, or fancied by, the feeble\none may turn the scale, and one cheering glance or one smiling word is\nas good as a beam of the morning. Then after a long walk, I made my\nswim, and a change of clothes, exactly as the General had commanded me.\n\nIn a fortnight afterwards where was I? Why, under the boat, in a burning\nmadness, without a soul to come nigh me, except Jack Wildman and Sir\nPhilip. These two, with the most noble courage, visited me through my\nsad attack of small-pox, as I was told thereafter, although at the time\nI knew no one. And at a distance around the boat, a ring of brushwood\nwas kept burning, day and night, to clear the air, and warn the unwary\nfrom entering. Everybody gave me up for a living Christian any more, and\nmy coffin was ordered at a handsome figure (as a death upon Narnton\npremises), ay, and made also, like that of the greatest man that I ever\ndid meet with. Not only this, but two Nonconformist preachers found out\n(as they always do) that in a weak period of my life, when dissatisfied\nwith my pension, I had been washed away by my poor wife into the\nscuppers of Dissent. Therefore they prepared two sermons on this\njudgment of the Lord, and called me a scapegoat; while goodness knows\nwhat care they took never to lay hands on me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nMANY WEAK MOMENTS.\n\n\nNothing less than steadfast faith, and an ancient British constitution,\ncan have enabled me to survive this highly-dappled period. It was not in\nmy body only, or legs, or parts I think nothing of, but in my brain that\nI felt it most, when I had the sense to feel it. And having a brain\nwhich has no right to claim exemption from proper work, because of being\nunder average, I happened to take a long time to recover from so many\nspots striking inwards. An empty-headed man might have laughed at the\nlittle drills into his brain-pan; but with me (as with a good bee-hive\nearly in October) there could not be the prick of a brad-awl but went\ninto honey. And so my brain was in a buzz for at least a twelvemonth\nafterwards.\n\nTherefore I now must tell what happened, rather as it is told to me,\nthan as myself remember it. Only you must not expect such truth, as I\nalways give, while competent.\n\nAfter the master of the ship Defence had proved so unable to defend\nhimself, General Sir Philip Bampfylde, with his large and quiet mind\nforbidding all intrusion, opened out a little of his goodness to Jack\nWildman. There are men of the highest station, and of noble intellect,\nwho do this, and cannot help it, when they meet a fellow-man with\nsomething in him like them. There is no vanity in it, nor even desire to\nconciliate; only a little touch of something understood between them.\nAnd now being brought so together perhaps by their common kindliness,\nand with the door of death wide open, as it were, before them, the\nwell-born and highly-nurtured baronet, and the lowly, neglected, and\nignorant savage, found (perhaps all the more clearly from contrast)\nsomething harmonious in each other. At any rate they had a good deal of\ntalk by the side of the lonely river, where even the lighters kept\naloof, and hugged to the utmost the opposite shore. And the General,\nfinding much amusement in poor Jack\'s queer simplicity, and strange\nremarks upon men and things, would often relax without losing any of his\naccustomed dignity. So while they were speaking of death one day, Jack\nlooked at Sir Philip with an air of deep compassion and feeling, and\ntold him with tearful eyes how heartily he was grieved at one thing.\nBeing pressed as to what it was, he answered that it was Sir Philip\'s\nwealth.\n\n""Because,"" said he, ""I am sad when I think that you must go to hell,\nsir.""\n\n""I go to hell!"" Sir Philip exclaimed, with a good deal of rather\nunpleasant surprise; ""why should I do that, Jack? I never thought that\nyou entertained so bad an opinion of me.""\n\n""Your Honour,"" said Jack, having picked up some of my correct\nexpressions, ""it is not me; it is God Almighty. I was told afore ever I\nlearned to read, or ever heard of reading, how it was. And so it is in\nthe Bible now. Poor men go to heaven, rich men go to hell. It must be so\nto be fair for both.""\n\nThe General had too much sense to attempt to prove the opposite, and\nwould have thought no more about it, if Jack had dropped the subject.\nBut to do this at the proper moment requires great civilisation; while\non the other hand Jack sought comfort, needless to men of refinement.\n\n""Your Honour must go there,"" he said, with a nod of his head which was\nmeant to settle it; ""but there is one of your race, or family""--or\nwhatever word of that sort he employed, for he scarce could have come to\nany knowledge of things hereditary--""who will go to heaven.""\n\n""Many are gone there already--too many,"" answered Sir Philip, devoutly;\n""but tell me whom you mean, Jack. Do you mean my son the Captain?""\n\n""Him! no, no. I know better than that. It is plain where he must go to.""\n\n""Your Captain! you disloyal fellow. Why, you ought to be lashed to the\ntriangles. But who is it you are thinking of?""\n\n""I know, I know,"" said Jack, nodding his head; and no more could Sir\nPhilip get out of him. And whenever he tried to begin again, Jack\nWildman was more than a match for him, by feigning not to understand, or\nby some other of the many tricks which nature supplies, for\nself-defence, to the savage against the civilised. If I had been well, I\nmust have shelled this poor Jack\'s meaning out of him; whereas, on the\nother hand, but for my illness he might never have spoken. So it came to\npass that he was sent, entirely at Sir Philip\'s cost, and with a\nhandsome gratuity, to rejoin our Captain in Plymouth Sound, and to carry\nback Cannibals Dick and Joe, who had scoured away at great speed upon\nhearing of my sudden misfortune.\n\nNow I will tell you a very strange thing, and quite out of my\nexperience: even after small-pox, which enlarged and filled me with\ncharity, as well as what I had scarcely room for--increase of humility.\nThis is, that though Captain Bampfylde had some little spare time at\nPlymouth, he had such command of himself that he never went near his\nbeloved Isabel. Nothing could have so checked a man of heartiness and\nbravery, except the strongest power of honour, and a long time of\nchastisement. There was a lovely young woman, and here a fine though\nmiddle-aged man, her husband; they loved one another with heart and\nsoul, and they never met, but through a telescope! It may have been\nright, or it may have been wrong--I should have thought it wrong,\nperhaps, if the case had been my own--but they pledged their honour and\nkept it. Drake Bampfylde (like his father) had a strength of trust in\nProvidence. But this trust has no landed security, now that the Lord\nhas found the world so clever, that He need not interfere with it.\n\nThe 74-gun ship Defence was known to be the fastest sailer in the\nBritish Navy; not from her build alone, or balance, but from my careful\ntrim of her sails, and knowledge of how to handle her. Hours and hours I\nspent aloft, among lifts, and braces, and clue-garnets, marking the draw\nof every sail, and righting all useless bellying. So that I could now\nhave warranted her the first of our Navy to break the line, if rigged\naccording to my directions, and with me for her master. However (while I\nlay docked like this, careened I might say, and unlikely ever to carry a\nkeel again), the Defence, without my knowledge even, being new-masted,\nsailed to join the Channel Fleet, with Heaviside acting as her master;\nand as might have been expected, fell to leeward one knot in three. And\neven worse than this befell her; for in the second of those two\nmiserable actions, under Hotham in the year 1795, when even Nelson could\ndo nothing, the Defence having now another captain as well as a stupid\nmaster, actually backed her mizzen-topsail, in the rear of the enemy,\nwhen the signal was to fill and stand on. However, as even that famous\nship the Agamemnon did nothing that day, through getting no opportunity,\nwe must forgive poor Heaviside, especially as he was not captain. But\nthe one who ground his teeth the hardest, and could forgive nobody, was\nthe Honourable Rodney Bluett, now first lieutenant of the Defence. By\nthis time every one must desire to know why Captain Bampfylde was not\nthere, as he might have been, and might have made himself famous, but\nfor his usual ill-fortune. This had carried him to the East Indies,\nbefore the Defence had finished refitting; and there, with none of his\nold hands near him, he commanded a line-of-battle ship, under Commodore\nRainier; and after some hard work, and very fine fighting, drove the\nbrave Dutchmen out of the castle of Trincomalee, in August 1795, which\nwe came to hear of afterwards.\n\nThus it was that everybody seemed to be scattered everywhere. None of us\nhappened to hold together, except those three poor savages; and they, by\na sort of instinct, managed to get over accidents. For they stuck, with\nthat fidelity which is lost by education, to Rodney Bluett, as soon as\never poor Father Davy failed them. But this is a melancholy subject, and\nmust soon be done with.\n\nLet me, then, not dwell upon this visitation of the Lord for a moment\nlonger than the claims of nation and of kin combine to make it needful.\nNor did it seem to matter much for a long time what became of me. The\nvery first thing I remember, after months of wandering, has something to\ndo with the hush of waves, and the soft breath of heaven spread over me.\nAlso kind young voices seemed to be murmuring around me, with a dear\nregard and love, and sense of pretty watchfulness; and the sound of my\nnative tongue as soft as the wool of a nest to my bosom.\n\nBecause I was lying in a hammock, slung, by Colonel Lougher\'s orders,\nbetwixt the very same mooring-posts (at about half-tide in Newton Bay)\nwhich truly enabled the sons of Devon to make such a safe job of\nstealing his rocks. Not only the Colonel, but Lady Bluett, who generally\nled his judgment, felt by this time the pleasure of owing true gratitude\nto somebody. My fatherly care of the young lieutenant had turned him out\nso nobly.\n\nIt misbecomes me to speak of this; and it misbecame me to speak at all,\nwith the sea-breeze flowing over me, the first words of knowledge that I\nhad spoken for how long I know not. Nothing can be too high, or too low,\nfor human nature at both ends; but I ought to have known better than to\ndo the thing I did.\n\n""Give me a pipe,"" was all I said; and then I turned away, and cared not\nwhether I got my pipe, or whether the rising tide extinguished me.\n\n""Here is your pipe, sir,"" came in a beautiful voice from down below me;\n""and we have the tinder ready. Bunny, let me do it now.""\n\nThat pipe must have saved my life. Everybody said so. It came and went\nin curls of comfort through the hollow dying places of my head, that had\nnot even blood enough to call for it; and then it never left my soul\nuneasy about anything. Hammock and all must have gone afloat, with the\nrapid rise of the spring, except for Colonel Lougher\'s foresight.\n\nWho was it that watched me so, and would have waited by my side, until\nthe waves were over her? Who was it that kept on listening, to let me\nknow, while I could not speak? Who was it that gave a little bit of a\nsigh, every now and then, and then breathed hard to smother it? Who was\nit, or who could it be, in the whole wide world, but Bardie?\n\nNot only this, but when I began to be up to real sense again, the\nkindness of every one around me made me fit for nothing. In the\nweakness of expecting all to take advantage of me (as is done in health\nand spirits), all the weakness I could find was in my friends and\nneighbours always labouring to encourage me. This to my mind proves\nalmost the wrongness of expecting people to be worse than we are.\n\nThat winter was the most severe, all over Western Europe, known for\nfive-and-fifty years. I well remember the dreadful winter A.D. 1740,\nwhen the Severn was frozen with a yard of ice, and the whole of the\nBristol Channel blocked with icebergs like great hay-ricks. Twelve\npeople were frozen to death in our parish, and seven were killed through\nthe ice on the sea. The winter of 1795 was nothing to be compared to\nthat; nevertheless it was very furious, and killed more than we could\nspare of our very oldest inhabitants.\n\nAnd but for the extraordinary kindness of Colonel Lougher, that winter\nmust have killed not only me in my weak and worn-out condition, but also\nthe poor maid of Sker, if left to encounter the cold in that iceberg.\nFor, truly speaking, the poor old house was nothing else through that\nwinter. The snow in swirling sheets of storm first wrapped it up to the\nwindow-sills; and then in a single night overleaped gables, roofs, and\nchimney-tops. Moxy and Watkin passed a month of bitter cold and\ndarkness, but were lucky enough to have some sheep, who kept them warm\noutside, and warmed their insides afterwards. And after that the thaw\ncame. But all this time there was nobody in my little cottage at Newton,\nbut poor Roger Berkrolles, and how he kept soul and body together is\nknown to none save himself and Heaven. For Colonel Lougher and Lady\nBluett, at the very beginning of the frost, sent down my old friend,\nCrumpy the butler, to report upon my condition, and to give his candid\nopinion what was the best thing to do with me. After that long struggle\nnow (thanks to a fine constitution and the death of the only doctor\nanywhere on our side of Bridgend), I had begun to look up a little and\nto know the time of day. Crumpy felt my pulse, and nodded, and then\nprescribed the only medicine which his own experience in life had ever\nverified. Port wine, he said, was the only thing to put me on my legs\nagain. And this he laid before the Colonel with such absence of all\ndoubt, that on the very same afternoon a low and slow carriage was sent\nfor me, and I found myself laid in a very snug room, with the firelight\ndancing in the reflection of the key of the wine-cellar. Also here was\nBardie flitting, light as a gnat in spring-time, and Bunny to be had\nwhenever anybody wanted her. Only her scantling and her tonnage unfitted\nher for frigate-service.\n\nWhat had a poor old fellow like me--as in weak moments I called\nmyself--ever done, or even suffered, to deserve to find the world an Inn\nof good Samaritans? I felt that it was all of pure unreasonable\nkindness; the very thing which a man of spirit cannot bear to put up\nwith. I have felt this often, when our Parson discoursed about our\ngracious Lord, and all the things He did for us. A man of proper\nself-respect would like to have had a voice in it.\n\nThis, however (as Hezekiah told us in the cockpit, after we had pickled\nhim), might be safely attributed to the force of unregeneracy; while a\nman who is down in luck, and constitution also, trusts to any stout\nmortal for a loan of orthodoxy. And so did I to our Rector Lougher,\nbrother of the Colonel, a gentleman who had bought my fish, and felt my\nspiritual needs. To him I listened (for well he read), especially a\npsalm to which I could for ever listen, full of noble navigation, deeper\neven than our soundings in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nEvery night we used to wonder where Lieutenant Bluett was, knowing as we\ndid from my descriptions (when the hob was hot) what it is to be at sea\nwith all the rigging freezing. When the blocks are clogged with ice and\nmake mysterious groanings, and the shrouds have grown a beard as cold as\ntheir own name is, and the deck begins to slip; and all the watch with\nropes to handle, spit upon their palms, and strike them (dancing with\ntheir toes the while) one man to another man\'s, hoping to see sparks\ncome out. So it is, I can assure you, who have never been at sea, when\nthe barbs of icy spray by a freezing wind are driven, like a volley of\nlangrel-shot raking the ship from stem to stern, shrivelling blue cheeks\nand red noses, shattering quids from the chattering teeth. Many a time\nin these bitter nights, with the roar of east wind through the\nfir-trees, and the rattle of doors in the snow-drift, I felt ashamed of\nmy cozy berth, and could not hug my comfort, from thinking of my ancient\nmessmates turned to huddled icicles.\n\nBut all was ordained for the best, no doubt: for supposing that I had\nbeen at sea through the year 1795, or even 1796, what single general\naction was there worthy of my presence? It might have been otherwise\nwith me there, and in a leading position. However, even of this I cannot\nby any means be certain, for seamen quite as brave and skilful were\nafloat at that very time. However, beyond a few frigate actions, and\nmatters far away from home, at the Cape, or in the East Indies, I did\nnot hear of anything that I need have longed much to partake in. So that\nI did not repent of accepting a harbour-appointment at Plymouth, which\n(upon my partial recovery) was obtained for me by Sir Philip Bampfylde,\nan old friend of the Port-Admiral there.\n\nFor that good Sir Philip was a little uneasy, after shipping me off last\nautumn, lest he might have behaved with any want of gratitude towards\nme. Of course he had done nothing of the kind; for in truth I had raved\nfor my country so--as I came to learn long afterwards--that when all the\nrisk of infection was over, the doctor from Barnstaple said that my only\nchance of recovering reason lay in the air of my native land. But at any\nrate this kind baronet thought himself bound to come and look after me,\nin the spring of the year when the buds were awake, and the iron was\ngone from the soul of the earth. He had often promised that fine old\ntyrant Anthony Stew to revisit him; so now he resolved to kill two birds\nwith one stone, as the saying is.\n\nI had returned to my cottage now, but being still very frail and stupid,\nin spite of port wine every day, I could not keep the tears from\nstarting, when this good and great landowner bent his silver head\nbeneath my humble lintel, and forbade me in his calm majestic manner to\nthink for a moment of dousing my pipe. And even Justice Stew, who of\ncourse took good care to come after him, did not use an uncivil word,\nwhen he saw what Sir Philip thought of me.\n\n""Sir,"" said the General to the Squire, after shaking hands most\nkindly with me, ""this is a man whom I truly respect. There seems to\nbe but one opinion about him. I call him a noble specimen of your\nfellow-countrymen.""\n\n""Yes, to be sure,"" answered Anthony Stew: ""but my noble\nfellow-countrymen say that I am an Irishman.""\n\n""No doubt whatever about that, your Worship,"" was the proper thing for\nme to reply; but the condition of my head forbade me almost to shake it.\nIf it had pleased the Lord to give me only a dozen holes and\nscars--which could not matter at my time of life--there would not by any\nmeans have arisen, as all the old women of Newton said, this sad\npressure on the brain-pan, and difficulty of coping even with a man of\nAnthony Stew\'s kind. But, alas! instead of opening out, the subtle\nplague struck inwards, leaving not a sign outside, but a delicate\ntransparency.\n\nThis visit from Sir Philip did not end without a queer affair, whereof I\nhad no notice then, being set down by all the village as only fit to\npoke about among the sandhills, and then to die. But no one could take\nthe church-clock from me, till the bell should be tolling for me; and as\na matter of duty I drew some long arrears of salary.\n\nIt seems that Sir Philip drove down one day from Pen Coed to look after\nme, and having done this with his usual kindness, spread word through\nthe children (who throughout our lane abounded) that really none of his\nmoney remained for any more sticks of peppermint. It was high time for\nthem to think, he said, after ever so much education, of earning from\nsevenpence to tenpence a-week, for the good of the babies they carried.\nAll the children gathered round him at this fine idea, really not\nbelieving quite that the purse of such a gentleman could have nothing\nmore to say. And the girls bearing babes were concave in the back, while\nthe boys in the same predicament stuck out clumsily where their spines\nwere setting.\n\n""Drive me away,"" said Sir Philip to the groom; ""drive me straight away\nanywhere: these Welsh children are so clever, I shall have no chance\nwith them.""\n\n""Indeed, your Honour, they is,"" said the groom with a grin, as behoved a\nWelshman. ""Would your Honour like to go down by the sea, and see our\nbeautiful water-rocks, and our old annshent places?""\n\n""To be sure,"" said Sir Philip; ""the very thing. We have four hours\' time\nto dinner yet; and I fear I have worn out poor Llewellyn. Now follow the\ncoast-line if you are sure that your master would like it, Lewis, with\nthis young horse, and our weight behind.""\n\n""Your Honour, nothing ever comes amiss to this young horse here. \'Tis\ntire I should like to see him, for a change, as we do say. And master do\nalways tell me keep salt-water on his legs whenever.""\n\n""Right!"" cried Sir Philip, who loved the spree, being as full of spirits\nstill, when the air took his trouble out of him, as the young horse in\nthe shafts was.\n\nSo they drove away over the sands towards Sker, which it is easy enough\nto do with a good strong horse and a light car behind him. And by this\ntime the neighbourhood had quite forgotten all its dread of sand-storms.\nIn about half an hour they found themselves in a pretty place of grass\nand furze known as the Lock\'s Common, which faces the sea over some low\ncliffs, and at the western end coves down to it. This is some half a\nmile from Sker House, and a ragged dry wall makes the parish boundary,\nsevering it from Sker-land.\n\n""Drive on,"" cried Sir Philip; ""I enjoy all this: I call this really\nbeautiful, and this fine sward reminds me of Devonshire. But they ought\nto plant some trees here.""\n\nThe driver replied that there was some danger in driving through Sker\nwarren, unless one knew the ground thoroughly, on account of the number\nof rabbit-holes; and the baronet, with that true regard which a\ngentleman feels for the horse of a friend, cancelled his order\nimmediately. ""But,"" he continued, ""I am so thirsty that I scarcely know\nwhat to do. My friend Llewellyn\'s hospitality is so overpowering. The\ntaste of rum is almost unknown to me; but I could not refuse when he\npressed me so. It has made me confoundedly thirsty, Lewis.""\n\n""Your honour,"" said Lewis, ""just round that corner, in a little break of\nthe rocks, there is one of the finest springs in Glamorgan, \'Ffynnon\nWen\' we call it, the water does be sparkling so.""\n\nThe groom, having no cup to fetch the water, stood by the horse in the\nlittle pant or combe; while old Sir Philip went down to the shore, to\ndrink as our first forefather drank, and Gideon\'s men in the Bible.\nWhether he lapped or dipped, I know not (probably the latter, at his\ntime of life), anyhow he assuaged his thirst--which rum of my quality\ncould not have caused in a really sound constitution, after taking no\nmore than a thimbleful--and then for a moment he sate on a rock, soothed\nby the purling water, to rest and to look around him. The place has no\ngreat beauty, as of a sea-side spring in Devonshire, but more of cheer\nand life about it than their ferny grottoes. The bright water breaks\nfrom an elbow of rock, in many veins all uniting, and without any cliff\nabove them; and then, after rushing a very few yards through set stone\nand loose shingle, loses its self-will upon the soft sand, and spreads a\nway over a hundred yards of vague wetness and shallow shining.\n\nThe mild sun of April was glancing on this, and the tide just advancing\nto see to it, when the shadow of a slim figure fell on the stones before\nSir Philip. So quietly had she slipped along, and appeared from the\nrocks so suddenly, that neither old man nor young maiden thought of the\nother until their eyes met.\n\n""What, why, who?"" cried the General, with something as much like a\nstart as good conscience and long service had left in him: ""who are you?\nWho are you, my dear?""\n\nFor his eyes were fixed on a fair young damsel of some fifteen summers,\nstanding upright, with a pad on her head, and on the pad a red pitcher.\nOver her shoulders, and down to her waist, fell dark-brown curls\nabundantly, full of gleaming gold where the sun stole through the rocks\nto dwell in them. Her dress was nothing but blue Welsh flannel, gathered\nat the waist and tucked in front, and her beautifully tinted legs and\nazure-veined feet shone under it.\n\n""Who are you, my pretty creature?"" Sir Philip Bampfylde asked again,\nwhile she opened her grey eyes wide at him.\n\n""Y Ferch o\'r Scer, Syr,"" she answered shyly, and with the strong\nguttural tone which she knew was unpleasant to English ears. For it was\nher sensitive point that she could not tell any one who she was; and her\npride (which was manifold) always led her to draw back from questions.\n\nOn the other hand the old man\'s gaze of strong surprise and deep\ninterest faded into mere admiration at the sound of our fine language.\n\n""Fair young Cambrian, I have asked you rudely, and you are displeased\nwith me. Lift your curls, my little dear, and let me see your face a\nwhile. I remember one just like it. There, you are put out again! So it\nwas with the one I mean when anything happened hastily.""\n\nThe beautiful girl flung back her hair, and knelt to stoop her pitcher\nin the gurgling runnel; and then she looked at his silver locks, and was\nsorry for her impatience.\n\n""Sir, I beg you to forgive me, if I have been rude to you. I am the maid\nfrom the old house yonder. I am often sent for this water, because it\nsparkles much more than our own does. If you please, I must go home,\nsir.""\n\nShe filled the red pitcher, and tucked the blue skirt, as girls alone\ncan manage it; and Sir Philip Bampfylde sighed at thinking of his age\nand loneliness, while with an old-fashioned gentleman\'s grace he lifted\nthe pitcher and asked no more upon whose head he laid it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nMORE HASTE, LESS SPEED.\n\n\nTo do what is thoroughly becoming and graceful is my main desire. That\nany man should praise himself, and insist upon his own exploits and\nservices to his native land, or even should let people guess at his\nvalour, by any manner of side-wind,--such a course would simply deprive\nme of the only thing a poor battered sailor has left to support him\nagainst his pension; I mean of course humble, but nevertheless\nwell-grounded, self-respect.\n\nThis delicacy alone forbids me even to allude to that urgent and\nuniversal call for my very humble services which launched me on the\nbriny waves once more, and in time for a share in the glorious battle\nfought off Cape St Vincent. Upon that great St Valentine\'s Day of 1797 I\nwas Master of the Excellent, under Captain Collingwood; and every boy in\nthe parish knows how we captured the Saint Isidore, and really took the\nSaint Nicholas, though other people got the credit, and nearly took a\nfour-decked ship of 130 guns, whose name was the Saint Miss Trinder, and\nwho managed to sneak away, when by all rights we had got her.\n\nHowever, let us be content with things beyond contradiction; the\nforemost of which is, that no ship ever was carried into action in a\nmore masterly style than the Excellent upon that occasion. And the\nweight of this falls on the Master, far more than the Captain, I do\nassure you. So highly were my skill and coolness commended in the\ndespatches, that if I could have borne to be reduced below inferior men,\nI might have died a real Captain in the British Navy. For (as happened\nto the now Captain Bowen, when Master of the Queen Charlotte) I was\noffered a lieutenant\'s commission, and doubted about accepting it. Had I\nbeen twenty years younger, of course, I must have jumped at the offer;\nbut at my time of life, and with all my knowledge, it would have been\ntoo painful to be ordered about by some young dancer; therefore I\ndeclined; at the same time thinking it fair to suggest, for the sake of\nthe many true Britons now dependent upon me, that a small pecuniary\nremittance would meet with my consideration. That faculty of mine,\nhowever, was not called to the encounter: I never heard more about it,\nand had to be satisfied with glory.\n\nBut if a man is undervalued often, and puts up with it, he generally\nfinds that fortune treats him with respect in other more serious\naspects. For instance, what would have happened if Providence had\nordained to send me into either of those sad mutinies which disgraced\nour fleets so terribly? That deep respect for authority which (like the\nyolk of a nest-egg) lies calmly inside me, waiting to be sate upon; as\nwell as my inborn sense of Nature\'s resistless determination to end by\nturning me into a gentleman (indications of which must have long ago\nbeen perceived by every reader), not to mention any common sense of duty\nin the abstract and wages in the pocket,--these considerations must have\nled me to lay a pistol to the head of almost every man I could find.\n\nHowever, from such a course of action grace and mercy preserved me: and\nperhaps it was quite as well. For I am not sure that I could have\nstopped any one of the four mutinies entirely; although I can answer for\nit, that never would bad manners take the lead in any ship, while I was\nMaster. It is the shilly-shallying that produces all the mischief. If\nall our Captains had behaved like Captain Peard and his first\nlieutenant, in the St George off Cadiz, at the first spread of\ndisaffection, it is my opinion that a great disgrace and danger would\nhave been crushed in the bud. But what could be expected when our\nGovernment showed the like weakness? Twice they went hankering after\npeace, and even sent ambassadors! Who can ram shot home with pleasure\nwhile things of this kind are encouraged? To fight it out is the true\nChristianity, ordered by the Church itself.\n\nAnd this we did, and are doing still, as Roger Berkrolles prophesied;\nand the only regret I have about it is, that a stiffness in my knees\nenables the other boarders to take a mean advantage of their youth, and\njump into the chains or port-holes of a ship (when by my tactics\nconquered), so as to get a false lead of me. However, no small\nconsolation was to be gained by reflecting how much more prize-money\nwould accrue to me than to any of these forward fellows, so that one\nmight with an unmoved leg contemplate their precipitancy.\n\nEven a sorer grievance was the breaking up and dispersion of our noble\nand gallant ship\'s company, so long accustomed to one another and to\nsharp discipline in the Defence. Where was Captain Bampfylde? Where was\nLieutenant Rodney Bluett? What was become of our three fine savages?\nEven Heaviside and Hezekiah were in my thoughts continually, and out of\nmy knowledge entirely. As to the latter worthy gunsmith, ""Artillerist\nto the King and Queen, and all the Royal Family,"" I can only at present\nsay that when I had been last at home, and before my acceptance of that\nbrief appointment in the Plymouth dockyard--in short, when first I\nrecovered strength, after that long illness, to cope with the walk both\nto and fro--I found occasion to go to Bridgend, with my uniform on for\nthe sake of the town. I had not turned the corner of the bridge a good\nhalf-hour, before that important fact was known from the riverbank to\nthe churchyard. And Griffith of the ""Cat and Snuffers,"" set up such a\nWelsh hurrah [as good as the screech of a wild-cat trapped] that it went\nup the hill to Newcastle. In a word, Hepzibah heard of me, and ran down\nthe hill, like a roaring lion, demanding her Hezekiah!\n\nWhat ensued is painful to me even now to speak of. For though my\nconscience was refitting, and ready to knock about again, after carrying\ntoo much sail, I could not find it in my heart to give the mother of a\nrapid family nothing but lies to feed upon. Many men of noble nature\ndwell upon nothing but conscience; as if that were the one true compass\nfor a man to steer by--whereas I never did find a man--outside my own\nSunday clothes,--whose conscience would not back him up in whatever he\nhad a mind for.\n\nMy own had always worked like a power plainly exposed to every one;\nthereby gaining strength and revolving as fast as a mountain windmill,\nwhen the corn is falling away to chaff. This, however, was not required\nin the present instance; for Hepzibah (like a good woman) fell from one\nextreme into the opposite. From bitter reviling to praise and gratitude\nwas but a turn of the tongue to her; especially when I happened to\nwhisper into the ear of Griffith that the whole of my stipend for Newton\nChurch clock would now, according to my views of justice, be handed to\nHezekiah\'s wife, inasmuch as the worthy gunsmith had rejoined the Church\nof England. And I said what a dreadful blow this would be to all the\nNicodemites, when the gun-officer returned with money enough to build a\nchapel: however, I felt that it served them right, because they had\nlately begun to sneer at his good wife\'s wonderful prophecies.\n\nIn a word, I had promised to find Hezekiah; and, both while in harbour\nand now when afloat, I tried to get tidings not only of him, but also of\nthe Newton tailor, and Heaviside, and the three wild men, as well as\nyoung Harry Savage, Lieutenant Bluett, and Captain Bampfylde. For all of\nthese being at sea and in war-time, who could say what had befallen\nthem? Whereas I knew all about most of our people now living ashore in\nthe middle of peace. However, of course one must expect old shipmates to\nbe parted; and with all the vast force now afloat under the British\nflag, it would almost be a wonder if any of us should haul our wind\nwithin hailing distance of the others during our cruise in this world.\n\nNevertheless it did so happen, as I plainly will set forth, so far as I\nremember. Through the rest of the year \'97 and the early part of the\nfollowing year I was knocking about off and on near the Straits, being\nappointed to another ship while the Excellent was refitting, and\nafterwards to the Goliath, a fine 74, under Captain Foley.\n\nIn the month of May 1798, all our Mediterranean fleet, except three\nships of the line, lay blockading Cadiz. Our Admiral, the Earl St\nVincent, formerly Sir John Jervis, had orders also to watch Toulon,\nwhere a great fleet was assembling. And our information was so scant and\ncontradictory, that our Admiral sent but three ships of the line and a\nfrigate or two to see what those crafty Frenchmen might be up to. But\nthis searching squadron had a commander whose name was Horatio Nelson.\n\nThis was not by any means the man to let frog-eaters do exactly as they\npleased with us. ""I believe in the King of England; I have faith in\ndiscipline; I abhor all Frenchmen worse than the very devil."" Such was\nhis creed; and at any moment he would give his life for it. It is\nsomething for a man to know what he means, and be able to put it\nclearly; and this alone fetches to his side more than half of the\narguers who cannot make their minds up. But it is a much rarer gift, and\nnot often combined with the other, for a man to enter into, and be able\nto follow up, ways and turns, and ins and outs, of the natures of all\nother men. If this is done by practised subtlety, it arouses hatred, and\ncan get no further. But if it be a gift of nature exercised unwittingly,\nand with kind love of manliness, all who are worth bringing over are\nbrought over by it.\n\nIf it were not hence, I know not whence it was that Nelson had such\npower over every man of us. To know what he meant, to pronounce it, and\nto perceive what others meant, these three powers enabled him to make\nall the rest mean what he did. At any rate such is my opinion; although\nI would not fly in the face of better scholars than myself, who\ndeclared that here was witchcraft. What else could account for the\nmanner in which all Nelson\'s equals in rank at once acknowledged him as\nthe foremost, and felt no jealousy towards him? Even Admiral Earl St\nVincent, great commander as he was, is said to have often deferred to\nthe judgment of the younger officer. As for the men, they all looked\nupon it as worth a gold watch to sail under him.\n\nTherefore we officers of the inshore squadron, under Captain Troubridge,\ncould scarcely keep our crews from the most tremendous and uproarious\ncheers when we got orders to make sail for the Mediterranean, and place\nourselves under the command of Nelson. We could not allow any cheering,\nbecause the Dons ashore were not to know a word about our departure,\nlest they should inform the Crappos, under whose orders they now were\nacting. And a British cheer has such a ring over the waters of the sea,\nand leaps from wave to wave so, that I have heard it a league away when\nroused up well to windward. So our fine fellows had leave to cheer to\ntheir hearts\' content when we got our offing; and partly under my\nconduct (for I led the way in the Goliath), nine seventy-fours got away\nto sea in the night of the 24th of May, and nine liners from England\nreplaced them, without a single Jack Spaniard ever suspecting any\nmovement. Every one knows what a time we had of it, after joining our\nAdmiral; how we dashed away helter-skelter, from one end of the world to\nthe other almost, in a thorough wild-goose chase, because the Board of\nAdmiralty, with their usual management, sent thirteen ships of the line\nespecially on a searching scurry without one frigate to scout for them!\nWe were obliged to sail, of course, within signalling distance of each\nother, and so that line of battle might be formed without delay, upon\nappearance of the enemy. For we now had a man whose signal was ""Go at\n\'em when you see \'em."" Also, as always comes to pass when the sons of\nBeelzebub are abroad, a thick haze lay both day and night upon the face\nof the water. So that, while sailing in close order, upon the night of\nthe shortest day, we are said to have crossed the wake of the Frenchmen,\nalmost ere it grew white again, without even sniffing their roasted\nfrogs. Possibly this is true, in spite of all the great Nelson\'s\nvigilance; for I went to my hammock quite early that night, having\nsuffered much from a hollow eye-tooth ever since I lost sight of poor\nPolly.\n\nAdmiral Nelson made no mistake. He had in the highest degree what is\ncalled in human nature ""genius,"" and in dogs and horses ""instinct.""\nThat is to say, he knew how to sniff out the road to almost anything.\nTrusting to this tenfold (when he found that our Government would not\nhear of it, but was nearly certain of a mighty landing upon Ireland),\noff he set for Egypt, carrying on with every blessed sail that would or\neven would not draw. We came to that coast at a racing speed, and you\nshould have seen his vexation when there was no French ship in the\nroadstead. ""I have made a false cast, Troubridge,"" he cried; ""I shall\nwrite to be superseded. My want of judgment may prove fatal to my King\nand country.""\n\nFor our Government had sent him word, through the Earl St Vincent, that\nthe great expedition from Toulon would sail for England or Ireland; and\nhe at his peril had taken upon him to reject such nonsense. But now (as\nhappens by Nature\'s justice to all very sanguine men) he was ready to\nsmite the breast that had suggested pure truth to him. Thus being\nbaffled we made all sail, and after a chase of six hundred leagues, and\ncontinually beating to windward, were forced to bear up on St Swithin\'s\nDay and make for the coast of Sicily. And it shows the value of good old\nhands, and thoroughly sound experience, that I, the oldest man perhaps\nin the fleet, could alone guide the fleet into Syracuse. Here our fierce\nexcitement bubbled while we took in water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nIN A ROCKY BOWER.\n\n\nI never hear of a man\'s impatience without sagely reflecting upon the\nrapid flight of time, when age draws on, and business thickens, and all\nthe glory of this world must soon be left behind us. From the date of my\ngreat catch of fish and landing of Bardie at Pool Tavan, to the day of\nmy guiding the British fleet betwixt the shoals of Syracuse, more than\nsixteen years had passed, and scarce left time to count them.\n\nTherefore it was but a natural thing that the two little maidens with\nwhom I began should now be grown up, and creating a stir in the minds of\nyoung men of the neighbourhood. Early in this present month of July,\nthat north-west breeze, which was baffling our fleet off the coast of\nAnatolia, was playing among the rocks of Sker with the curls and skirts\nand ribbons of these two fair young damsels.\n\nOr rather with the ribbons of one, for Bunny alone wore streamers,\nwherein her heart delighted; while the maid of Sker was dressed as\nplainly as if she had been her servant. Not that her inborn love of\nbrightness ever had abandoned her, but that her vanities were put down\nquite arrogantly by Master Berkrolles whenever she came back from\nCandleston; and but for her lessons in music there--which were beyond\nRoger\'s compass--he would have raised his voice against her visits to\nthe good Colonel.\n\nFor the old man\'s heart was entirely fixed upon the graceful maiden, and\nhis chief anxiety was to keep her out of the way of harm. He knew that\nthe Colonel loved nothing better (as behoved his lineage) than true and\nfree hospitality; and he feared that the simple and nameless girl might\nset her affections on some grand guest, who would scorn her derelict\norigin.\n\nNow she led Bunny into a cave, or rather a snug little cove of rock,\nwhich she always called her cradle, and where she had spent many lonely\nhours, in singing pure Welsh melodies of the sweetest sadness, feeling a\nlove of the desert places from her own desertion. Then down she sate in\nher chair of stone, with limpets and barnacles studding it; while Bunny\nin the established manner bounced down on a pebble and gazed at her.\n\nMy son\'s daughter was a solid girl, very well built as our family is,\nand raking most handsomely fore and aft. Her fine black eyes, and\nabiding colour, and the modesty inherited from her grandfather, and some\nreflection perhaps of his fame, made her a favourite everywhere. And any\ngrandfather might well have been proud to see how she carried her dress\noff.\n\nThe younger maid sate right above her, quite as if Nature had ordered it\nso; and drew her skirt of home-spun camlet over her dainty feet, because\nthe place was wet and chilly. And anybody looking must have said that\nshe was born to grace. The clear outlines of oval face and delicate\nstrength of forehead were moulded as by Nature only can such dainty work\nbe done. Gentle pride and quiet moods of lonely meditation had deepened\nand subdued the radiance of the large grey eyes, and changed the dancing\nmirth of childhood into soft intelligence. And it must have been a fine\naffair, with the sunshine glancing on the breezy sea, to take a look at\nthe lights and shadows of so clear a countenance.\n\nBunny, like a frigate riding, doused her head and all her outworks\nforward of the bends; and then hung fluttering and doubtful, just as if\nshe had missed stays.\n\n""It is not your engagement, my dear Bunny,"" began Delushy, as if she\nwere ten years the senior officer; ""you must not suppose for a moment\nthat I object to your engagement. It is time, of course, for you to\nthink, among so many suitors, of some one to put up with, especially\nafter what you told me about having toothache. And Watkin is thoroughly\ngood and kind, and able to read quite respectably. But what I blame you\nfor is this, that you have not been straightforward, Bunny. Why have you\nkept me in the dark about this one of your many \'sweetheartings,\' as you\nalways call them?""\n\n""And for sure, miss, then I never did no such thing; unless it was that\nI thought you was wanting him.""\n\n""I! You surely cannot have thought it! I want Watkin Thomas!""\n\n""Well, miss, you need not fly out like that. All the girls in Newton was\nafter him. And if it wasn\'t you as wanted him, it might be him as wanted\nyou, which comes to the same thing always.""\n\n""I don\'t quite think that it does, dear Bunny, though you may have made\nit do so. Now look up and kiss me, dear: you know that I love you very\nmuch, though I have a way of saying things. And then I am longing to beg\npardon when I have vexed any one. It comes of my \'noble birth,\' I\nsuppose, which the girls of Newton laugh about. How I wish that I were\nbut the child of the poorest good man in the parish! But now I am tired\nof thinking of it. What good ever comes of it? And what can one poor\natom matter?""\n\n""You are not a poor atom; you are the best, and the cleverest, and most\nlearnedest, and most beautifullest lady as ever was seen in the whole of\nthe land.""\n\nAfter or rather in the middle of which words, our Bunny, with her usual\nvigour and true national ardour, leaped into the arms of Delushy, so\nthat they had a good cry together. ""You will wait, of course, for your\nGranny to come, before you settle anything.""\n\n""Will I, indeed?"" cried that wicked Bunny, and lucky for her that I was\nnot there: ""I shall do nothing of the sort. If he chooses to be always\naway at sea, conquering the French for ever, and never coming home when\nhe can help it, he must make up his mind to be surprised when he happens\nto come home again. For sure then, that is right enough.""\n\n""Well, it does seem almost reasonable,"" answered the young lady: ""and I\nthink sometimes that we have no right to expect so much as that of\nthings. It is not what they often do; and so they lose the habit of it.""\n\n""I do not quite understand,"" said Bunny.\n\n""And I don\'t half understand,"" said Bardie:--""but--oh my dear, what\nshall I do? He is coming this way, I am sure. And I would not have you\nknow anything of it--and of course you must feel that it is all\nnonsense. And I did not mean any harm about \'courting;\' only you ought\nto be out of the way, and yet at the same time in it.""\n\nOur Bunny was such a slow-witted girl, and at the same time so\nparticular (inheriting slowness from her good mother, and conscience\nfrom third generation), that really she could make no hand at meeting\nsuch a crisis. For now she began to perceive gold-lace, which alone\ndiscomfits the woman-race, and sets their minds going upon what they\nlove. And so she did very little else but stare.\n\n""I did think you would have helped me, Bunny,"" Delushy cried, with\naggrievement. ""I wanted to hear your own affairs, of course; but I would\nnot have brought you here----""\n\n""Young ladies, well met!"" cried as solid a voice as the chops of the\nChannel had ever tautened: ""I knew that you were here, and so I came\ndown to look after you.""\n\n""Sure then, sir, and I do think that it is very kind of you. We was just\nawanting looking after. Oh what a fish I do see in that pool! Please\nonly you now both to keep back. I shall be back again, now just, sir.""\nWith these words away flew Bunny, as if her life were set on it.\n\n""What a fine creature, to be sure!"" said Commander Bluett, thoughtfully;\n""she reminds me so much of her grandfather. There is something so\nstrongly alike between them, in their reckless outspoken honour, as well\nas in the turn of the nose they have.""\n\n""Let us follow, and admire her a little more,"" cried Delushy: ""she\ndeserves it, as you say; and perhaps--well perhaps she likes it.""\n\nYoung Rodney looked at her a little while, and then at the ground a\nlittle while; because he was a stupid fellow as concerns young women. He\nthought this one such a perfect wonder, as may well be said of all of\nthem. Then those two fenced about a little, out of shot of each other\'s\neyes.\n\nThere was no doubt between them as to the meaning of each other. But\nthey both seemed to think it wise to have a little bit of vexing before\ndoing any more. And thus they looked at one another as if there was\nnothing between them. And all the time, how they were longing!\n\n""I must have yes or no:"" for Rodney could not outlast the young lady:\n""yes or no; you know what I mean. I am almost always at sea; and\nto-morrow I start to join Nelson. With him there is no play-work. I hope\nto satisfy him, though I know what he is to satisfy. But I hope to do\nit.""\n\n""Of course you will,"" Delushy answered. ""You seem to give great\nsatisfaction; almost everywhere, I am sure.""\n\n""Do I give it, you proud creature, where I long to give it most?""\n\n""How can I pretend to say, without being told in what latitude even--as\nI think your expression is--this amiable desire lies?""\n\n""As if you did not know, Delushy!""\n\n""As if I did know, Captain Bluett! And another thing--I am not to be\ncalled \'Delushy,\' much, in that way.""\n\n""Very well, then; much in another way. Delushy, Delushy, delicious\nDelushy, what makes you so unkind to me? To-morrow I go away, and\nperhaps we shall never meet again, Delushy: and then how you would\nreproach yourself. Don\'t you think you would now?""\n\n""When never and then come together--yes. I suppose all sailors talk so.""\n\n""If I cannot even talk to please you, there is nothing more to say. I\nthink that the bards have turned your head with their harpings, and\ntheir fiddle-strings, and ballads (in very bad Welsh, no doubt) about\n\'the charming maid of Sker;\' and so on. When you are old enough to know\nbetter, and the young conceit wears out of you, you may be sorry, Miss\nAndalusia, for your wonderful cleverness.""\n\nHe made her a bow with his handsome hat, and her warm young heart was\nchilled by it. Surely he ought to have shaken hands. She tried to keep\nher own meaning at home, and bid him farewell with a curtsy, while he\ntried not to look back again; but fortune or nature was too much for\nthem, and their eyes met wistfully.\n\nThese things are out of my line so much, that I cannot pretend to say\nnow for a moment what these very young people did; and everybody else\nhaving done the same, with more or less unwisdom, according to\nconstitution, may admire the power of charity which restrains me from\ndescribing them. My favourite writer of Scripture is St Paul, who was\nafraid of nobody, and who spent his time in making sails when the thorn\nin the flesh permitted him. And this great writer describes the quick\nmanners of maidens far better than I can. Wherefore I keep myself up\naloft until they have had a good spell of it.\n\n""I have no opinion, now. What can you expect of me? Rodney, I must stop\nand think for nearly a quarter of a century before I have an opinion.""\n\n""Then stay, just so; and let me admire you, till I have to swim with\nyou.""\n\n""Rodney, you are reckless. Here comes the tide; and you know I have got\nmy very best Candleston side-lace boots on!""\n\n""Then come out of this rocky bower, which suits your fate so, darling;\nand let us talk most sensibly.""\n\n""By all means; if you think we can. There, you need not touch me,\nRodney;--I can get out very well indeed. I know these rocks better than\nyou do perhaps. Now sit on this rock where old David first hooked me, as\nI have heard that old chatterbox tell fifty times, as if he had done\nsome great great thing.""\n\n""He did indeed a grand grand thing. No wonder that he is proud of it.\nAnd he has so much to be proud of that you may take it for your highest\ncompliment. Perhaps there is no other man in the service--or I might say\nin all the civilised world----"" But it hurts me to tell what this\nexcellent officer said or even thought of me. He was such a first-rate\njudge by this time that I must leave his opinion blank.\n\nOver the sea they began to look, in a discontented quietude; as the\nmanner of young mortals is before they begin to know better, and with\ngreat ideas moving them. Bunny, with the very kindest discretion, had\nrun away entirely, and might now be seen at the far end of the sands,\nand springing up the rocks, on her way to Newton. So those two sate side\nby side, with their hearts full of one another, and their minds made up\nto face the world together, whatever might come of it. For as yet they\ncould see nothing clearly through the warm haze of loving, being wrapped\nup in an atmosphere which generally leads to a hurricane. But to them,\nfor a few short minutes, earth and sea and sky were all one universal\nheaven.\n\n""It will not do,"" cried the maid of Sker, suddenly awaking with a short\ndeep sigh, and drawing back her delicate hand from the broad palm of\nyoung Rodney: ""it will never, never do. We must both be mad to think of\nit.""\n\n""Who could fail to be mad,"" he answered, ""if you set the example?""\n\n""Now, don\'t be so dreadfully stupid, Rodney. What I say is most serious.\nOf course you know the world better than I do, as you told me yesterday,\nafter sailing a dozen times round it. But I am thinking of other things.\nNot of what the world will say, but of what I myself must feel. And the\nfirst of these things is that I cannot be cruelly ungrateful. It would\nbe the deepest ingratitude to the Colonel if I went on with it.""\n\n""Went on with it! What a way to speak! As if you could be off with it\nwhen you pleased! And my good uncle loves you like his own daughter; and\nso does my mother. Now what can you mean?""\n\n""As if you did not know indeed! Now, Rodney, do talk sensibly. I ought\nto know, if any one does, what your uncle and your mother are. And I\nknow that they would rather see your death in the Gazette than your\nmarriage with an unknown, nameless nobody like me, sir.""\n\n""Well, of course, we must take the chance of that,"" said Captain Bluett,\ncarelessly. ""The Colonel is the best soul in the world, and my dear\nmother a most excellent creature, whenever she listens to reason. But as\nto my asking their permission--it is the last thing I should dream of. I\nam old enough to know my own mind, and to get my own living, I should\nhope, as well as that of my family. And if I am only in time with\nNelson, of course we shall do wonders.""\n\nFor a minute or two the poor young maid had not a word to say to him.\nShe longed to throw her arms around him, when he spoke so proudly, and\nto indulge her own pride in him, as against all the world beside. But\nhaving been brought up in so much trouble, she had learned to check\nherself. So that she did nothing more than wait for him to go on again.\nAnd this he did with sparkling eyes and the confidence of a young\nBritish tar.\n\n""There is another thing, my beauty, which they are bound to consider, as\nwell as all the prize-money I shall earn. And that is, that they have\nnobody except themselves to thank for it. They must have known what was\nsure to happen, if they chose to have you there whenever I was home from\nsea. And my mother is so clever too--to my mind it is plain enough that\nthey meant me to do what I have done.""\n\n""And pray what is that?""\n\n""As if you did not know! Come now, you must pay the penalty of asking\nfor a compliment. Talk about breeding and good birth, and that stuff!\nWhy, look at your hands and then look at mine. Put your fingers between\nmine--both hands, both hands--that\'s the way. Now just feel my great\nclumsy things, and then see how lovely yours are--as clear as\nwax-tapers, and just touched with rose, and every nail with a fairy\ngift, and pointed like an almond. A \'nameless nobody\' indeed! What\nnameless nobody ever had such nails? By way of contrast examine mine.""\n\n""Oh but you bite yours shockingly, Rodney. I am sure that you do, though\nI never saw you. You must be cured of that dreadful trick.""\n\n""That shall be your first job, Delushy, when you are Mrs Rodney. Now for\nanother great sign of birth. Do you see any peak to my upper lip?""\n\n""No, I can\'t say I do. But how foolish you are! I ought to be crying,\nand you make me laugh.""\n\n""Then just let me show you the peak to yours. Honour bright--and no mean\nadvantages--that is to say if I can help it. Oh, here\'s that blessed\nMoxy coming! May the Frenchmen rob her hen-roost! Now just one promise,\ndarling, darling; just one little promise. To-morrow I go to most\ndesperate battles, and lucky to come home with one arm and one leg.\nTherefore, promise a solemn promise to have no one in the world but me.""\n\n""I think,"" said the maid, with her lips to his ear, in the true old\ncoaxing fashion, ""that I may very well promise that. But I will promise\nanother thing too. And that is, not to have even you, until your dear\nmother and good uncle come to me and ask me. And that can never never\nbe.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nNELSON AND THE NILE.\n\n\nThe first day of August in the year of our Lord 1798 is a day to be long\nremembered by every Briton with a piece of constitution in him. For on\nthat day our glorious navy, under the immortal Nelson, administered to\nthe Frenchmen, under Admiral Brewer, as pure and perfect a lathering as\nis to be found in all history. This I never should venture to put upon\nmy own authority (especially after the prominent part assigned therein\nby Providence to a humble individual who came from Newton-Nottage), for\nwith history I have no patience at all, because it always contradicts\nthe very things I have seen and known: but I am bound to believe a man\nof such high principles and deep reading as Master Roger Berkrolles. And\nhe tells me that I have helped to produce the greatest of all great\nvictories.\n\nBe that one way or the other, I can tell you every word concerning how\nwe managed it; and you need not for one moment think me capable of\nprejudice. Quite the contrary, I assure you. There could not have been\nin the British fleet any man more determined to do justice to all\nCrappos, than a thoroughly ancient navigator, now master of the Goliath.\n\nWe knew exactly what to do, every Captain, every Master, every\nquarter-master; even the powder-monkeys had their proper work laid out\nfor them. The spirit of Nelson ran through us all; and our hearts caught\nfire from his heart. From the moment of our first glimpse at the\nFrenchmen spread out in that tempting manner, beautifully moored and\nriding in a long fine head and stern, every old seaman among us began to\ncount on his fingers prize-money. They thought that we would not fight\nthat night, for the sun was low when we found them; and with their\nperpetual conceit, they were hard at work taking water in. I shall never\nforget how beautiful these ships looked, and how peaceful. A French ship\nalways sits the water with an elegant quickness, like a Frenchwoman at\nthe looking-glass. And though we brought the evening breeze in very\nbriskly with us, there was hardly swell enough in the bay to make them\nplay their hawsers. Many fine things have I seen, and therefore know\npretty well how to look at them, which a man never can do upon the\nfirst or even the second occasion. But it was worth any man\'s while to\nlive to the age of threescore years and eight, with a sound mind in a\nsound body, and eyes almost as good as ever, if there were nothing for\nit more than to see what I saw at this moment. Six-and-twenty ships of\nthe line, thirteen bearing the tricolor, and riding cleared for action,\nthe other thirteen with the red cross flying, the cross of St George on\nthe ground of white, and tossing the blue water from their stems under\npressure of canvass. Onward rushed our British ships, as if every one of\nthem was alive, and driven out of all patience by the wicked escapes of\nthe enemy. Twelve hundred leagues of chase had they cost us, ingratitude\ntowards God every night, and love of the devil at morning, with dread of\nour country for ever prevailing, and mistrust of our own good selves.\nAnd now at last we had got them tight; and mean we did to keep them.\nCaptain Foley came up to me as I stood on the ratlines to hear the\nreport of the men in the starboard fore-chains; and his fine open face\nwas clouded. ""Master,"" he said, ""how much more of this? Damn your\nsoundings. Can\'t you see that the Zealous is drawing ahead of us? Hood\nhas nobody in the chains. If you can\'t take the ship into action, I\nwill. Stand by there to set top-gallant-sails.""\n\nThese had been taken in, scarce five minutes agone, as prudence\ndemanded, for none of us had any chart of the bay; and even I knew\nlittle about it, except that there was a great shoal of rock betwixt\nAboukir island and the van ship of the enemy. And but for my warning, we\nmight have followed the two French brigs appointed to decoy us in that\ndirection. Now, having filled top-gallant-sails, we rapidly headed our\nrival the Zealous, in spite of all that she could do; and we had the\nhonour of receiving the first shot of the enemy. For now we were rushing\nin, stern on, having formed line of battle, towards the van of the\nanchored Frenchmen.\n\nNow as to what followed, and the brilliant idea which occurred to\nsomebody to turn the enemy\'s line and take them on the larboard or inner\nside (on which they were quite unprepared for attack), no two\nauthorities are quite agreed, simply because they all are wrong. Some\nattribute this grand manÅ\x93uvre to our great Admiral Nelson, others to\nCaptain Hood of the Zealous, and others to our Captain Foley. This\nlatter is nearest the mark; but from whom did Captain Foley obtain the\nhint? Modesty forbids me to say what Welshman it was who devised this\nnoble and most decisive stratagem, while patriotic duty compels me to\nsay that it was a Welshman, and more than that a Glamorganshire man,\nborn in a favoured part of the quiet village of N--N--. Enough, unless I\nadd that internal evidence will convince any unprejudiced person that\nnone but an ancient fisherman, and thorough-going long-shore-man, could\nby any possibility have smelled out his way so cleverly.\n\nOur great Admiral saw, with his usual insight into Frenchmen, that if\nthey remained at anchor we were sure to man their capstans. For Crappos\nfight well enough with a rush, but unsteadily when at a standstill, and\nworst of all when taken by surprise and outmanÅ\x93uvred. And the manner in\nwhich the British fleet advanced was enough to strike them cold by its\nmajesty and its awfulness. For in perfect silence we were gliding over\nthe dark-blue sea, with the stately height of the white sails shining,\nand the sky behind us full of solemn yellow sunset. Even we, so sure of\nconquest, and so nerved with stern delight, could not gaze on the things\naround us, and the work before us, without for a moment wondering\nwhether the Lord in heaven looked down at us.\n\nAt any rate we obeyed to the letter the orders both of our Admiral and\nof a man scarcely less remarkable. ""Let not the sun go down on your\nwrath,"" are the very words of St Paul, I believe; and we never fired a\nshot until there was no sun left to look at it. I stood by the men at\nthe wheel myself, and laid my own hand to it: for it was a matter of\nvery fine steerage, to run in ahead of the French line, ware soundings,\nand then bear up on their larboard bow, to deliver a thorough good\nraking broadside. I remember looking over my left shoulder after we bore\nup our helm a-weather, while crossing the bows of the Carrier (as the\nforemost enemy\'s ship was called), and there was the last limb of the\nsun like the hoof of a horse disappearing. And my own head nearly went\nwith it, as the wind of a round-shot knocked me over. ""Bear up, bear up,\nlads,"" cried Captain Foley, ""our time has come at last, my boys! Well\ndone Llewellyn! A finer sample of conning and steerage was never seen.\nLet go the best bower. Pass the word. Ready at quarters all of you. Now\nshe bears clear fore and aft. Damn their eyes, let them have it.""\n\nOut rang the whole of our larboard battery, almost like a single gun; a\nfiner thing was never seen; and before the ring passed into a roar, the\nyell of Frenchmen came through the smoke. Masts and spars flew right\nand left with the bones of men among them, and the sea began to hiss and\nheave, and the ships to reel and tremble, and the roar of a mad volcano\nrose, and nothing kept either shape or tenor, except the faces of brave\nmen.\n\nEvery ship in our fleet was prepared to anchor by the stern, so as to\nspring our broadsides aright; but the anchor of the Goliath did not bite\nso soon as it should have done, so that we ran past the Carrier, and\nbrought up on the larboard quarter of the second French 74, with a\nfrigate and a brig of war to employ a few of our starboard guns. By this\ntime the rapid darkness fell, and we fought by the light of our own\nguns. And now the skill of our Admiral and his great ideas were\nmanifest, for every French ship had two English upon it, and some of\nthem even three at a time. In a word, we began with the head of their\nline, and crushed it, and so on joint by joint, ere even the centre and\nmuch more the tail could fetch their way up to take part in it. Our\nantagonist was the first that struck, being the second of the\nFrenchman\'s line, and by name the Conquer-ant. But she found in Captain\nFoley and David Llewellyn an ant a little too clever to conquer. We were\na good deal knocked about, with most of our main rigging shot away, and\nall our masts heavily wounded. Nevertheless we drew ahead, to double\nupon the third French ship, of the wonderful name of Sparticipate.\n\nFrom this ship I received a shot, which, but for the mercy of the Lord,\nmust have made a perfect end of me. That my end may be perfect has long\nbeen my wish, and the tenor of my life leads up to it. Nevertheless, who\nam I to deny that I was not ready for the final finish at that very\nmoment? And now, at this time of writing, I find myself ready to wait a\nbit longer. What I mean was a chain-shot sailing along, rather slowly as\nthey always do; and yet so fast that I could not either duck or jump at\nsight of it, although there was light enough now for anything, with the\nFrench Admiral on fire. Happening to be well satisfied with my state of\nmind at that moment (not from congratulation, so much as from my inside\nconscience), I now was beginning to fill a pipe, and to dwell upon\nfurther manÅ\x93uvres. For one of the foremost points of all, after\nthoroughly drubbing the enemy, is to keep a fine self-control, and be\nready to go on with it.\n\nNo sooner had I filled this pipe, and taken a piece of wadding to light\nit, which was burning handy (in spite of all my orders), than away went\na piece of me; and down went I, as dead as a Dutch herring. At least so\neverybody thought, who had time to think about it; and ""the Master\'s\ndead"" ran along the deck, so far as time was to tell of it. I must have\nlain numb for an hour, I doubt, with the roar of the guns, and the\nshaking of bulkheads, like a shiver, jarring me, and a pool of blood\ncurdling into me, and another poor fellow cast into the scuppers and\nclutching at me in his groaning, when the heavens took fire in one red\nblaze, and a thundering roar, that might rouse the dead, drowned all the\nrolling battle-din. I saw the white looks of our crew all aghast, and\ntheir bodies scared out of death\'s manufacture, by this triumph of\nmortality; and the elbows of big fellows holding the linstock fell\nquivering back to their shaken ribs. For the whole sky was blotched with\nthe corpses of men, like the stones of a crater cast upwards; and the\nsheet of the fire behind them showed their knees and their bellies, and\nstreaming hair. Then with a hiss, like electric hail, from a mile\'s\nheight, all came down again, corpses first (being softer things), and\ntimbers next, and then the great spars that had streaked the sky like\nrockets.\n\nThe violence of this matter so attracted my attention that I was enabled\nto rally my wits, and lean on one elbow and look at it. And I do assure\nyou that anybody who happened to be out of sight of it, lost a finer\nchance than ever he can have another prospect of. For a\nhundred-and-twenty-gun ship had blown up, with an Admiral and\nRear-Admiral, not to mention a Commodore, and at least 700 complement.\nAnd when the concussion was over, there fell the silence of death upon\nall men. Not a gun was fired, nor an order given, except to man the\nboats in hopes of saving some poor fellows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nA SAVAGE DEED.\n\n\nNevertheless our Britons were forced to renew the battle afterwards;\nbecause those Frenchmen had not the manners to surrender as they should\nhave done. And they even compelled us to batter their ships so seriously\nand sadly, that when we took possession some were scarcely worth the\ntrouble. To make us blow up their poor Admiral was a distressing thing\nto begin with; but when that was done, to go on with the battle was as\nbad as the dog in the manger. What good could it do them to rob a poor\nBritish sailor of half his prize-money? And such conduct becomes at\nleast twice as ungenerous when they actually have wounded him!\n\nMy wound was sore, and so was I, on the following day, I can tell you;\nfor not being now such a very young man, I found it a precious hard\nthing to renew the power of blood that was gone from me. And after the\nterrible scene that awoke me from the first trance of carnage, I was\nthrown by the mercy of Providence into pure insensibility. This I am\nbound to declare; because the public might otherwise think itself\nwronged, and perhaps even vote me down as of no value, for failing to\ngive them the end of this battle so brilliantly as the beginning. I defy\nmy old rival, the Newton tailor (although a much younger man perhaps\nthan myself, and with my help a pretty good seaman), to take up the\ntucks of this battle as well as I have done,--though not well done. Even\nif a tailor can come up and fight (which he did, for the honour of\nCambria), none of his customers can expect any more than French-chalk\nflourishes when a piece of description is down in his books. However,\nlet him cut his cloth. He is still at sea, or else under it; and if he\never does come home, and sit down to his shop-board--as his wife says he\nis sure to do--his very first order shall be for a church-going coat,\nwith a doubled-up sleeve to it.\n\nFor the Frenchmen took my left arm away in a thoroughly lubberly manner.\nIf they had done it with a good cross-cut, like my old wound of forty\nyears\' standing, I would at once have set it down to the credit of their\nnation. But when I came to dwell over the subject (as for weeks my duty\nwas), more and more clear to me it became, that instead of honour they\nhad now incurred a lasting national disgrace. The fellows who charged\nthat gun had been afraid of the recoil of it. Half a charge of powder\nmakes the vilest fracture to deal with--however, there I was by the\nheels, and now for nobler people. Only while my wound is green you must\nnot be too hard on me.\n\nThe Goliath was ordered to chase down the bay, on the morning after the\nbattle, together with the Theseus and a frigate called the Leader. This\nfrigate was commanded by the Honourable Rodney Bluett, now a\npost-captain, and who had done wonders in the height of last night\'s\ncombat. He had brought up in the most brazen-faced manner, without any\nsense of his metal, close below the starboard bow of the great\nthree-decker Orient and the quarter of the Franklin, and thence he fired\naway at both, while all their shot flew over him. And this was\nafterwards said to have been the cleverest thing done by all of us,\nexcept the fine helm and calm handling of H.M. ship Goliath.\n\nThe two ships, in chase of which we were despatched, ran ashore and\nsurrendered, as I was told afterwards (for of course I was down in my\nberth at the time, with the surgeon looking after me); and thus out of\nthirteen French sail of the line, we took or destroyed eleven. And as we\nbore up after taking possession, the Leader ran under our counter and\nhailed us, ""Have you a Justice of the Peace on board?"" Our Captain\nreplied that he was himself a member of the quorum, but could not attend\nto such business now as making of wills and so on. Hereupon Captain\nBluett came forward, and with a polite wave of his hat called out that\nCaptain Foley would lay him under a special obligation, as well as clear\nthe honour of a gallant naval officer, by coming on board of the Leader,\nto receive the deposition of a dying man. In ten minutes\' time our good\nskipper stood in the cockpit of the Leader, while Captain Bluett wrote\ndown the confession of a desperately-wounded seaman, who was clearing\nhis conscience of perilous wrong before he should face his Creator. The\npoor fellow sate on a pallet propped up by the bulkhead and a pillow;\nthat is to say, if a man can sit who has no legs left him. A round shot\nhad caught him in the tuck of both thighs, and the surgeon could now do\nno more for him. Indeed he was only enabled to speak, or to gasp out his\nlast syllables, by gulps of raw brandy which he was taking, with great\ndraughts of water between them. On the other side of his dying bed stood\nCannibals Dick and Joe, howling, and nodding their heads from time to\ntime, whenever he lifted his glazing eyes to them for confirmation. For\nit was my honest and highly-respected friend, the poor Jack Wildman, who\nnow lay in this sad condition, upon the very brink of another world. And\nI cannot do better than give his own words, as put into shape by two\nclear-witted men, Captains Foley and Rodney Bluett. Only for the\nreader\'s sake I omit a great deal of groaning.\n\n""_This is the solemn and dying delivery_ of me, known as \'Jack Wildman,\'\nA.B. seaman of H.M. frigate Leader, now off the coast of Egypt, and\ndying through a hurt in battle with the Frenchmen. I cannot tell my\nname, or age, or where I was born, or anything about myself; and it\ndoes not matter, as I have nothing to leave behind me. Dick and Joe are\nto have my clothes, and my pay if there is any; and the woman that used\nto be my wife is to have my medals for good behaviour in the three\nbattles I have partaken of. My money would be no good to her, because\nthey never use it; but the women are fond of ornaments.\n\n""I was one of a race of naked people, living in holes of the earth at a\nplace we did not know the name of. I now know that it was Nympton in\nDevonshire, which is in England, they tell me. No one had any right to\ncome near us, except the great man who had given us land, and defended\nus from all enemies.\n\n""His name was Parson Chouane, I believe, but I do not know how to spell\nit. He never told us of a thing like God; but I heard of it every day in\nthe navy whenever my betters were angry. Also I learned to read\nwonderful writings; but I can speak the truth all the same.\n\n""Ever since I began to be put into clothes, and taught to kill other\npeople, I have longed to tell of an evil thing which happened once among\nus. How long ago I cannot tell, for we never count time as you do, but\nit must have been many years back, for I had no hair on my body except\nmy head. We had a man then who took lead among us, so far as there was\nany lead; and I think that he thought himself my father, because he gave\nme the most victuals. At any rate we had no other man to come near him\nin any cunningness. Our master Chouane came down sometimes, and took a\npride in watching him, and liked him so much that he laughed at him,\nwhich he never did to the rest of us.\n\n""This man, my father as I may call him, took me all over the great brown\nmoors one night in some very hot weather. In the morning we came to a\ngreat heap of houses, and hid in a copse till the evening. At dusk we\nset out again, and came to a great and rich house by the side of a\nriver. The lower port-holes seemed full of lights, and on the flat place\nin front of them a band of music--such as now I love--was playing, and\npeople were dancing. I had never heard such a thing before; and my\nfather had all he could do to keep me in the black trees out of sight of\nthem. And among the thick of the going about we saw our master Chouane\nin his hunting-dress.\n\n""This must have been what great people call a \'masked ball,\' I am sure\nof it; since I saw one, when, in the Bellona, there were many women\nsomewhere. But at the end of the great light place, looking out over\nthe water, there was a quiet shady place for tired people to rest a bit.\nWhen the whole of the music was crashing like a battle, and people going\nround like great flies in a web, my father led me down by the\nriver-side, and sent me up some dark narrow steps, and pointed to two\nlittle babies. The whole of the business was all about these, and the\nfestival was to make much of them. The nurse for a moment had set them\nupright, while she just spoke to a young sailor-man; and crawling, as\nall of us can, I brought down these two babies to my father; and one was\nheavy, and the other light.\n\n""My father had scarcely got hold of them, and the nurse had not yet\nmissed them, when on the dark shore by the river-side, perhaps five\nfathoms under the gaiety, Parson Chouane came up to my father, and\nwhispered, and gave orders. I know not what they said, for I had no\nsense of tongues then, nor desired it; for we knew what we wanted by\nsigns, and sounds, and saved a world of trouble so. Only I thought that\nour master was angry at having the girl-child brought away. He wanted\nonly the boy perhaps, who was sleepy and knew nothing. But the\ngirl-child shook her hand at him, and said, \'E bad man, Bardie knows\n\'a.\'\n\n""I--every one of us--was amazed--so very small----Oh, sir, I can tell\nyou no more, I think.""\n\n""Indeed then, but you must, my friend,"" cried Captain Foley, with spirit\nenough to set a dead man talking; ""finish this story, you thief of the\nworld, before you cheat the hangman. Two lovely childer stolen away from\na first-rate family to give a ball of that kind--and devil a bit you\nrepent of it!""\n\nPoor dying Jack looked up at him, and then at the place where his legs\nshould have been, and he seemed ashamed for the want of them. Then he\nplayed with the sheet for a twitch or two, as if proud of his arms still\nremaining; and checked back the agony tempting him now to bite it with\nhis great white teeth.\n\n""Ask the rest of us, Captain,"" he said; ""Joe, you know it; Dick, you\nknow it; now that I am telling you. The boy was brought up with us, and\nyou call him Harry Savage. I knew the great house when I saw it again.\nAnd I longed to tell the good old man there; but for the sake of our\npeople. Chouane would have destroyed them all. I was tempted after they\npelted me so, and the old man was so good to me; but something always\nstopped me, and I wanted poor Harry to go to Heaven----Oh, a little\ndrink of water!""\n\nCaptain Foley was partly inclined to take a great deal of poor Jack\'s\nconfession for no more than the raving of a light-headed man; but Rodney\nBluett conjured him to take down every word of it. And when this young\nofficer spoke of his former chief and well-known friend, now Commodore\nSir Drake Bampfylde (being knighted for service in India), and how all\nhis life he had lain under a cloud by reason of this very matter, not\nanother word did our Captain need from him, but took up his pen again.\n\n""I ought to have told,"" said the dying man slowly; ""only I could not\nbring myself. But now you will know, you will all know now. My father is\ndead; but Dick and Joe can swear that the boy is the baby. He had\nbeautiful clothes on, they shone in the boat; but the girl-child had on\nno more than a smock, that they might see her dancing. Our master did\nnot stay with us a minute, but pushed us all into a boat on the tide,\ncut the rope, and was back with the dancers. My father had learned just\nenough of a boat to keep her straight in the tide-way, and I had to lie\ndown over the babies, to keep their white clothes from notice. We went\nso fast that I was quite scared, having never been afloat before, so\nthere must have been a strong ebb under us. And the boat, which was\nwhite, must have been a very light one, for she heeled with every\nmotion. At last we came to a great broad water, which perhaps was the\nriver\'s mouth, with the sea beyond it. My father got frightened perhaps;\nand I know that I had been frightened long ago. By a turn of the eddy,\nwe scrambled ashore, and carried the boy-baby with us; but the boat\nbroke away with a lurch as we jumped, for we had not the sense to bring\nout the rope. In half a minute she was off to sea, and the girl-baby lay\nfast asleep in her stern. And now after such a long voyage in the dark,\nwe were scared so that we both ran for our lives, and were safe before\ndaybreak at Nympton.\n\n""My father before we got home stripped off the little boy\'s clothes, and\nburied them in a black moor-hole full of slime, with a great white stone\nin the midst of it. And the child himself was turned over naked to herd\nwith the other children (for none of our women look after them), and\nnobody knew or cared to know who he was, or whence he came, except my\npoor father, and our master--and I myself, many years afterwards. But\nnow I know well, and I cannot have quiet to die, without telling\nsomebody. The boy-baby I was compelled to steal was Sir Philip\nBampfylde\'s grandson, and the baby-girl his granddaughter. I never heard\nwhat became of her. She must have been drowned, or starved, most likely.\nBut as for the boy, he kept up his life; and the man who took us most in\nhand, of the name of \'Father David,\' gave the names to all of us, and\nthe little one \'Harry Savage,\' now serving on board of the Vanguard. I\nknow nothing of the buried images found by Father David. My father had\nnothing to do with that. It may have been another of Chouane\'s plans. I\nknow no more of anything. There, let me die; I have told all I know. I\ncan write my nickname. I never had any other--_Jack Wildman_.""\n\nAt the end of this followed the proper things, and the forms the law is\nmade of, with first of all the sign-manual of our noble Captain Foley,\nwho must have been an Irishman, to lead us into the battle of the Nile,\nwhile in the commission of the Peace. And after him Captain Bluett\nsigned, and two or three warrant-officers gifted with a writing elbow;\nand then a pair of bare-bone crosses, meaning Cannibals Dick and Joe,\nwho could not speak, and much less write, in the depth of their\nemotions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nA RASH YOUNG CAPTAIN.\n\n\nNow if I had been sewn up well in a hammock, and cast overboard (as the\nsurgeon advised), who, I should like to know, would have been left\ncapable of going to the bottom of these strange proceedings? Hezekiah\nwas alive, of course, and prepared to swear to anything, especially\nafter a round-shot must have killed him, but for his greasiness. And\nclever enough no doubt he was, and suspicious, and busy-minded, and\nexpecting to have all Wales under his thumb, because he was somewhere\nabout on the skirts of the great battle I led them into. But granting\nhim skill, and that narrow knowledge of the world which I call\n""cunning;"" granting him also a restless desire to get to the bottom of\neverything, and a sniffing sense like a turnspit-dog\'s, of the shank-end\nbone he is roasting,--none the more for all that could we grant him the\ndownright power, now loudly called for, to put two and two together.\n\nHappily for all parties, poor Hezekiah was not required to make any\nfurther fool of himself. The stump of my arm was in a fine condition\nwhen ordered home with the prizes; and as soon as I felt the old Bay of\nBiscay, over I knocked the doctor. He fitted me with a hook after this,\nin consistence with an old fisherman; and now I have such a whole boxful\nof tools to screw on, that they beat any hand I ever had in the\nworld--if my neighbours would only not borrow them.\n\nTush--I am railing at myself again! Always running down, and holding up\nmyself to ridicule, out of pure contrariety, just because every one else\novervalues me. There are better men in the world than myself; there are\nwiser; there are braver;--I will not be argued down about it--there are\nsome (I am sure) as honest, in their way; and a few almost as truthful.\nHowever, I never yet did come across any other man half so modest. This\nI am forced to allude to now, in departure from my usual practice,\nbecause this quality and nothing else had prevented me from dwelling\nupon, and far more from following up, some shrewd thoughts which had\noccurred to me, loosely, I own, and in a random manner,--still they had\noccurred to me once or twice, and had been dismissed. Why so? Simply\nbecause I trusted other men\'s judgment, and public impression, instead\nof my own superior instinct, and knowledge of weather and tideways.\n\nHow bitterly it repented me now of this ill-founded diffidence, when, as\nwe lay in the Chops of the Channel about the end of October, with a\nnasty head-wind baffling us, Captain Rodney Bluett came on board of us\nfrom the Leader! He asked if the doctor could report the Master as\nstrong enough to support an interview; whereupon our worthy bone-joiner\nlaughed, and showed him into me where I sate at the latter end of a fine\naitch-bone of beef. And then Captain Rodney produced his papers, and\ntold me the whole of his story. I was deeply moved by Jack Wildman\'s\ndeath, though edified much by the manner of it, and some of his last\nobservations. For a naked heathen to turn so soon into a trousered\nChristian, and still more a good fore-top-man, was an evidence of\nunusual grace, even under such doctrine as mine was. Captain Bluett\nspoke much of this, although his religious convictions were not by any\nmeans so intense as mine, while my sinews were under treatment; but even\nwith only one arm and a quarter I seemed to be better fitted to handle\nevents than this young Captain was. His ability was of no common order,\nas he had proved by running his frigate under the very chains of the\nthundering big Frenchman, so that they could not be down on him. And yet\nhe could not see half the bearings of Jack Wildman\'s evidence. We had a\nlong talk, with some hot rum-and-water, for the evenings already were\nchilly; and my natural candour carried me almost into too much of it.\nAnd the Honourable Rodney gazed with a flush of colour at me, when I\ngave him my opinions like a raking broadside.\n\n""You may be right,"" he said; ""you were always so wonderful at a long\nshot, Llewellyn. But really it does seem impossible.""\n\n""Captain,"" I answered; ""how many things seem so, yet come to pass\ncontinually!""\n\n""I cannot gainsay you, Llewellyn, after all my experience of the world.\nI would give my life to find it true. But how are we to establish it?""\n\n""Leave me alone for that, Captain Bluett; if it can be done it shall be\ndone. The idea is entirely my own, remember. It had never occurred to\nyou, had it?""\n\n""Certainly not,"" he replied, with his usual downright honesty; ""my\nreason for coming to you with that poor fellow\'s dying testimony was\nchiefly to cheer you up with the proofs of our old Captain\'s innocence,\nand to show you the turn of luck for young Harry, who has long been so\nshamefully treated. And now I have another thing to tell you about him;\nthat is if you have not heard it.""\n\n""No, I have heard nothing at all. I did not even know what had become of\nhim, until you read Jack\'s confession. With Nelson, on board the\nVanguard!""\n\n""That was my doing,"" said the Honourable Rodney. ""I recommended him to\nvolunteer, and he was accepted immediately, with the character I gave\nhim. But it is his own doing, and proud I am of it, that he is now\njunior lieutenant of Admiral Lord Nelson\'s own ship the Vanguard. Just\nbefore Nelson received his wound, and while powder was being handed up,\nthere came a shell hissing among them, and hung with a sputtering fuse\nin the coil of a cable, and the men fell down to escape it. But young\nHarry with wonderful quickness leaped (as he did, to save me in San\nDomingo), and sent the fuse over the side with a dash. Then Nelson came\nup, for the firing was hot, and of course he must be in the thick of\nit, and he saw in a moment what Harry had done, and he took down his\nname for promotion, being just what himself would have loved to do. It\nwill have to be confirmed, of course; but of that there can be no\nquestion, after all that we have done; and when it turns out who he is.""\n\n""I am heartily glad of it, Captain,"" I cried; ""the boy was worthy of any\nrank. Worth goes a little way; birth a long way. But all these things\nhave to be lawfully proven.""\n\n""Oh, you old village-lawyer; as we used to call you, at Old Newton. And\nyou deserved it, you rogue, you did. You may have lost your left hand;\nbut your right has not lost its cunning."" He spoke in the purest play\nand jest; and with mutual esteem we parted. Only I stipulated for a good\ntalk with him about our measures, when I should have determined them; or\nat the latest on reaching port.\n\nThe boldest counsel is often the best, and naturally recommends itself\nto a man of warlike character. My first opinion, especially during the\nindignant period, was that nothing could be wiser, or more spirited, or\nmore striking, than to march straight up to Parson Chowne and confront\nhim with all this evidence, taken down by a magistrate, and dare him to\ndeny it; and then hale him off to prison, and (if the law permitted)\nhang him. That this was too good for him, every one who has read my\nwords must acknowledge; the best thing, moreover, that could befall him;\nfor his body was good, though his soul was bad; and he might have some\nhopes to redeem the latter at the expense of the former. And if he had\nnot, through life, looked forward to hanging as his latter end and\nsalvation, it is quite impossible to account for the licence he allowed\nhimself.\n\nHowever, on second thoughts I perceived that the really weighty concern\nbefore us, and what we were bound to think first of, was to restore such\na fine old family to its health and happiness. To reinstate, before he\ndied, that noble and most kind-hearted man, full of religious feeling\nalso, and of confidence that the Lord having made a good man would look\nafter him--which is the very spirit of King David, when his self-respect\nreturns--in a word, to replace in the world\'s esteem, and (what matters\nfar more) in true family love, that fine and pure old gentleman, the\nmuch-troubled Sir Philip Bampfylde,--this, I say, was the very first\nduty of a fellow nursed by a general and a baronet through the\nsmall-pox; while it was also a feat well worthy of the master of a\nline-of-battle ship, which was not lost in the battle of the Nile. And\nscarcely second even to this was the duty and joy of restoring to their\nproper rank in life two horribly injured and innocent creatures, one of\nwhom was our own Bardie. Therefore, upon the whole, it seemed best to go\nto work very warily.\n\nSo it came to pass that I followed my usual practice of wholly\nforgetting myself; and receiving from the Honourable Rodney Bluett that\nmost important document, I sewed it up in the watered silk-bag with my\ncaul and other muniments, and set out for Narnton Court, where I found\nboth Polly, and the cook, and the other comforts. But nothing would do\nfor our Captain Rodney--all young men are so inconsiderate--except to be\noff at racing speed for Candleston Court, and his sweetheart Delushy,\nand the excellent Colonel\'s old port wine. And as he was so brisk, I\nwill take him first, with your good leave, if ever words of mine can\nkeep up with him. But of course you will understand that I tell what\ncame to my knowledge afterwards.\n\nWith all the speed of men and horses, young Rodney Bluett made off for\nhome, and when he got there his luck was such as to find Delushy in the\nhouse. It happened to be her visiting time, according to the old\narrangement, and this crafty sailor found it out from the fine old woman\nat the lodge. So what did he do but discharge his carriage, and leave\nall his kit with her, and go on, with the spright foot of a mariner, to\nthe ancient house which he knew so well. Then this tall and bold young\nCaptain entered by the butler\'s door, the trick of which was well known\nto him, and in a room out of the lobby he stood, without his own mother\nknowing it. It was the fall of autumnal night, when everything is so\nrich and mellow, when the waning daylight ebbs, like a great spring-tide\nexhausted, into the quickening flow of starlight. And the plates were\nbeing cleared away after a snug dinner-party.\n\nThe good Colonel sat at the head of his table, after the ladies\'\nwithdrawal, with that modest and graceful kindliness, which is the sure\nmark of true blood. Around him were a few choice old friends, such as\nonly good men have; friends, who would scout the evidence of their own\neyes against him. According to our fine old fashion, these were drinking\nhealths all round, not with undue love of rare port, so much as with\ntruth and sincerity.\n\nRodney made a sign to Crumpy (who had been shaking him by both hands,\nuntil the tears prevented him), just to please to keep all quiet\ntouching his arrival; and to let him have a slice or two of the haunch\nof venison put to grill, if there was any left of it, and give it him\nall on a plate: together with a twelve-pound loaf of farmhouse bread,\nsuch as is not to be had outside of Great Britain. This was done in\nabout five minutes (for even Mrs Cook respected Crumpy); and being\nserved up, with a quart of ale, in Crumpy\'s own head privacy, it had\nsuch a good effect that the Captain was ready to face anybody.\n\nOld Crumpy was a most crafty old fellow--which was one reason why I\nliked him, as a contrast to my frankness--and he managed it all, and\nkept such a look-out, that no one suspected him of any more than an\nhonoured old chum in his stronghold. Captain Bluett also knew exactly\nwhat his bearings were, and from a loftier point of view than would ever\noccur to Crumpy. A man who had carried a 50-gun ship right under the\nlower port-holes of a 120-gun enemy, and without any orders to that\neffect, and only from want of some easier business, he (I think) may be\ntrusted to get on in almost anything.\n\nThis was the very thing--I do believe--occurring to the mind of somebody\nsitting, as nearly as might be now, upon a very beautiful sofa. The\nloveliest work that you can imagine lay between her fingers; and she was\ndoing her very best to carry it on consistently. But on her lap lay a\nLondon paper, full of the highest authority; and there any young eyes\nmight discover a regular pit-pat of tears.\n\n""My dear, my dear,"" said Lady Bluett, being not so very much better\nherself, although improved by spectacles; ""it is a dreadful, dreadful\nthing to think of those poor Frenchmen killed, so many at a time, and\nall in their sins. I do hope they had time to think, ever so little, of\ntheir latter end. It makes me feel quite ill to think of such a dreadful\ncarnage, and to know that my own son was foremost in it. Do you think,\nmy dear, that your delicate throat would be any worse in the morning, if\nyou were to read it once more to me? The people in the papers are so\nclever; and there was something I did not quite catch about poor\nRodney\'s recklessness. How like his dear father, to be sure! I see him\nin every word of it.""\n\n""Auntie, the first time I read it was best. The second and third time, I\ncried worse and worse; and the fourth time, you know what you said of\nme. And I know that I deserved it, Auntie, for having such foolish weak\neyes like that. You know what I told you about Captain Rodney, and\nbegged you to let me come here no more. And you know what you said--that\nit was a child\'s fancy; and if it were not, it should take its course.\nThe Colonel was wiser. Oh, Auntie, Auntie! why don\'t you always harken\nhim!""\n\n""For a very good reason, my dear child--he always proves wrong in the\nend; and I don\'t. I have the very highest and purest respect for my dear\nbrother\'s judgment. Every one knows what his mind is, and every one\nvalues his judgment. And no stranger, of course, can enter into him, his\nviews, and his largeness, and intellect; as I do, when I agree with him.\nThere, you have made me quite warm, my dear; I am so compelled to\nvindicate him.""\n\n""I am so sorry--I did not mean--you know what I am, Auntie.""\n\n""My dear, I know what you are, and therefore it is that I love you so.\nNow go and wash your pretty eyes, and read that again to me, and to the\nColonel. Many mothers would be proud perhaps. I feel no pride whatever,\nbecause my son could not help doing it.""\n\nThere was something else this excellent lady\'s son could not help doing.\nHe caught the beautiful maid of Sker in her pure white dress in a nook\nof the passage, and with tears of pride for him rolling from her dark\ngrey eyes, and he could not help--but all lovers, I trow, know how much\nto expect of him.\n\n""Thank you, Rodney,"" Delushy cried; ""to a certain extent, I am grateful.\nBut, if you please, no more of it. And you need not suppose that I was\ncrying about, about,--about anything.""\n\n""Of course not, you darling. How long have I lived, not to know that\ngirls cry about nothing? nine times out of ten at least. Pearly tears,\nnow prove your substance.""\n\n""Rodney, will you let me alone? I am not a French decker of 500 guns,\nfor you to do just what you like with. And I don\'t believe any one knows\nyou are here. Yes, yes, yes! Ever so many darlings, if you like--and\n\'with my whole heart I do love you,\' as darling Moxy says. But one\nthing, this moment, I insist upon--no, not in your ear, nor yet through\nyour hair, you conceited curly creature; but at the distance of a yard I\npronounce that you shall come to your mother.""\n\n""Oh, what a shame!"" And with that unfilial view of the subject, he\nrendered himself, after all those mortal perils, into the arms of his\nmother. With her usual quickness Delushy fled, but came back to the\ndrawing-room very sedately, and with a rose-coloured change of dress, in\nabout half an hour afterwards.\n\n""How do you do, Captain Rodney Bluett?""\n\n""Madam, I hope that I see you well.""\n\nLady Bluett was amazed at the coolness of them, and in her heart\ndisappointed; although she was trying to argue it down, and to say to\nherself, ""How wise of them!"" She knew how the Colonel loved this young\nmaid, yet never could bear to think of his nephew taking to wife a mere\nwaif of the sea. The lady had faith in herself that she might in the end\novercome this prejudice. But of course if the young ones had ceased to\ncare for it, she could only say that young people were not of the stuff\nthat young people used to be.\n\nWhile she revolved these things in her tender, warm, and motherly bosom,\nthe gentlemen came from the dining-room, to pay their compliments to the\nladies, and to have their tea and all that, according to the recent\nstyle of it. They bowed very decently, as they came in, not being topers\nby any means: and the lady of the house arose and curtsied to them most\ngracefully. Then Rodney, who had found occasion ere this to salute\nColonel Lougher and his visitors, led forward the maid, and presented\nher to them, with a very excellent naval bow.\n\n""My dear uncle, and friends of the family,"" he began, while she trembled\na little, and looked at him with astonishment; ""allow me the favour of\npresenting to you a lady who will do me the honour of becoming my wife,\nvery shortly, I hope.""\n\nThe Colonel drew back with a frown on his face. Lady Bluett on the other\nhand ran up.\n\n""What is the meaning of this?"" she cried. ""And not a word of it to your\nown mother! Oh, Andalusia, how shocking of you!""\n\n""I think, sir,"" said the Colonel, looking straight at the youth, ""that\nyou might have chosen a better moment to defy your uncle, than in the\npresence of his oldest friends. It is not like a gentleman, sir. It cuts\nme to the heart to say such a thing to the son of my own sister. But,\nsir, it is not like a gentleman.""\n\nThe old friends nodded to one another, in approval of this sentiment;\nand turned to withdraw from a family scene.\n\n""Wait, if you please,"" cried Rodney Bluett. ""Colonel Lougher, I should\ndeserve your reproach, if I had done anything of the kind. My intention\nis not to defy you, sir; but to please you and gratify you, my dear\nuncle, as your lifelong kindness to me and to this young lady deserves.\nAnd I have chosen to do it before old friends, that your pleasure may be\nincreased by their congratulations. Instead of being ashamed, sir, of\nthe origin of your future niece--or you my dear mother of your daughter,\nyou may well be proud of it. She belongs to one of the oldest families\nin the West of England. She is the grandchild of Sir Philip Bampfylde of\nNarnton Court, near Barnstaple. And I think I have heard my mother speak\nof him as an old friend of my father.""\n\n""To be sure, to be sure!"" exclaimed Lady Bluett, ere the Colonel could\nrecover himself: ""the Bluetts are an old west-country family; but the\nBampfyldes even older. Come to me, my pretty darling. There, don\'t cry\nso; or if you must, come in here, and I will help you. Rodney, my dear,\nyou have delighted us, and you have done it most cleverly. But excuse my\nsaying that an officer in the army would have known a little better what\nladies are, than to have thrown them into this excitement, even in the\npresence of valued friends. Come here, my precious. The gentlemen will\nexcuse us for a little while.""\n\n""Let me kiss Colonel Lougher first,"" whispered Delushy; all frightened,\ncrying, and quivering as she was, she could not forget her gratitude. So\nshe bowed her white forehead, and drooped her dark lashes under the old\nman\'s benevolent gaze.\n\n""Sit down, my dear friends,"" said Colonel Lougher, as soon as the ladies\nhad left the room. ""My good nephew\'s tactics have been rather blunt, and\nof the Aboukir order. However, he may be quite right if this matter\nrequires at once to be spread abroad. At any rate, my dear boy, I owe\nyou an apology. Rodney, I beg your pardon for the very harsh terms I\nused to you.""\n\nWith these words he stood up, and bowed to his nephew; who did the same\nto him in silence, and then they shook hands warmly. After which the\nyoung Captain told his story, to which they all listened intently--five\nbeing justices of the shire, and one the lord-lieutenant--all accustomed\nto examine evidence.\n\n""It seems very likely,"" said Colonel Lougher, as they waited for his\nopinion. ""That David Llewellyn is a most shrewd fellow. But he ought to\nhave said more about the boat. There is one thing, however, to be done\nat once--to collect confirmative evidence.""\n\n""There is another thing to be done at once,"" cried Rodney Bluett,\nwarmly--""to pull Chowne\'s nose. And despite his cloth, I will do it\nroundly.""\n\n""My young friend,"" said the Lord-Lieutenant; ""prove it first. And then,\nI think, there are some people who would pardon you.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nPOLLY AT HOME.\n\n\nLest any one should be surprised that Sir Philip Bampfylde could have\npaid two visits to this delightful neighbourhood, without calling on our\nleading gentleman, and his own fellow-officer, Colonel Lougher--in which\ncase the questions concerning Delushy would have been sifted long ago--I\nhad better say at once what it was that stopped him. When the General\nthought it just worth while, though his hopes were faint about it, to\ninquire into the twisted story of the wreck on our coast, as given by\nthe celebrated Felix Farley; the first authority he applied to was\nCoroner Bowles, who had held the inquest. Coroner Bowles told him all he\nknew (half of which was wrong, of course, by means of Hezekiah) and gave\nhim a letter to Anthony Stew, as the most active and penetrating\nmagistrate of the neighbourhood. Nothing could have been more unlucky.\nNot only did Stew baffle my desire to be more candid than the day\nitself, by his official brow-beating, and the antipathy between us--not\nonly did Stew, like an over-sharp fellow, trust one of the biggest\nrogues unhung--in his unregenerate dissenting days, and before we gave\nhim six dozen, which certainly proved his salvation--(I am sorry to say\nsuch things of my present good neighbour, \'Kiah; but here he is now, and\nsubscribes to it) Hezekiah Perkins, whose view of the shipwreck, and\nlearned disquisition on sand, misled the poor Coroner and all of the\nJury, except myself, so blindly, that we drowned the five young men, and\nsmothered the baby--not only did Stew, I say, get thus far in\nbewilderment of the subject, but he utterly ruined all chance of\nclearing it, by keeping Sir Philip from Candleston Court!\n\nIf you ask me how, I can only say, in common fairness to Anthony Stew\n(who is lately gone, poor fellow, to be cross-examined by somebody\nsharper even than himself--one to whom I would never afford material for\nunpleasant questions, by speaking amiss of a man in his\npower--especially when so needless), in a word, to treat Stew as I hope\nmyself to be treated by survivors, I admit that he may not have wished\nto keep Sir Philip away from the Colonel. But the former having once\naccepted Stew\'s keen hospitality, and tried to eat fish (which I might\nhave bettered, had I known of his being there), felt, with his usual\ndelicacy, that he ought not to visit a man at feud with the host whose\nsalt--and very little else--he was then enjoying. For Mrs Stew was more\nbitter of course than even her husband against Colonel Lougher, and\nroundly abused him the very first evening of Sir Philip\'s stay with\nthem. So that the worthy General passed the gates of the excellent\nColonel, half-a-dozen times perhaps, without once passing through them.\n\nEnough about that; and I need only say, before returning to my own\nimportant and perhaps sagacious inquiries in Devonshire, that the news,\nso hastily blurted out by Captain Rodney Bluett, caused many glad hearts\nin our parish and neighbourhood; but nevertheless two sad ones. Of these\none belonged to Roger Berkrolles, and the other to Moxy Thomas. The\nchild had so won upon both these, not only by her misfortunes and the\nway in which she bore them, but by her loving disposition, bright\nmanner, and docility, that it seemed very hard to lose her so, even\nthough it were for her own good. Upon this latter point Master\nBerkrolles, when I came to see him, held an opinion, the folly of which\nsurprised me, from a man of such reading and history. In real earnest he\nlaid down that it might be a very bad thing for the maid, and make\nagainst her happiness, to come of a sudden into high position,\nimportance, and even money. Such sentiments are to be found, I believe,\nin the weaker parts of the Bible, such as are called the New Testament,\nwhich nobody can compare to the works of my ancestor, King David; and\nwhich, if you put aside Saint Paul, and Saint Peter (who cut the man\'s\near off, and rejected quite rightly the table-cloth), exhibit to my mind\nnobody of a patriotic spirit.\n\nAs for Moxy, she would not have been a woman if she had doubted about\nthe value of high position, coin of the realm, and rich raiment.\nNevertheless she cried bitterly that this child, as good as her own to\nher, and given her to make up for them, and now so clever to see to\nthings, and to light the fire, and show her the way Lady Bluett put her\ndress on, should be taken away in a heap as it were, just as if the\ngreat folk had minded her. She blamed our poor Bunny for stealing the\nheart of young Watkin, who might have had the maid (according to his\nmother\'s fancy) with money enough to restock the farm, now things had\nproved so handsome. As if everybody did not know that Bardie would never\nthink twice of Watkin; while his mother, hearing of the ships I had\ntaken (as all over the parish reported), had put poor Watkin on bread\nand water, until he fell in love with Bunny! However, now she cried very\nseverely, and in a great measure she meant it.\n\nLeaving all Newton, and Nottage, and Sker, and even Bridgend to consider\nthese matters, with a pleasing divergence of facts and conclusions, I\nfind it my duty, however repugnant, to speak once more of my humble\nself. In adversity, my native dignity and the true grandeur of Cambria\nhave always united, against my own feelings, to make me almost\nself-confident, or at any rate able to maintain my position, and knock\nunder to nobody. But in prosperity, all this drops; extreme affability,\nand my native longing to give pleasure, mark my deportment towards all\nthe world; and I almost never commit an assault.\n\nIn this fine and desirable frame of mind I arrived at Narnton Court once\nmore, sooner perhaps than Captain Bluett, having so much further to go,\nburst in on his friends at Candleston; although I have given his story\nprecedence, not only on account of his higher rank, but because of the\nhurry he was in. On the other hand, my part seemed to be of a nice and\ndelicate character--to find out all that I could without making any\nnoise in the neighbourhood, to risk no chance, if it might be helped, of\nexciting Sir Philip Bampfylde, and, above all things, no possibility of\narousing Chowne, till the proper time. For his craft was so great that\nhe might destroy every link of evidence, if he once knew that we were in\nchase of him; even as he could out-fox a fox.\n\nWhen things of importance take their hinge, a good deal, upon feminine\nevidence, the first thing a wise man always does is to seek female\ninstinct, if he sees his way to guide it. And to have the helm of a\nwoman, nothing is so certain as a sort of a promise of marriage. A man\nneed not go too very far, and must be awake about pen and ink, and\nwitnesses, and so on; but if he knows how to do it, and has lost an arm\nin battle, but preserved an unusually fine white beard, and has had\nanother wife before, who was known to make too little of him, the fault\nis his own if he cannot manage half-a-dozen spinsters.\n\nMy reputation had outrun me--as it used to do, sometimes too often--for\nin the despatches my name came after scarcely more than fifty, though it\nshould have been one of the foremost five; however, my wound was\nhandsomely chronicled, and with a touch of my own description, such as\nis really heartfelt. Of course it was not quite cured yet, and I felt\nvery shy about it; and the very last thing I desired was for the women\nto come bothering. Tush! I have no patience with them; they make such a\nfuss of a trifle.\n\nBut being bound upon such an errand, and anxious to conciliate them so\nfar as self-respect allowed, and knowing that if I denied myself to\nthem, the movement would be much greater, I let them have peeps, and\nperceive at the same time that I really did want a new set of shirts.\nHalf-a-dozen of damsels began at once to take my measure: and the result\nwill last my lifetime.\n\nBut, amid all this glorification, whenever I thought of settling, there\nwas one pretty face that I longed to see, and to my mind it beat the\nwhole of them. What was become of my pretty Polly, the lover of my\ntruthful tales, and did she still remember a brave, though not young\nofficer in the Navy, who had saved her from the jaws of death, by\ncatching small-pox from her? These questions were answered just in time,\nand in the right manner also, by the appearance of Polly herself,\noutblushing the rose at sight of me, and without a spot on her face,\nexcept from the very smart veil she was wearing. For she was no longer a\nservant now, but free and independent, and therefore entitled to take\nthe veil, and she showed her high spirit by doing this, to the deep\nindignation of all our maid-servants. And still more indignant were\nthese young women, when Polly demeaned herself, as they declared, with a\nperfectly shameless and brazen-faced manner of carrying on towards the\nnoble old tar. They did not allow for the poor thing\'s gratitude to the\nonly one who came nigh her in her despairing hour and saved her life\nthereby, nor yet for her sorrow and tender feeling at the dire\nconsequence to him; and it was not in their power, perhaps, to\nsympathise with the shock she felt at my maimed and war-beaten\nappearance. However, I carried the whole of it off in a bantering\nmanner, as usual.\n\nStill there was one resolution I came to, after long puzzling in what\nway to cope with the almost fatal difficulty of having to trust a\nwoman. So I said to myself, that if this must be done, I might make it\nserve two purposes--first for discovery of what I sought, and then for a\ntest of the value of a female, about whom I had serious feelings. These\nwere in no way affected by some news I picked up from Nanette, or, as\nshe now called herself, ""The widow Heaviside."" Not that my old friend\nhad left this world, but that he gave a wide berth to the part\ncontaining his beloved partner. She, with a Frenchwoman\'s wit and\nsagacity, saw the advantage of remaining in the neighbourhood of her\nwrongs; and here with the pity now felt for her, and the help she\nreceived from Sir Philip himself, and her own skill in getting up\nwomen\'s fal lals, she maintained her seven children cleverly.\n\nAfter shedding some natural tears for the admired but fugitive\nHeaviside, she came round, of course, to her neighbours\' affairs; and\nthough she had not been at Narnton Court at the time when the children\nwere stolen, she helped me no little by telling me where to find one who\nknew all that was known of it. This was a farmer\'s wife now at\nBurrington (as I found out afterwards), a village some few leagues up\nthe Tawe, and her name was Mrs Shapland.\n\n""From her my friend the Captain shall decouver the everything of this\nhorrible affair,"" said Nanette, who now spoke fine English. ""She was\nthe--what you call--the bonne, the guard of the leetle infants. I know\nnot where she leeves, some barbarous name. I do forget--but she have one\ncousin, a jolly girl, of the leetle name--pray how can you make such\nthing of \'Mary?\'""\n\n""What! do you mean Polly?"" I asked; ""that is what we make of Mary. And\nwhat Polly is it then, Madame?""\n\n""Yes, Paullee, the Paullee which have that horrible pest that makes\nholes in the faces. \'Verole\' we call it. The Paullee that was in the\ngreat mansion, until she have the money left, the niece of the proud\nwoman of manage. You shall with great facility find that Paullee."" Of\ncourse I could, for she had told me where I might call upon her, which I\ndid that very same afternoon.\n\nAnd a pretty and very snug cottage it was, just a furlong, or so, above\nthe fine old village of Braunton, with four or five beautiful meadows\naround it, and a bright pebbly brook at the turn of the lane. The\ncottage itself, even now in November, was hung all over with China\nroses, and honeysuckle in its second bloom, which it often shows in\nDevonshire. And up at the window, that shook off the thatch, and looked\nwide-awake as a dog\'s house, a face, more bright than the roses, came,\nand went away, and came again, to put a good face upon being caught.\n\nHereupon I dismissed the boys, who, with several rounds of cheers, had\nescorted me through Braunton; and with genuine thankfulness I gazed at\nthe quiet and pleasing prospect. So charming now in the fall of the\nleaf, what would it be in the spring-time, with the meadows all breaking\nanew into green, and the trees all ready for their leaves again? Also\nthese bright red Devonshire cows, all belonging to Polly, and even now\nstreaming milkily--a firkin apiece was the least to expect of them, in\nthe merry May month. A very deep feeling of real peace, and the pleasure\nof small things fell on me; for a man of so many years, and one arm,\nmight almost plead to himself some right to shed his experience over the\nearth, when his blood had been curdling on so many seas.\n\nThe very same thought was in Polly\'s eyes when she ran down and opened\nthe door for me. The whole of this property was her own; or would be, at\nleast, when her old grandmother would allow herself to be buried. That\nold woman now was ninety-five, if the parsons had minded the register;\nand a woman more fully resolved to live on I never had the luck to meet\nwith. And the worst of it was, that her consent to Polly\'s marriage was\nneedful, under the ancient cow-keeper\'s will, with all of the meadows so\ndescribed, that nobody could get out of them. Hereupon, somehow, I\nmanaged to see that a very bold stroke was needed. And I took it, and\nwon the old lady over, by downright defiance. I told her that she was a\ngreat deal too young to have any right to an opinion; and when she\nshould come to my time of life, she would find me ready to hearken her.\nShe said that no doubt it was bred from the wars for sailors to talk so\nbravely; but that I ought to know better--with a fie, and a sigh, and a\nfie again. To none of this would I give ear, but began to rebuke all the\nyoung generations, holding to ridicule those very points upon which they\nespecially plume themselves, until this most excellent woman began to\ncount all her cows on her fingers.\n\n""Her can\'t have them. No, her shan\'t have they,"" she cried, with a power\nwhich proved that she saw them dropping into my jaws almost; ""her han\'t\na got \'em yet; and why should her have \'em?""\n\nInto this very fine feeling and sense of possession I entered so\namiably, that amid much laughter and many blushes on the part of Polly\n(who pretended to treat the whole thing as a joke), the old lady put on\nher silver goggles, and set down her name to a memorandum, prepared on\nthe spur of the moment by me. Whereupon I quite made my mind up to go\nbravely in for it, and recompense Polly for all her faith, and\ngratitude, and frugality, if she should prove herself capable of keeping\ncounsel also.\n\nTo this intent I expressed myself as elegantly as could be, having led\nPolly out to the wooden bridge, that nobody else might hear me. For that\nfine old woman became so deaf, all of a sudden, that I had no faith in\nany more of her organs, and desired to be at safe distance from her, as\nwell as to learn something more of the cows. Nor did I miss the chance;\nfor all of them having been milked by Polly, came up to know what I had\nto say to her, and their smell was beautiful. So I gave them a bit of\nsalt out of my pocket, such as I always carry when ashore, and offered\nthem some tobacco; and they put out their broad yellow lips for the one,\nand snorted and sneezed at the other. When these valuable cows were gone\nto have a little more grazing, I just made Polly aware of the chance\nthat appeared to be open before us. In short, I laid clearly before her\nthe whole of my recent grand discovery, proving distinctly that with\nnothing more than a little proper management, I possessed therein at\nleast an equivalent for her snug meadow homestead, and all the\nmilch-cows, and the trout-stream. Only she must not forget one thing,\nnamely, that the whole of this value would vanish, if a single word of\nthis story were breathed any further off than our own two selves, until\nthe time was ripe for it. Of course I had not been quite such a fool as\nto give Nanette the smallest inkling of any motive on my part beyond\nthat pure curiosity, with which she could so well sympathise. Also it\nhad been settled between Captain Bluett and myself, that a fortnight was\nto be allowed me for hunting up all the evidence, before he should cross\nthe Channel; unless I took it on myself to fetch him.\n\nPolly opened her blue eyes to such a size at all I told her, that I\nbecame quite uneasy lest she should open her mouth in proportion. For if\nmy discovery once took wind before its entire completion, there would be\nat least fifty jealous fellows thrusting their oars into my own\nrowlocks, and robbing me of my own private enterprise. Also Miss Polly\ngave way to a feeling of anger and indignation, which certainly might be\nto some extent natural, but was, to say the least of it, in a far\ngreater measure indiscreet, and even perilous.\n\n""Oh the villain! oh the cruel villain!"" she exclaimed, in a voice that\nquite alarmed me, considering how near the footpath was; ""and a minister\nof the Gospel too! Oh the poor little babes, one adrift on the sea, and\nthe other among them naked savages! What a mercy as they didn\'t eat him!\nAnd to blame the whole of it on a nice, harmless, kind-spoken, handsome\ngentleman, like our Captain! Oh, let me get hold of him!""\n\n""That, my dear Polly, we never shall do, if you raise your voice in this\nway. Now come away from these trees with the ivy, and let us speak very\nquietly.""\n\nThis dear creature did (as nearly as could be expected) what I told her;\nso that I really need not repent of my noble faith in the female race.\nThis encouraged me; from its tendency to abolish prejudice, and to let\nthe weaker vessels show that there is such a thing as a cork to them.\nMen are apt to judge too much by experience on this subject; when they\nought to know that experience never does apply to women, any more than\nreason does.\n\nNevertheless my Polly saw the way in and out of a lot of things, which\nto me were difficult. Especially as to the manner of handling her\ncousin, Mrs Shapland, a very good woman in her way, but a ticklish one\nto deal with. And all the credit for all the truth we get out of Mrs\nShapland belongs not to me (any more than herself), but goes down in a\nlump to poor Polly.\n\nTo pass this lightly--as now behoves me--just let me tell what Susan\nShapland said, when I worked it out of her. Any man can get the truth\nout of a woman, if he knows the way; I mean, of course, so far as she\nhas been able to receive it. To expect more than this is unreasonable;\nand to get that much is wonderful. However, Polly and I, between us, did\nget a good deal of it.\n\nOf course, we did not let this good woman even guess what we wanted with\nher; only we borrowed a farmer\'s cart from Bang, my old boy, who was now\nset up in a farm on his grandmother\'s ashes; and his horse was not to be\nfound fault with, if a man did his duty in lashing him. This I was ready\nto understand, when pointed out by Polly; and he never hoisted his tail\nbut what I raked him under his counter.\n\nSo after a long hill, commanding miles and miles of the course of the\nriver, we fetched up in the courtyard of Farmer Shapland, and found his\nwife a brisk sharp woman, quite ready to tell her story. But what she\ndid first, and for us, at this moment, was to rouse up the fire with a\ngreat dry fagot, crackling and sparkling merrily. For the mist of\nNovember was now beginning to crawl up the wavering valley, and the\nfading light from the west struck coldly on the winding river.\n\nIn such a case, and after a drive of many miles and much scenery, any\nman loves to see pots and pans goaded briskly to bubbling and\nsputtering, or even to help in the business himself, so far as the cook\nwill put up with it. And then if a foolish good woman allows him (as\npride sometimes induces her) to lift up a pot-lid when trembling with\nflavour, or give a shake to the frying-pan in the ecstasy of crackling,\nor even to blow on the iron spoon, and then draw in his breath with a\ndrop of it--what can he want with any scenery out of the window, or\noutside his waistcoat?\n\nSuch was my case, I declare to you, in that hospitable house with these\ngood people of Burrington; nor could we fall to any other business,\nuntil this was done with; then after dark we drew round the fire, with a\nblack-jack of grand old ale, and our pipes, to hear Mrs Shapland\'s\nstory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nSUSAN QUITE ACQUITS HERSELF.\n\n\nIt really does seem as wise a plan as any I am acquainted with, to let\nthis good woman act according to the constitution of her sex,--that is\nto say, to say her say, and never be contradicted. We contradicted her\nonce or twice to reconcile her to herself; but all that came of it was\nto make her contradict perhaps herself, but certainly us, ten times as\nmuch. She did her best to explain her meaning; and we really ought to\nenter more into their disabilities. Therefore let her tell her story, as\nnearly in her own words, poor thing, as my sense of the English language\ncan in any style agree with.\n\n""I was nurse at Narnton Court, ever so many years ago--when my name was\nSusan Moggeridge,--Charley, you cannot deny it, you know; and all of us\nmust be content to grow old, it is foolish to look at things otherwise.\nTwelve and six, that makes eighteen; now, Captain Wells, you know it do;\nand, Charley, can you say otherwise? Then it must have been eighteen\nyears agone, when I was took on for under-nurse, because the Princess\nwas expecting, the same as the butler told me. And it came to pass on a\nSunday night, with two miles away from the doctor. Orders had been\ngiven; but they foreigners always do belie them. Too soon always, or too\nlate; and these two little dears was too soon, by reason of the\nwonderful child the eldest one was prepared for. A maid she was, and the\nother a boy; two real beauties both of them; as fair as could be, with\nlittle clear dots under their skin, in corner places, because of their\nmother the Princess. But nothing as any one would observe, except for a\nbeauty to both of them. The boy was the biggest, though the girl came\nfirst; and first was her nature in everything, except, of course, in\nfatness, and by reason of always dancing. Not six months old was that\nchild before she could dance on the kitchen table with only one hand to\nhold her up, and a pleasure it was to look at her. And laugh with her\nlittle funny face, and nod her head, she would, as if she saw to the\nbottom of everything. And when she were scarce turned the twelvemonth,\nshe could run, like--oh, just like anything, and roll over and over on\nthe grass with her \'Pomyolianian dog,\' as she called him, and there\nwasn\'t a word in the language as ever come amiss to her, but for the r\'s\nor the y\'s in it. Words such as I could lay no tongue to, she would take\nand pronounce right off, and then laugh at herself and everybody. And\nthe way she used to put her hands out, laying down the law to all of\nus--we didn\'t want a showman in the house so long as we had Miss Bertha,\nor \'Bardie,\' as she called herself, though christened after her mother.\nEverybody, the poor little mite, she expected everybody to know her name\nand all about her; and nothing put her in such a passion as to pretend\nnot to know who she was. \'I\'se Bardie,\' she used to cry out, with her\nlittle hands spread, and her bright eyes flashing; \'I\'se Bardie, I tell\n\'a; and evelybody knows it.\' Oh yes, and she never could say \'th\'--but\n\'niss\' and \'nat,\' for this and that. And how angry she used to be, to be\nsure, if anybody mocked her, as we used to do for the fun of it. But\neven there, she was up to us, for she began to talk French, for revenge\nupon us, having taken the trick from her mother.\n\n""Likewise the boy was a different child altogether in many ways. He\nscarcely could learn to speak at all, because he was a very fine child\nindeed, and quiet, and fat, and easy. He would lie by for hours on a\nvelvet cushion, and watch his little sister having her perpetual round\nof play. Dolls, and horses, and Noah\'s arks, and all the things that\nwere alive to her, and she talking to them whiles the hour,--he took no\nmore notice than just to stroke them, and say, \'Boo, boo!\' or \'Poor,\npoor!\' which was nearly all that he could say. Not that he was to blame,\nof course, nor would any one having sense think of it, especially after\nhe took the pink fever, and it struck to his head, and they cut his hair\noff. Beautiful curls as was ever seen, and some of them in my drawer\nup-stairs now, with the colour of gold streaking over them. Philip his\nname was, of course, from Sir Philip, and being the heir to the title;\nbut his clever sister she always called him \'little brother,\' as if he\nwas just born almost, when he weighed pretty nearly two of her.\n\n""Sir Philip, the good old gentleman, was away in foreign parts, they\nsaid, or commanding some of the colonies, up to the time when these two\ntwins were close upon two years old, or so. I remember quite well when\nhe came home with his luggage marked \'General Bampfylde;\' and we said it\nwas disrespectful of the Government to call him so, when his true name\nwas \'Sir Philip.\' He had never seen his grandchildren till now, and what\na fuss he made with them! But they had scarcely time to know him before\nthey were sadly murdered; or worse, perhaps, for all that any one knows\nto the contrary. Because Sir Philip\'s younger son, Captain Drake\nBampfylde, came from the seas and America, just at this time. No one\nexpected him, of course, from among such distant places; and he had not\nbeen home for three years at least, and how noble he did look, until we\nsaw how his shirts were cobbled! And every one all about the place said\nthat his little finger was worth the whole of the Squire\'s body. Because\nthe Squire, his elder brother, and the heir of Sir Philip, was of a\nnature, not to say--but I cannot make it clear to you. No one could say\na word against him; only he were not, what you may call it,--not as we\nDevonshire people are,--not with a smile and kind look of the eye, the\nsame as Captain Drake was.\n\n""This poor Captain Drake--poor or bad, I scarce know which to put it,\nafter all I have heard of him--anyhow his mind was set upon a little\nchit of a thing, not more than fifteen at this time. Her name was Isabel\nCarey, and her father had been a nobleman, and when he departed this\nlife he ordered her off to Narnton Court. So she did at an early age;\nand being so beautiful as some thought, she was desperate with the\nCaptain. They used to go walking all up in the woods, or down on the\nriver in a boat, until it was too bad of them. The Captain, I daresay,\nmeant no harm, and perhaps he did none; but still there are sure to be\ntalkative people who want to give their opinions. If Charley had carried\non so with me, whatever should I have thought of myself?\n\n""Well, there was everybody saying very fine things to everybody, gay\ndoings likewise, and great feasts, and singing, and dancing, and all the\nrest. And the Captain hired a pleasure-boat, by name the \'Wild Duck of\nAppledore;\' and I never shall forget the day when he took a whole pack\nof us for a sail out over Barnstaple bar and back. I was forced to go,\nbecause he needs must take the children; and several even old people\nwere sick, but no one a quarter so bad as me. And it came into my mind\nin that state, that he was longing, as well as welcome, to cast us all\ninto the raging sea. However, the Lord preserved us. This little ship\nhad one mast, as they call it, and he kept her generally in a little\nbend just above the salmon-weir, so as to see the men draw the pool, and\nhimself to shoot the wild-fowl, from a covered place there is; and by\nreason of being so long at sea, he could not sleep comfortable at the\nCourt, but must needs make his bed in this pleasuring-ship, and to it he\nused to go to and fro in a little white boat as belonged to it.\n\n""All this time the weather was so hot we could scarcely bear our clothes\non, and were ready to envy them scandalous savages belonging to the\nfamous Parson Chowne, who went about with no clothes on. There was one\nof these known to be down on the burrows a-bathing of his wife and\nfamily, if a decent woman may name them so. Well, the whole of these gay\ngoings on, to celebrate the return of Sir Philip, and of Captain Drake,\nand all that they owed to the Lord for His goodness, was to finish up\nwith a great dinner to all the tenants on the property; and then on the\nchildren\'s birthday, a feasting of all the gentry around; and a dance\nwith all sorts of outlandish dresses and masks on, in the evening. For\nthe fashion of this was come down from London, and there had been a\nparty of this sort over to Lord Bassett\'s; and the neighbourhood was\nwild with it. And after this everything was to be quiet, because my Lady\nthe Princess Bertha was again beginning to expect almost.\n\n""And now, Captain Wells, you would hardly believe what a blow there was\nsent, by the will of the Lord, upon all of this riot and revelry. There\nwas many of us having pious disposals, as well as religious\nbringings-up, whose stomachs really was turned by the worldliness as was\naround us. Young ladies of the very best families, instead of turning\ntheir minds to the Lord, turning of themselves about, with young men\nlaying hold of them, as if there was nothing more to be said than \'Kiss\nme quick!\' and, \'I\'ll do it again!\' But there was a judgment coming.\nThey might lay the blame on me, if they like. There is folk as knows\nbetter.\n\n""That very night it was so hot, with the sun coming up from the river,\nthat even the great hall the dance was to be in, was only fit to lie\ndown in. So that Captain Drake, in his man-of-war voice, shouted (and I\nthink I can hear him now), \'Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we have\nour dance out on the terrace.\' This was the open made-up flat between\nthe house and the river, and the Captain\'s offer was caught up at,\ndirectly the gentlefolk seen the moon.\n\n""Here they were going on ever so long; and the more of twirling round\nthey had, and of making heel and toe, and crossing arms and even\nfrontesses, the more they seemed to like it; also the music up and down\nalmost as bad as they was; so that what with the harlequin dresses, and\nmasquerading, and mummeries, scarcely any one could have the head to be\nsure of any one else almost. I could not help looking at them, although\nmy place was to heed the children only, and keep them out of mischief,\nand take them to bed at the proper time. But Captain Drake, who was\nhere, there, and elsewhere, making himself agreeable, up he comes to me\nwith a bottle, and he says, \'Mary, have some.\' \'My name is not Mary, but\nSusan, sir, and much at your service,\' I answered; so that he poured me\na great glassful, and said that it was Sam--something. I was not so rude\nas to give him denial, but made him a curtsy, and drank it, for it was\nnot so strong as my father\'s cider; no, nor so good to my liking. And\nfor any to say that it got in my head, shows a very spiteful woman. The\nCaptain went on to the other maids, as were looking on for the life of\nthem, all being out-of-doors, you must mind, and longing to have their\nturn at it. But I held myself above them always, and went back to my\nchildren.\n\n""These were in a little bower made up for the occasion, with boughs of\ntrees, and twisted wood, and moss from the forest to lie upon. Master\nPhilip was tired and heavy, and working his eyes with the backs of his\nhands, and yawning, and falling away almost. But that little Bertha was\nas wide-awake as a lark on her nest in the morning. Everywhere she was\nlooking about for somebody to encourage her to have \'more play,\' as she\nalways called for; and \'more play\' continually. That child was so full\nof life, it was \'more play\' all day long with her! And even now, in the\nfiery heat and thorough down thirst of the weather, nothing was further\nfrom her mind than to go to bed without a gambol for it. She had nothing\non but her little shift, or under-frock I should call it, made by\nmyself, when the hot weather came, from a new jemmyset of the Princess,\nand cut out by my lady to fit her for the sake of the coolness. Her\ngrand white upper frock, trimmed with lace, had been taken off by her\npapa, I believe, when the visitors would have her dance on the table,\nand make speeches to them; the poor little soul was so quick and so hot.\n\n""Well, I do declare to you, Captain Wells, and Charley, Polly likewise,\nwhich will believe me, though the men may not, it was not more than a\nminute or so much, perhaps I should say not half a minute, as I happened\nto turn round to pass a compliment with a young man as seemed struck\nwith me the Sunday before in church-time; a sailor he were, and had come\nwith the Captain, and was his mate of the pleasure-boat. A right down\nhandsome young man he was--no call for you to be jealous, Charley.\nBeneath the salt waves he do lie. Well, I turned back my head in about\nfive seconds, and both of the babes was gone out of my sight! At first I\nwere not frightened much. I took it for one of Miss Bertha\'s tricks, to\nmake off with her little brother. So strong she was on her legs, though\nlight, that many a time she would lift him up by his middle and carry\nhim half round the room, and then both of them break out laughing. \'I\'ll\nwhip you, you see if I don\'t,\' I cried, as I ran round the corner to\nseek for them; though whip them I never did, poor dears, any more than\ntheir own mother did. I ran all about, for five minutes at least, around\nand among the branches stuck in to make the bower, and every moment I\nmade up my mind for Miss Bardie to pop out on me. But pop out she never\ndid, nor will, until the day of judgment.\n\n""When I began to see something more than an innocent baby trick in it,\nand to think (I daresay) of these two babies\' value, with all the land\nthey were born to, the first thing I did was to call out \'Jack!\' such\nbeing all sailors\' names, of course. But Jack was gone out of all\nhearing; and most folk said it was Jack that took them! To the contrary\nI could swear; but who would listen to me when the lie went out that I\nwas quite tipsy?\n\n""Of the rest I cannot speak clearly, because my heart flew right up into\nmy brain, directly moment the people came round shouting at me for the\nchildren. And of these the very worst was Parson Chowne. If it had been\nhis own only children--such as he says he is too good to have--he\nscarcely could have been more rampagious, not to use worse words of him.\nThe first thing that every one ran to, of course, was the parapetch and\nthe river, and a great cry was made for Captain Drake Bampfylde, from\nhis knowledge of the waterways. But, though all the evening foremost in\nconducting everything, now there was no sign to be had of him, or of who\nhad seen him last. And it must have been an hour ere ever he come, and\nthen of course it was too late.\n\n""I was so beside myself all that night that I cannot tell how the time\nwent by. I remember looking over the parapetch at a place where the\nwater is always deep, and seeing the fishermen from the salmon-weir\ndragging their nets for the poor mites of bodies. And my blood seemed to\ncurdle inside me almost, every time they came out with a stone or a log.\nNothing was found from that night to this day, and nothing will ever be\nfound of it. I was discharged, and a great many others; not the first\ntime in this world, I believe, when the bottom of the whole was\nwitchcraft. Here, Charley, put something hot in my glass; the evenings\nare getting so dark; and I never can see the moon and the water, like\nthat, and the trees, without remembering. Now ask me no more, if you\nplease, good people.""\n\nWhen Mrs Shapland had finished this tale, and was taking some\nwell-earned refreshment, Polly and I looked at one another, as much as\nto say, ""That settles it."" Nor did we press her with any more questions\nuntil her mind had recovered its tone by frying some slices of ham cut\nthin, and half-a-dozen new-laid eggs for us. Then, I approached her with\nno small praise, which she deserved, and appeared (so far as I could\njudge) to desire, perhaps; and with a little skill on my part, she was\nsoon warmed up again, having tasted egg-flip, to be sure of it.\n\n""Yes, Captain Wells, you can see through the whole of it. Sailors can\nunderstand a river, when nobody else knows anything. The Captain came\nforward as soon as he could, and he says, \'You fools, what are you\nabout? An hour ago the tide was running five knots an hour where you be\ndragging! If the poor children fell over, they must be down river-bar by\nthis time.\' And off he set out on a galloping horse, to scurry the\nsandhills somehow. And scurry was now the whole of it. Sir Philip came\nforth, and that poor Squire Philip; and a thousand pounds was as freely\ntalked of as if it was halfpence. And every one was to be put in prison;\nespecially me, if you please, as blameless as the unborn babe was! And\nthat very night the Princess were taken, and died the next day,\nupsetting everything, ever so much worse than ever. For poor Squire\nPhilip fell into a trance, so to say, out of sheer vexation. He cried\nout that the hand of the Lord was upon him, and too heavy for him to\nbear--particular from his own brother. And after that not an inch would\nhe budge to make inquiry or anything, but shut himself up in his dead\nwife\'s rooms, and there he have moped from that day to this, in a living\ngrave, as you may call it.""\n\nIn reply to my question what reasons the Squire, or any one else, might\nhave for charging the Captain with so vile a deed, this excellent woman\nset them forth pretty much to the following purport. First, it was the\nCaptain himself who proposed the dancing on the terrace. Second, it was\nhis own man who drew her attention away from the children, after a\ngoblet of wine had been administered by the master. Third, it was his\nown boat which was missing, and never heard of afterwards. Fourth, the\nCaptain himself disappeared from the party at the very time that the\nchildren were stolen, and refused to say whither, or why, he was gone.\nThat active and shrewd man Parson Chowne no sooner heard of the loss\nthan he raised a cry for the Captain all over the terrace, to come and\ncommand the fishermen; and though as a friend of the family Chowne would\nnever express an opinion, he could not undo that sad shake of the head\nwhich he gave when no Captain could be found. Fifth, a man with a\nCaptain\'s hat was seen burying two small bodies that night, in the depth\nof Braunton Wilderness; though nothing was heard of it till the next\nweek, through the savageness of the witness; and by that time the fierce\nstorm on the Sunday had changed the whole face of the burrows, so that\nto find the spot was impossible. Sixth, it was now recalled to mind that\nDrake Bampfylde had killed a poor schoolfellow in his young days, for\nwhich the Lord had most righteously sent a shark in pursuit of him. It\nwas likely enough that he would go on killing children upon occasion.\nSeventh reason, and perhaps worth all the rest--only think what a motive\nhe had for it. No one else could gain sixpence by it; Drake Bampfylde\nwould gain everything--the succession to the title and estates, and the\nimmediate right to aspire to the hand of the beautiful heiress, Miss\nCarey, who was known to favour him.\n\nAn elderly woman, who had been in the workhouse, and throve upon that\nexperience, said that the Captain would never have done it; for he might\nhave to do the like thing again, every time the poor Princess should\nhappen to be confined almost. But who could listen to this poor\ncreature, while the result lay there before them?\n\nThus the common people reasoned; but our Susan attached no weight to any\nexcept the last argument. As for one, she knew quite well that the young\nseaman sauntered there quite by chance, and quite by chance she spoke to\nhim: and as for wine, she could take a quart of her father\'s cider, and\nfeel it less than she could describe to any one; and as for a rummer of\nthat stuff she had, it was quite below contempt to her. And concerning\nthe Captain just being away, and declining to say where he was, like a\ngentleman; none but ignorant folk could pretend not to know what that\nmeant. Of course he was gone, between the dances, for a little cool walk\nin the firwoods, together with his Isabel; and to expose her name to the\npublic, with their nasty way of regarding things, was utterly out of the\nquestion to a real British officer! And to finish it, Mrs Shapland said\nthat she was almost what you might call a young woman even now; at any\nrate with ten times the sense any of the young ones were up to. And ten\nyears of her life she would give, if Charley would allow of her, to know\nwhat became of them two little dears, and to punish the villain that\nwronged them.\n\nHereupon my warmth of heart got the better of my prudence. My wise and\npure intention was to get out of this good woman all I could; but impart\nto her nothing more than was needful, just to keep her talking.\nExperience shows us that this need be very little indeed, if anything,\nin a female dialogue. But now I was brought to such a pitch of\ntenderness by this time, with my heart in a rapid pulse of descriptions,\nand the egg-flip going round sturdily, also Polly looking at me in a\nmost beseeching way, that I could not keep my own counsel even, but was\ncompelled to increase their comfort by declaring every thing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nSO DOES POOR OLD DAVY.\n\n\nHereupon, you may well suppose that the grass must no longer grow under\nmy feet. With one man, and positively two women, in this very same\ncounty, having possession of my secret, how long could I hope to work\nthis latter to any good purpose? Luckily Burrington lay at a very great\ndistance from Nympton on the Moors, and with no road from one to the\nother; so that if Mr and Mrs Shapland should fail of keeping their\npromised tightness, at least two Barnstaple market-days must pass before\nNympton heard anything. And but for this consideration, even their style\nof treatment would not have made me so confiding.\n\nOn the following morn, while looking forth at pigs, and calves, and\ncocks, and ducks, I perceived that the crash must come speedily, and\nresolved to be downright smart with it. So after making a brisk little\nbreakfast, upon the two wings and two legs of a goose, grilled with a\ntrifle of stuffing, there was but one question I asked before leaving\nmany warm tears behind me.\n\n""Good Mistress Shapland, would you know that jemmyset of the child, if\nyou saw it?""\n\n""Captain Wells, I am not quite a natural. My own stitching done with a\nclub-head, all of it, and of a three-lined thread as my uncle\'s, and\nnobody else had, to Barnstaple. Likewise the mark of the Princess done,\na mannygram, as they call it.""\n\nThe weather was dull, and the time of year as stormy as any I know of:\nnevertheless it was quite fine now, and taking upon myself to risk five\nguineas out of my savings, Ilfracombe was the place I sought, and found\nit with some difficulty. Thus might Barnstaple bar be avoided, and all\nthe tumbling of inshore waters; and thus with no more than a pilot-yawl\ndid I cross that dangerous channel, at the most dangerous time of the\nyear almost. Nothing less than my Royal clothes and manifest high rank\nin the Navy could have induced this fine old pilot to make sail for the\nopposite coast in the month of November, when violent gales are so\ncommon with us. But I showed him two alternatives, three golden guineas\non the one hand, impressment on the other; for a press-gang was in the\nneighbourhood now, and I told him that I was its captain, and that we\nlaughed at all certificates. And not being sure that this man and his\nson might not combine to throw me overboard, steal my money, and run\nback to port, I took care to let them perceive my entry of their names\nand my own as well in the register of the coast-guard. However they\nproved very honest fellows, and we anchored under Porthcawl point soon\nafter dark that evening.\n\nHaving proved to the pilot that he was quite safe here, unless it should\ncome on to blow from south-east, of which there was no symptom, and\nleaving him under the care of Sandy, who at my expense stood treat to\nhim, I made off for Candleston, not even stopping for a chat with Roger\nBerkrolles. The Colonel, of course, as well as his sister Lady Bluett,\nand Rodney, wore delighted with what I had to tell them, while the maid\nherself listened with her face concealed to the tale of her own\nmisfortune. Once or twice she whispered to herself, ""Oh my poor poor\nfather!"" and when I had ended she rose from the sofa where Lady Bluett\'s\narm was around her, and went to the Colonel and said, ""How soon will you\ntake me to my father!""\n\n""My darling Bertha,"" said the Colonel, embracing her, as if she had been\nhis daughter, ""we will start to-morrow, if Llewellyn thinks the weather\nquite settled, and the boat quite safe. He knows so much about boats,\nyou see. It would take us a week to go round by land. But we won\'t start\nat all, if you cry, my dear!""\n\nI did not altogether like the tone of the Colonel\'s allusion to me;\nstill less was I pleased when he interrupted Lady Bluett\'s\ncongratulations, thanks, and fervent praises of my skill, perseverance,\nand trustiness in discovering all this villany.\n\n""Humph!"" said the Colonel; ""I am not quite sure that this villany would\nhave succeeded so long, unless a certain small boat had proved so\nadapted for fishing purposes.""\n\n""Why, Henry!"" cried his sister; ""how very unlike you! What an unworthy\ninsinuation! After all Mr Llewellyn has done; it is positively\nungrateful. And he spoke of that boat in this very room, as I can\nperfectly well remember, not--oh not--I am sure any more than a very few\nyears ago, my dear.""\n\n""Exactly,"" said the Colonel; ""too few years ago. If he had spoken of\nthat at the time, as distinctly as he did afterwards, when the heat of\ninquiry was over, and when Sir Philip himself had abandoned it, I do\nnot see how all this confusion, between the loss of a foreign ship and\nthe casting away of a British boat, could have arisen, or at any rate\ncould have failed to be cleared away. Llewellyn, you know that I do not\njudge hastily. Sir, I condemn your conduct.""\n\n""Oh, Colonel, how dreadful of you! Mr Llewellyn, go and look at the\nweather, while I prove to the Colonel his great mistake. You did speak\nof the boat at the very inquest, in the most noble and positive manner;\nand nobody would believe you, as you your very self told me. What more\ncould any man do? We are none of us safe, if we do our very best, and\nhave it turned against us.""\n\nMy conscience all this time was beating, so that I could hear it. This\nis a gift very good men have, and I have made a point of never failing\nto cultivate it. In this trying moment, with even a man so kind and\nblameless suddenly possessed, no doubt, by an evil spirit against me,\nstanch as rock my conscience stood, and to my support it rose,\ncreditably for both of us.\n\n""Colonel Lougher,"" my answer was, ""you will regret this attack on the\nhonour of a British officer. One, moreover, whose great-grandfather\nharped in your Honour\'s family. Captain Bluett understands the build of\na boat as well as I do. He shall look at that boat to-morrow morning,\nand if he declares her to be English-built, you may set me down, with\nall my stripes and medals, for a rogue, sir. But if he confirms my\nsurety of her being a foreigner, nothing but difference of rank will\nexcuse you, Colonel Lougher, from being responsible to me.""\n\nMy spirit was up, as you may see; and the honour of the British Navy\nforced me to speak strongly: although my affection for the man was such\nthat sooner than offend him, I would have my other arm shot away.\n\n""Llewellyn,"" said the Colonel, with his fine old smile spreading very\npleasantly upon his noble countenance; ""you are of the peppery order\nwhich your old Welsh blood produces. Think no more of my words for the\npresent. And if my nephew agrees with you in pronouncing the boat a\nforeigner, I will give you full satisfaction by asking your pardon,\nLlewellyn. It was enough to mislead any man.""\n\nNot to dwell upon this mistake committed by so good a man, but which got\nabroad somehow--though my old friend Crumpy, I am sure, could never have\nbeen listening at the door--be it enough in this hurry to say, that on\nthe next morning I was enabled to certify the weather. A smartish\nbreeze from the north-north-west, with the sea rather dancing than\nrunning, took poor Bardie to her native coast, from which the hot tide\nhad borne her. Before we set sail, I had been to Sker in Colonel\nLougher\'s two-wheeled gig, and obtained from good Moxy the child\'s\njemmyset from the old oak chest it was stored in.\n\nAnd now I did a thing which must for ever acquit me of all blame so\nwrongfully cast upon me. That is to say, I fetched out the old boat,\nwhich Sandy Macraw had got covered up; and releasing him in the most\ngenerous manner from years and years of backrent, what did I do but\nhitch her on to the stern of the pilot-yawl, for to tow? Not only this,\nbut I managed that Rodney should sail on board as her skipper, and for\nhis crew should have somebody who had crossed the channel before in that\nsame poor and worthless boat, sixteen years agone, I do declare! And\nthey did carry on a bit, now and then, when our sprit-sail hid them from\nour view. For the day was bright, and the sea was smooth.\n\nThe Colonel and I were on board of the yawl, enjoying perfect harmony.\nFor Captain Rodney of course had confirmed my opinion as to the build of\nthe boat, and his uncle desired to beg my pardon, which the largeness of\nmy nature quite refused to hear of. If a man admits that he has wronged\nme, satisfied I am at once, and do not even point out always, that I\nnever could have done the like to him.\n\nColonel Lougher had often been at sea, in the time of his active\nservice, and he seemed to enjoy this trip across channel, and knew all\nthe names of the sails and spars. But falling in as we did with no less\nthan three or four small craft on our voyage, he asked me how Delushy\'s\nboat could possibly have been adrift for a whole night and day on the\nchannel, without any ship even sighting her. I told him that this was as\nsimple as could be, during that state of the weather. A burning haze, or\nsteam from the land, lay all that time on the water; and the lower part\nthereof was white, while the upper spread was yellow. Also the sea\nitself was white from the long-continued calmness, so that a white boat\nscarcely would show at half a mile of distance. And even if it did, what\nsailors were likely to keep a smart look-out in such roasting weather?\nMen talk of the heat ashore sometimes; but I know that for downright\nsmiting, blinding, and overwhelming sun-power, there is nothing ashore\nto compare with a ship.\n\nAlso I told the Colonel, now that his faith in me was re-established,\ngliding over the water thus, I was enabled to make plain to him things\nwhich if he had been ashore might have lain perhaps a little beyond his\nunderstanding. I showed him the set of the tides by tossing corks from\nhis bottles overboard, and begging him to take a glass of my perspective\nto watch them. And he took such interest in this, and evinced so much\nsagacity, that in order to carry on my reasoning with any perspicacity,\ncork after cork I was forced to draw, to establish my veracity.\n\nBecause he would argue it out that a boat, unmanned and even unmasted,\nnever could have crossed the channel as Bardie\'s boat must needs have\ndone. I answered that I might have thought so also, and had done so for\nyears and years, till there came the fact to the contrary; of which I\nwas pretty well satisfied now; and when the boat was produced and sworn\nto, who would not be satisfied? Also I begged to remind him how strongly\nthe tide ran in our channel, and that even in common weather the ebb of\nthe spring out of Barnstaple river might safely be put at four knots an\nhour, till Hartland point was doubled. Here, about two in the morning,\nthe flood would catch the little wanderer, and run her up channel some\nten or twelve miles, with the night-wind on the starboard-beam driving\nher also northward. When this was exhausted, the ebb would take her into\nSwansea Bay almost, being so light a boat as she was, with a southern\nbreeze prevailing. And then the next flood might well bring her to\nSker,--exactly the thing that had come to pass. Moreover I thought, as I\ntold the Colonel (although of course with diffidence), from long\nacquaintance with tropical waters and the power of the sun upon them, I\nthought it by no means unlikely that the intense heat of the weather,\nthen for more than six weeks prevailing, might have had some strong\neffect on the set and the speed of the currents.\n\nHowever, no more of arguments. What good can they do, when the thing is\nthere, and no reasoning can alter it? Even Parson Chowne might argue,\nand no doubt would with himself (although too proud with other people),\nthat all he did was right, and himself as good a man as need be.\n\nWe ran across channel in some six hours, having a nice breeze abaft the\nbeam, and about the middle of the afternoon we landed at Ilfracombe\ncleverly. This is a little place lying in a hole, and with great rocks\nall around it, fair enough to look at, but more easy to fall down than\nto get up them. And even the Barnstaple road is so steep that the first\nhill takes nearly two hours of climbing. Therefore, in spite of all\neager spirits, we found ourselves forced to stay there that night, for\nno one would horse us onwards, so late at this November season.\n\nPerhaps, however, it was worth while to lose a few hours for the sake of\nseeing Delushy\'s joy in her native land. This, like a newly-opened\nspring, arose, and could not contain itself. As soon as her foot touched\nthe shore, I began to look forward to a bout of it. For I understand\nyoung women now, very well, though the middle-aged are beyond me. These\nlatter I hope to be up to, if ever I live to the age of fourscore years,\nas my constitution promises. And if the Lord should be pleased to\npromote me to the ripe and honest century (as was done to my\ngreat-grandfather), then I shall understand old women also, though\nperhaps without teeth to express it.\n\nHowever this was a pretty thing, and it touched me very softly. None but\nthose who have roamed as I have understand the heart-ache. For my native\nland I had it, ever and continually, and in the roar of battle I was\nborne up by discharging it. And so I could enter into our poor Bardie,\ngoing about with the tears in her eyes. For she would not allow me to\nrest at the inn, as I was fain to do in the society of some ancient\nfishermen, and to leave the gentlefolk to their own manner of getting\nthrough the evening.\n\n""Come out,"" she cried, ""old Davy; you are the only one that knows the\nway about this lovely place.""\n\nOf course I had no choice but to obey Sir Philip\'s own granddaughter,\nalthough I could not help grumbling; and thus we began to explore a lane\nas crooked as a corkscrew, and with ferns like palm-trees feathering. In\namong them little trickling rills of water tinkled, or were hushed\nsometimes by moss, and it looked as if no frost could enter through the\nleafy screen above.\n\n""What a country to be born in! What a country to belong to!"" exclaimed\nthe maid continually, sipping from each crystal runnel, and stroking the\nferns with reverence. ""Uncle Henry, don\'t you think now that it is\nenough to make one happy to belong to such a land?""\n\n""Well, my dear,"" said her Uncle Henry, as she had been ordered to call\nthe Colonel, ""I think it would still more conduce to happiness for some\nof the land to belong to you. Ah, Llewellyn, I see, is of my opinion.""\n\nSo I was, and still more so next day, when, having surmounted that\nterrible hill, we travelled down rich dairy valleys on our road to\nBarnstaple. Here we halted for refreshment, and to let Delushy rest and\nbeautify herself, although we could see no need of that. And now she\nbegan to get so frightened that I was quite vexed with her: her first\nduty was to do me credit; and how could she manage it, if her eyes were\nred? The Colonel also began to provoke me, for when I wanted to give the\nmaid a stiff glass of grog to steady her, he had no more sense than to\ncountermand it, and order a glass of cold water!\n\nAs soon as we came to Narnton Court, we found a very smart coach in the\nyard, that quite put to shame our hired chaise, although the good\nColonel had taken four horses, so as to land us in moderate style. Of\ncourse it was proper that I, who alone could claim Sir Philip\'s\nacquaintance, as well as the merit of the whole affair, should have the\npleasure of introducing his new grandchild to him; so that I begged all\nthe rest to withdraw, and the only names that we sent in, were Captain\nLlewellyn and ""Miss Delushy."" Therefore we were wrong, no doubt, in\nfeeling first a little grievance, then a large-minded impatience, and\nfinally a strong desire--ay, and not the desire alone--to swear, before\nwe got out of it. I speak of myself and Captain Bluett, two good honest\nsailors, accustomed to declare their meaning since the war enabled them.\nBut Colonel Lougher (who might be said, from his want of active service,\nto belong to a past generation), as well as Delushy, who was scarcely\ncome into any generation yet,--these two really set an example, good,\nthough hard, to follow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nTHE MAID AT LAST IS ""DENTIFIED.""\n\n\nHowever, as too often happens, we blamed a good man without cause. A\ngood man rarely deserves much blame; whereas a bad man cannot have too\nmuch--whether he has earned it or otherwise--to restrain him from\ndeserving more. The reason why Sir Philip Bampfylde kept us so long\nwaiting, proved to be a sound and valid one; namely, that he was engaged\nin earnest and important converse with his daughter-in-law, Lady\nBampfylde, now wife (if you will please to remember) to Commodore Sir\nDrake Bampfylde, although by birth entitled the Honourable Isabel\nCarey, the one that had been so good to me when I was a ferryman; of\nsuperior order, certainly; but still, no more than a ferryman!\n\nSince my rise in the world began, I have found out one satisfactory\nthing--that a man gets on by merit. How long did I despair of this, and\nsmoke pipes, and think over it; seeing many of my friends advancing, by\nwhat I call roguery! And but for the war (which proves the hearts and\nreins of men, as my ancestor says), I might still have been high and\ndry, being too honest for the fish-trade. However, true merit will tell\nin the end, if a man contrives to live long enough.\n\nSo when the beautiful lady came out through the room where I sate\nwaiting, as I touched my venerable forelock to her (as humbly as if for\na sixpenny piece), a brave man\'s honest pride wrought weakness in my\neyes, as I gazed at her. I loved her husband; and I loved her; and I\nthought of the bitter luck between them, which had kept them separate.\nPartly, of course, the glory of England, and duty of a proud man\'s\nbirth; partly also bad luck of course, and a style of giving in to it;\nbut ten times more than these, the tricks that lower our\nfellow-creatures.\n\nThis noble and stately lady did not at first sight recognise me; but\nwhen I had told her in very few words who I was, and what I had done,\nand how long I had sailed with her husband, and how highly he respected\nme, her eyes brightened into the old sweet smile, although they bore\ntraces of weeping.\n\n""My name is not \'Lady Carey,\'"" she said, for I was calling her thus on\npurpose, not knowing how she was taking wedlock, and being of opinion\nthat an ""honourable miss"" ought always to be called a lady. ""My name is\n\'Lady Bampfylde;\' and I like it, if you please: although I remember, Mr\nLlewellyn, what your views are of matrimony. You used to declare them\nonly too plainly, whenever we crossed your ferry, for the purpose, as I\nused to think, of driving poor Nanette to despair of you.""\n\n""And a lucky thing for me, your ladyship, to have acted so consistently.\nBut his Honour the Commodore, of course, holds the opposite opinion.""\n\n""It is hard to guess the opinions of a commodore always on service. Sir\nDrake, as I daresay you have heard, can scarcely bear to come home now.""\n\nI saw that she was vexed by something, and also vexed with herself,\nperhaps, for having even hinted it. For she turned her beautiful face\naway, and without a word would have left me. But with my usual\nquickness of step, I ran into the lobby-place, and back in a moment with\nour Delushy, clinging like a woodbine to a post. At such moments, I\nnever speak, until women begin with questions. It saves so much time to\nlet them begin; because they are sure to insist on it. Meanwhile Delushy\nwas making the prettiest curtsy that presence of mind permitted.\n\n""You lovely dear, why, who are you?"" cried Lady Bampfylde, with a start,\nthat made me dread hysterics.\n\n""I do not know, Madam,"" answered Delushy, with the whole of her mind so\nwell in hand, by reason of years of suffering; ""but many people believe\nme to be the Bertha Bampfylde that was lost, nearly twenty years agone.""\n\n""What! The baby! The baby--at least one of the babies--that my\nhusband--David Llewellyn, this is very cruel of you.""\n\nAnd that was all the thanks I got! While, what could I have done\notherwise? In five minutes more, she would have been off in her grand\ncoach with six horses, after offending Sir Philip so much, that he could\nnot have borne to look after her; although, of course, he was now coming\nout like a gentleman to a visitor. Seeing such a pay-night coming, and a\nlarge confusion, I begged Colonel Lougher and Captain Bluett to keep for\na little while out of it. And nothing could more truly prove how\nthoroughly these were gentlemen, than that they withdrew to a niche of\nthe under-butler\'s pantry, wherein they could hear no word of it.\n\nIt was now my place to stand forward bravely, and to put things clearly;\nwithout any further loss of reason, and even without considering how\nthese delicate ladies might contrive to take my meaning nicely. To spare\ngood ladies from any emotion, is one of the main things of my life;\nalthough they show such a want of gratitude, when I have done my utmost.\n\nBut as for frightening Sir Philip, of course, I had no scruple about\nthat; because of his confidence in the Lord. Therefore, abandoning Lady\nBampfylde to the care of her maid, who was running up from the servants\'\nhall to look after her, I fixed my hook (screwed on for the purpose)\nfirmly into Delushy\'s sleeve, that she might not faint, or run away, or\ndo anything else unreasonable, and I led her up the long hall to meet\nSir Philip, as he came down the steps at the upper end thereof.\n\nThe old General looked rather haggard and feeble, as if the power of his\nlife were lowered by perpetual patience. But something had happened to\nvex him, no doubt, in his interview with Lady Bampfylde, so that he\nwalked with more than his usual stateliness and dignity. He had never\nbeheld me as a one-armed man, nor yet in my present uniform, for I took\nparticular care to avoid him during the day or two spent at his house\nbefore I went to Burrington, so for a moment he did not know me, but\ngazed with surprise at the lovely figure which I was sustaining so\nclumsily.\n\n""Sir Philip Bampfylde, allow me,"" I said, stretching forth my right hand\nto him, ""to repay you for some of the countless benefits you have heaped\nupon me, by presenting you with your long-lost granddaughter--and your\ngrandson to come afterwards.""\n\n""It cannot be; it cannot be,"" was all he could say, although for so many\nyears he had shown his faith that it must be. His fine old countenance\nturned as white as the silver hair that crowned it, and then as red as\nit could have been in the hopeful blush of boyhood. And the pure and\nperfect delicacy of high birth quickened with sorrow prevented him from\nexamining Delushy, as he longed to do.\n\n""Speak up, child, speak up,"" said I, giving her a haul with my hook, as\nwhen first I landed her; ""can\'t you tell your dear Grandfather how glad\nyou are to see him?""\n\n""That I will with all my heart,"" the maiden answered bashfully, yet\nlifting her eyes to the old man\'s face with pride as well as reverence;\n""as soon as I perceive that you, sir, wish to hear me say it.""\n\n""You will not think me rude--I am scarcely strong enough for this--it\nhas come on me so suddenly. And it must be quite as bad for you. Lead\nthe young lady to a chair, Llewellyn. Or, stay; I beg your pardon. It\nwill perhaps be better to call our kind and worthy housekeeper.""\n\nSir Philip perceived a thing which had escaped me, though brought to my\nnotice beforehand by our good Colonel Lougher; that is to say, how hard\nit would be upon the feelings of this young girl, to have her ""identity""\n(as Crowner Bowles entitled it) discussed in her own presence. Therefore\nshe was led away by that regular busybody the housekeeper, Mrs\nCockhanterbury; while I begged leave to introduce Colonel Lougher and\nCaptain Bluett to Sir Philip Bampfylde. And then when all had made their\nbows and all due salutations, I was called upon to show my documents and\nexplain the evidence so carefully gathered by me.\n\nIt is as much above my power, as beyond my purpose, to tell how that\nancient and noble gentleman, after so much worry from the long neglect\nof Providence, took (as if he had never deserved it) this goodness of\nthe Lord to him. Of course, in my class of life, we cannot be always\ndwelling on children; whose nature is provoking always, and in nothing\nmore so than that they will come when not wanted; yet are not\nforthcoming with the folk who can afford them. Nevertheless, I think\nthat if the Lord had allowed any thief of a fellow (much more one of His\nown ministers) to steal two grandchildren of mine, and make a savage of\none baby, and of the other a castaway, the whole of my piety would have\nbeen very hard pushed to produce any gratitude. Sir Philip, however, did\nappear most truly desirous to thank God for this great mercy vouchsafed\nto him; even before he had thoroughly gone through the ins and outs of\nthe evidence. For he begged us to excuse him, while he should go to see\nto our comfort; and two fine bottles of wine (white and red) appeared,\nand began to disappear, under my hatches mainly, before our noble host\ncame back to set us a good example. And when he came he had quite\nforgotten to dust the knees of some fine kerseymere, and the shins of\nblack silk stockings.\n\nDeep sense of religion is quite in its place when a man has had one arm\nshot off, still more so if both arms are gone, and after a leg,\nindispensable. Nevertheless it must not be intruded upon any one; no,\nnot even by the chaplain, till the doctor shakes his head. Knowing also\nthat Colonel Lougher had a tendency towards it (enough to stop the\ndecanters if he should get upon that subject with the arguments it\nsticks fast in), I was delighted to see Delushy slipping into the room\nas if she had known the place for a century. The General clearly had\nmanaged to visit her during the time of his absence from us; what passed\nbetween them matters not, except that he must have acknowledged her. For\nnow she went up to him and kissed him; rather timidly, perhaps, but\nstill she touched his forehead. Then he arose and stood very upright, as\nif he had never begun to stoop, and passing his arm round her delicate\nwaist, both her hands he took in his. And as they faced us, we were\nstruck with the likeness between blooming youth and worn but yet\nmajestic age.\n\n""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""or rather I should call you kind good friends,\nyou have brought me not only a grandchild, but the very one I would have\nchosen if the whole world gave me choice. By-and-by you shall see her\nstand by the picture of my dear and long-lamented wife. That, I think,\nwill convince you that we want no further evidence. For me, these\nthumb-nails are enough. Bertha, show your thumb-nails.""\n\nShe laughed her usual merry laugh (although she had been crying so)\nwhile she spread her dainty hands, exactly as she used to spread them,\nwhen she was only two years old, with me alone to look at her.\n\n""Here it is, sir,"" cried the General, overlooking me, in the rush of his\nsentiments towards the Colonel: ""here is the true Bampfylde mark. Even\nthe Bassets have it not, nor the Traceys, nor the St Albyns. Will you\noblige me by observing that these two thumb-nails have a most undoubted\nright and left to them? Bertha, do try to keep still for a moment.""\n\n""Well, I declare,"" said the Colonel, calmly taking out his eye-glass;\n""yes, I declare you are right, my good sir. Here is a most evident right\nand left--Andalusia, do stand still--not only in the half-moons at the\nbase, but in the vein, and what I may call the radiants of the pinkness.\nI cannot express my meaning, but--my darling, come and kiss me.""\n\nThis Delushy did at once, as for years she used to do; and not being\ncertain even now whether she ought to forsake the Colonel for a General,\nthough proved to be a very fine and newly-turned up Grandfather. None of\nus had thought of her, and the many shifts of female wind, coming to\npass perhaps inside her little brain and heart so. Wherefore this poor\nDavid, who desires always to be the last, but by force of nature is\ncompelled for ever to take the lead--I it was who got her off to bed,\nthat we might talk of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nDOG EATS DOG.\n\n\nTo a man, whose time of life begins to be a subject of some\nconsideration to him, when the few years still in hope can be counted on\na hand, and may not need a finger; and with the tide of this world\nebbing to the inevitable sea--to him there is scarcely any sweet and\ngentle pastime more delightful than to sit on a bank of ancient moss,\nbeside a tidal river, and watch the decreasing waters, and prove his\nown eternity by casting a pebble into them.\n\nHence it was that Sir Philip Bampfylde, on the very morning after I gave\nhim back his grandchild, sate gazing into the ebb of the Tawe, some\nfifty yards below the spot, whence Jack Wildman\'s father carried off so\nwickedly that helpless pair of children. Here it was my privilege to\ncome up to Sir Philip, and spread before him my humble reasons for\nhaving preferred the kitchen last night to the dining-room and the\ndrawing-room. It was consistent with my nature; and he, though wishing\notherwise, agreed not to be offended.\n\nThen I asked him how the young lady (whose health every one of us had\nhonoured, all over the kitchen-table) had contrived to pass the night,\nand whether she had seen her father yet. He said she had slept pretty\nwell considering, but that as concerned her father, they had not thought\nit wise to let her see him, until the doctor came. There was no telling\nhow it might act upon Squire Philip\'s constitution, after so many years\nof misery, cobwebs, and desolation. For Providence had not gifted him\nwith a mind so strong as his father\'s was, and the sudden break in on\nthe death of the mind has been known, in such a case, to lead to bodily\ndecease. But few things vexed the General more than that wretched lie of\nChowne\'s, and slander upon a loyal family while in service of the Crown.\nWhat Captain Drake had landed from the boat was not an arm-chest, but a\nchest of plate and linen, belonging to his brother, which he would no\nlonger borrow, while the Squire so cruelly dealt with him.\n\nThen I asked Sir Philip whether the ancient builder over at Appledore\nhad been sent for to depose to the boat; for we had brought that little\ncraft on the top of our coach from Ilfracombe. The General said that I\nmight see him even now examining her, if I would only take the trouble\nto look round the corner; but he himself was so well convinced, without\nany further testimony, that he did not even care to hear what the old\nman had to say of it, any more than he cared for the jemmyset. This,\nhowever, is not my manner of regarding questions. Not from any private\nfountains of conviction, and so on, but out of the mouths of many\nwitnesses shall a thing be established. Therefore I hastened round the\ncorner, to sift this ancient boatwright.\n\nAs surly a fellow as ever lived, and from his repugnance to my uniform,\none who had made more money, I doubt, by the smuggler\'s keg than the\nshipwright\'s adze. Entering into his nature at sight, I took the upper\nhand of him, as my rank insisted on.\n\n""Hark ye now, master ship-carpenter, where was this little craft put\ntogether, according to your opinion?""\n\nEither this fellow was deaf as a post, or else he meant to insult me,\nfor he took no more notice of me than he did of the pigs that were\nsnuffling at beech-nuts down by the side of the landing-place. I am not\nthe right man to put up with insolence; therefore I screwed my\nhammer-head into the socket below my muscles, and therewith dealt him a\ntap on his hat, just to show what might come afterwards.\n\nReceiving this administration, and seeing that more was very likely from\nthe same source to be available, what did this rogue do but endeavour to\nshow the best side of his manners. Wherefore, to let him have his say,\nhere is his opinion.\n\n""This here boat be the same as I built, year as my wife were took with\nquinzy, and were called home by the Lord. I built her for Wild-duck of\nAppledore, a little dandy-rigged craft as used to be hired by Cap\'en\nBampfylde. To this here boat I can swear, although some big rogue have\nbeen at work, painting her, as knew not how to paint; and a lubber, no\ndoubt, every now and then patching her up, or repairing of her. The name\nin her stern have been painted up from \'Wild-duck, Appledore,\' into\n\'Santa Lucia, Salvador;\' three or four letters are my own, the rest are\nthe work of some pirate. She be no more foreign-build than I be. But a\nsailor accustomed to foreign parts would be sure to reckon so, reason\nwhy I served my time with a builder over to Port-au-Prince. And I should\nlike to see the man anywhere round these here parts, as can tuck in the\nbends as I does.""\n\nLeaving this conceited fellow to his narrow unpleasantness, I turned my\nhead, and there beheld Captain Bluett harkening.\n\n""Come,"" he cried out, in his hearty manner, ""what a cook\'s boiling of\nfools we are! Here we are chewing a long-chewed quid, while the devil\nthat brewed this gale of wind may fly far away, and grin at us.\nLlewellyn, do you mean to allow----""\n\n""Hush,"" I said softly, for that low shipwright showed his eyes coming up\nunder his cap. And I saw that he was that particular villain, after his\nscurrilous words about me, who would sell his soul to that wretch of a\nChowne for half-a-crown a-week almost. Therefore I led our young Captain\nBluett well away out of this fellow\'s hearing.\n\n""Davy,"" said he, ""we all know your courage, your readiness, and your\nresources. Still you appear to be under a spell--and you know you are\nsuperstitious about this cunning and cowardly blackguard, who frightens\nthe whole of this country, as he never could frighten Glamorganshire.""\n\n""I have no fear of him, sir,"" I said; ""I will go with you to confront\nhim.""\n\n""Why, your teeth are ready to chatter, Llewellyn; and your lips are\nblue! You who stood like a mile-stone, they tell me, at the helm of the\nGoliath, or like a clock going steadily tick, before we fired a shot,\nand with both shell and shot through your grey whiskers----""\n\n""But, Captain, a minister of the Lord----""\n\n""Master, a minister of the devil--once for all, to-day I go to horsewhip\nhim, if he is young enough; or to pull his nose if he is old enough, and\nOld Harry be with him in choice of the two? Zounds, sir, is it a thing\nto laugh at?""\n\nRodney Bluett was well known to every one who served under him for the\nmildness of his language, and the want of oaths he had; and so, of\ncourse, for his self-control, and the power of his heart when it did\nbreak forth. Everybody loved him because he never cursed any one at a\nventure, and kept himself very close to facts, however hard driven by\ncircumstances; so that I was now amazed to hear this young man spoil my\npipe with violent emotions.\n\n""Have you consulted Sir Philip?"" I asked. ""It is his place to take up\nthe question.""\n\n""What question? There is no question. The thing is proved. My duty is\nplain. Sir Philip is too old to see to it. The Squire is a spooney. The\nCommodore is not here yet. I have spoken to his wife, who is a very\nsweet and wise lady; and she agrees with me that it will save the family\na world of scandal; and perhaps failure of the law, for me to take the\nlaw into my own hands, and thrash this blackguard within an inch of his\nlife.""\n\n""To be sure, and save her husband from the risk of tackling a desperate\nman. It is most wise on her part. But I beg you, my dear sir, for the\nsake of your dear uncle and your good mother, keep clear of this\nquarrel. You know not the man you have to deal with. Even if you can\nthrash him, which is no easy business, he will shoot you afterwards. He\nis the deadest shot in the county.""\n\n""Hurrah!"" cried Rodney, tossing up his hat; ""that entirely settles it.\nCome along, old fellow, and show us the way: and not a word to any one.""\n\nNow this may seem a very mad resolve for a man of my sense to give into.\nBut whether I turned myself this way or that, I could see no chance of\nbettering it. If I refused to go, young Rodney (as I could see by the\nset of his mouth) would go alone, and perhaps get killed, and then how\ncould any of the family ever look at me again? On the other hand, if I\nshould go to the Colonel, or to the General, for opinion, and to beg\nthem to stop it, my interference--nine chances to one--would only end in\ngiving offence among the superior orders. Add to this my real desire to\nsquare it out with Chowne himself, after all his persecution, and you\nmay be able to forgive me for getting upon horseback, after many years\nof forbearance, and with my sugar-nippers screwed on, to lay hold by the\nforestay, if she should make bad weather. Also, I felt it my duty to\ntake a double-barrelled pistol, heavily loaded and well primed.\n\nCaptain Rodney forged ahead so on a real hunting-craft, that my dappled\ngrey, being warranted not to lurch me overboard, could not keep in line\nwhatever sail I made upon her. My chief rule in life is not to hurry.\nWhat good ever comes of it? People only abuse you, and your breath is\ntoo short to answer them. Moreover, I felt an uneasy creaking in my\nbends from dousing forward, and then easing backward, as a man must do\nwho knows how to ride. The Captain was wroth with me, out of all reason;\nbut as he could not find the way to Nympton Moors without me, I was\nenabled to take my leisure, having the surety of overgetting him when\nthe next cross-road came. Therefore it was late afternoon when we turned\ninto the black fir-grove which led up to the house of Chowne, and Rodney\nBluett clutched the big whip in his hand severely. For we had asked at\nthe little inn of which I spoke a long time ago, whether the Parson was\nnow at home.\n\n""Ay, that \'un be,"" said the man with a grin, for we did not see the\nlandlady; ""but ye best way not to go nigh \'un.""\n\nAlready I seemed not to feel as I hoped, in the earlier stage of the\njourney. My thoughts had been very upright for a while, and spirited,\nand delighted; but now I began to look at things from a different point\nof view almost. It is not man\'s business to worry his head about\nrighting of wrongs in this world, unless they are done to himself; and\nif so, revenge is its name, and an ugly one. Long life leads one to\nforgive, when to carry it on would be troublesome.\n\nThrough the drip of dying leaves, the chill of dull November now began\nto darken over us as we turned the corner of Chowne\'s own road, and\nfaced his lonely mansion. The house had a heavy and sullen look,\naccording to my ideas, not receiving light and pleasure of the sun when\npossible. Heavy fir-trees overhung it, never parting with their weight;\nand the sunset (when there was any) could not pierce the holm-oaks.\n\n""What a gloomy and devilish place!"" cried Rodney Bluett, beginning to\ntremble from some unknown influence. ""Upon my soul, if I lived here, I\nshould be hatching plots myself. Or is it the nature of the man that has\nmade the place so horrible?""\n\n""Let us go back,"" said I; ""come back, my good sir, I conjure you. Such a\nman should be left to God, to punish in His own good time.""\n\n""Hark!"" cried Rodney, pulling up, and listening through the gloomy wood;\n""that was a woman\'s scream, I am sure. Is he murdering some more little\nones?""\n\nWe listened, and heard a loud piercing shriek, that made our hair stand\non end almost, so mad was it, and so unearthly; and then two more of yet\nwilder agony; and after that a long low wailing.\n\n""On, on!"" cried Rodney Bluett; ""you know these paths, gallop on, Davy.""\n\n""You go first,"" I answered; ""your horse is fresher; I am coming--to be\nsure I am--do you think I am frightened?""\n\n""Well, I don\'t know,"" he replied; ""but I am not ashamed to own that I\nam.""\n\nClapping spurs to his horse, he dashed on; and thoroughly miserable as I\nfelt, there was nothing for me but to follow him.\n\nIn the name of the Lord, what a sight we came on, where the drive sweeps\nround at the corner of the house! Under a dark tree of some sort, and on\na garden bench, we discovered the figures of two women. Or rather, one\nsate on the bench; the other lay stretched on the ground, with her head\ncast recklessly back on the ledge, her hair spread in masses over it,\nand both hands pressed on her eyes and ears, to shut out sight and\nhearing. Her lips were open, and through her white teeth came wails of\nanguish, that would have been shrieks, if nature had not failed her.\n\nBut the elder woman sate upright, in scorn of all such weakness, with\nher gaunt figure drawn like a cable taut, no sign of a tear on her\nshrunken cheeks, and the whole of her face as numb and cold as an iced\nfigure-head in the Arctic seas. Yet no one, with knowledge of the human\nrace, could doubt which of these two suffered most.\n\nWe reined up our horses, and gazed in terror, for neither of them\nnoticed us; and then we heard, from inside the house, sounds that made\nour flesh creep. Barking, howling, snapping of teeth, baying as of a\nhuman bloodhound, frothy splutterings of fury, and then smothered\nyelling.\n\n""Her have a gat \'un now,"" cried a clown, running round the end of the\nhouse, as if he were enjoying it. ""Reckon our passon wun\'t baite much\nmoore, after Passon Jack be atop of \'un.""\n\n""Oh sir, oh sir, oh for God\'s sake, sir,"" cried the poor lady who had\nlain on the ground, rushing up to us, and kneeling, and trying to get\nhold of us; ""you must have come to stop it, sir. Only one hour--allow\nhim one hour, dear, dear sirs, for repentance. He has not been a good\nman, I know, but I am his own wife, good kind sirs--and if he could only\nhave a little time, if it were only half an hour--he might, he\nmight----""\n\nHere a sound of throttling came through a broken windowpane, and down\nshe fell insensible.\n\n""What does it mean?"" cried Rodney Bluett; ""is it murder, madness, or\nsuicide? Follow me, Davy. Here I go, anyhow, into the thick of it.""\n\nHe dashed through the window; and I with more caution, cocking my\npistol, followed him, while I heard the clown shouting after us--\n\n""Danged vules both of \'e. Bide outside, bide outside, I tell \'e.""\n\nOh that we had remained outside! I have been through a great deal of\nhorrible sights, enough to harden any man, and cure him of womanly\nsqueamishness. Yet never did I behold, or dream of, anything so awful as\nthe scene that lay before me. People were longing to look at it now, but\nnone (save ourselves) durst enter.\n\nIt was Chowne\'s own dining-room, all in the dark, except where a lamp\nhad been brought in by a trembling footman, who ran away, knowing that\nhe brought this light for his master to be strangled by. And in the\ncorner now lay his master, smothered under a feather-bed; yet with his\nvicious head fetched out in the last rabid struggle to bite. There was\nthe black hair, black face, and black tongue, shown by the frothy\nwainscot, or between it and the ticking. On the feather-bed lay\nexhausted, and with his mighty frame convulsed, so that a child might\nmaster him, Parson Jack Rambone, the strongest man, whose strength (like\nall other powers) had laid a horrible duty upon him. Sobbing with all\nhis great heart he lay, yet afraid to take his weight off, and sweating\nat every pore with labour, peril of his life, and agony.\n\n""Oh Dick, Dick,"" he said, quite softly, and between his pantings; ""how\nmany larks have we had together, and for me to have to do this to you! I\nam sure you knew me, before you died. I think you know me now, Dick. Oh,\nfor God\'s sake, shut your eyes! Darling Dick, are you dead, are you\ndead? You are the very cleverest fellow ever I came across of. You can\ndo it, if you like. Oh, dear Dick, Dick, my boy, do shut your eyes!""\n\nWe stood looking at them, with no power to go up to them; all experience\nfailed us as to what was the proper thing to do, till I saw that\nChowne\'s face ought to have a napkin over it. None had been laid for\ndinner; but I knew where butlers keep them.\n\nWhen I had done this, Parson Jack (who could not escape from the great\nblack eyes) arose, and said, ""I thank you, sir."" He staggered so that we\nhad to support him; but not a word could we say to him. ""I am bitten in\ntwo places, if not more,"" he rather gasped than said to us, as he laid\nbare his enormous arms. ""I care not much. I will follow my friend. Or if\nthe Lord should please to spare me, henceforth I am an altered man. And\nyet, for the sake of my family, will you heat the kitchen poker?""\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nTHE OLD PITCHER AT THE WELL AGAIN.\n\n\nIt helps a thoughtless man on his road towards a better kingdom, to get\na glimpse, every now and then, of such visitations of the Lord. When I\nwas a little boy, nothing did me so much good in almost all the Bible,\nas to hear my father read the way in which Herod was eaten of worms. And\nnow in mature years, I received quite a serious turn by the death of\nthis Parson Chowne of ignominious canine madness. And still more, when\nI came to know by what condign parental justice this visitation smote\nhim.\n\nFor while the women were busy up-stairs by candle-light, and with some\nweeping, it fell to Parson Rambone\'s lot to lay the truth before us.\nThis great man took at once to Captain Rodney Bluett, as if he had known\nhim for years; nor did he fail to remember me, and in his distress to\nseek some comfort from my simple wisdom. So having packed all the\ncountry boobies, constables, doctors, and so on, out of the house, we\nbarred the door, made a bright fire in the kitchen, and sat down in\nfront of it, while a nice cook began to toss up some sweetbreads, and\neggs and ham-collops, and so on, for our really now highly necessary\nsustenance.\n\nYou may remember the time I met with a very nice fellow (then Chowne\'s\nhead-groom), who gave me a capital supper of tripe elegantly stewed by a\nyoung cook-maid, himself lamenting the stress (laid upon him by\ncircumstances) not to make his wife of her. He told me then with a sigh\nof affection between his knife and fork, that social duties compelled\nhim instead to marry a publican\'s daughter, with fifty pounds down on\nthe nail, he believed, if it was a penny. Nevertheless he felt confident\nthat all would be ordered aright in the end. Now Providence had not\nallowed such a case of faith to pass unrewarded. He married the\npublican\'s daughter, got her money, and paid the last sad duties to her,\nout of the pocket of his father-in-law, in a Christian-minded manner.\nAnd then back he came to Nympton Rectory, and wedded that same\ncook-maid, who now was turning our ham so cleverly with the egg-slice.\nThus we could speak before them both, without the least constraint; and\nindeed he helped us much by his knowledge of the affairs of the family.\nAlso two Justices of the Peace, who had signed the warrant for poor\nChowne\'s end, upon the report of the doctors, but could find no one of\nstrength and courage to carry it out, except Parson Jack; these sate\nwith us to get their supper, before the long cold ride over the moors.\nAnd there sate Parson Jack himself, with his thick hands trembling,\nhopeless of eating a morsel, but dreading to be left alone for a moment.\n\n""What a difference it will make in all this neighbourhood, to be sure!""\nSo said one of their worships.\n\n""Ay, that it will,"" answered his brother magistrate. ""Since Tom Faggus\ndied, there has not been such a man to be found, nowhere round these\nhere parts.""\n\n""No, nor Tom Faggus himself,"" said the other: ""a noble highwayman he\nwere; but for mind, not fit to hold a candle to our lamented friend now\nlying up there in the counterpane.""\n\nParson Jack shuddered, and shook his great limbs, and feigned to have\ndone so on purpose; and then in defiance collected himself, and laid his\niron hand on the table, watching every great muscle, to see how long he\ncould keep it from trembling. Then I arose and grasped his hand--for\nnobody else understood him at all--and he let me take it with\nreluctance, wonder, and then deep gratitude. He had been saying to\nhimself--as I knew, though his lips never moved; and his face was set,\nin scorn of all our moralising--within himself he had been thinking, ""I\nam Jack Ketch; I am worse; I am Cain. I have murdered my own dear\nbrother.""\n\nAnd I, who had seen him brand his bitten arm with the red hot poker,\nlaying the glowing iron on, until the blood hissed out at it, I alone\ncould gage the strength of heart that now enabled him to answer my grasp\nwith his poor scorched arm, and to show his great tears, and check them.\n\nEnough of this, I cannot stand these melancholy subjects. A man of\nirreproachable life, with a tendency towards gaiety, never must allow\nhis feelings to play ducks and drakes with him. If the justice of the\nAlmighty fell upon Chowne--as I said it would--let Chowne die, and let\nus hope that his soul was not past praying for. It is not my place to be\nwretched, because the biggest villain I ever knew showed his wit by\ndying of a disease which gave him power to snap at the very devil, when\nin the fulness of time he should come thirsting to lay hold of him. And\nbut for my purpose of proving how purely justice does come home to us,\nwell contented would I be to say no more about him. Why had he been such\na villain through life? Because he was an impostor. Why did he die of\nrabid madness, under the clutch of his own best friend? Because he\nlashed his favourite hound to fly at the throat of his own grandfather.\n\nNot only does it confirm one\'s faith in the honesty of breeding, but it\nenables me to acquit all the Chownes of Devonshire--and a fine and\nwholesome race they are--of ever having produced such a scamp, in true\ncourse of legitimacy; also enables me not to point out, so much as to\nleave all my readers to think of, the humble yet undeniable traces of\nold Davy\'s sagacity.\n\nWhat had I said to Mrs Steelyard, when she overbore me so, upon an empty\nstomach? ""Madam,"" I said, ""your son, you mean!"" And it proved to be one\nof my famous hits, at a range beyond that of other men. When great stirs\nhappen, truth comes out; as an earthquake starts the weasels.\n\nEverybody knows what fine old age those wandering gypsies come to. The\ntwo most killing cares we have, are money, and reputation. Here behold\ngypsy wisdom! The disregard of the latter of the two does away with the\nplague of the former. They take what they want; while we clumsy fellows\ntoil for the cash as the only way to get the good estimation. Hence it\nwas that Chowne\'s grandfather came about stealing as lively as ever, at\nthe age of ninety. A wiry and leathery man he was, and had once been a\nfamous conjurer. And now in his old age he came to sleep in his\ngrandson\'s barn, and to live on his grandson\'s ducks, potatoes, and\npigeons. This was last harvest-time, just as Chowne was enjoying his bit\nof cub-hunting.\n\nTurning in from his sport one day, in a very sulky humour, with the\nhounds he was educating, the Parson caught his grandfather withdrawing\nin a quiet manner from a snug little hen-roost. Not knowing who it was\n(for his mother had never explained a thing to him, not even that she\nwas his mother), he thought it below his dignity to ride after this old\nfellow. But at his heels stalked a tall young hound, who had vexed him\nall day by surliness, and was now whipped in for punishment.\n\n""At him--\'loo boy!"" he called out; ""Hike forrard, catch him by the leg,\nboy!"" But the hound only showed his teeth and snarled; so that Chowne\nlet out his long lash at him. In a moment the dog sprang at his master\nwho was riding a low cob-horse, and bit him in the thigh and the horse\nin the shoulder, and then skulked off to his kennel. The hound was shot,\nand the horse shared his fate in less than six weeks afterwards; and as\nfor the Parson, we know too well what they were forced to do with him.\n\nIn her first horror, that stony woman, even Mrs Steelyard, when her son\ncame ravening at her, could not keep her secret. ""It is the judgment of\nGod,"" she cried; ""after all there is a God. He set the dogs at his\ngrandfather, and now he would bite his own mother!""\n\nHow she had managed to place him in the stead of the real Chowne heir, I\nnever heard, or at least no clear account of it; for she was not (as we\nknow already) one who would answer questions. Let him rest, whoever he\nwas. His end was bad enough, even for him.\n\nEnough of this fright--for it was a fright even to me, I assure you--let\nus come back to the innocent people injured so long by his villany.\n\nTo begin with Parson Jack. Never in all his life had he taken a stroke\ntowards his own salvation, until by that horrible job he earned\nrepentance, fear, and conscience. And not only this (for none of these\nwould have stood him in any service, with Chowne still at his elbow),\nbut that the face,--which had drawn him for years, like a loadstone of\nhell, to destruction,--now ever present in its terror, till his prayers\ngot rid of it, shone in the dark like the face of a scarecrow, if ever\nhe durst think of wickedness. His wife found the benefit of this change,\nand so did his growing family, and so did the people who flocked to his\nchurch, in the pleasure of being afraid of him. In the roads, he might\nbite; but in his surplice, he was bound to behave himself, or at least,\nhe must bite the churchwarden first. Yet no one would have him to\nsprinkle a child, until a whole year was over. And then he restored\nhimself, under a hint from a man beyond him in intellect; he made\neverybody allow that the poker had entirely cured him, by preaching from\nthe bottom of his chest, with a glass of water upon the cushion, a\nsermon that stirred every heart, with the text, ""Is thy servant a dog,\nthat he should do this thing?""\n\nI quit him with sorrow; because I found him a man of true feeling, and\ngood tobacco. We got on together so warmly that expense alone divided\nus. He would have had me for parish-clerk, if I could have seen my way\nto it.\n\nWhat prevails with a man like me, foremost first of everything? Why,\nlove of the blessed native land--which every good Welshman will love me\nfor. I may have done a thing, now and then, below our native dignity,\nexcept to those who can enter into all the things we look at. It is not\nour nature altogether, to go for less than our value. We know that we\nare of the oldest blood to be found in this ancient island, and we ask\nnothing more than to be treated as the superior race should be.\n\nIn the presence of such great ideas, who cares what becomes of me? I\nreally feel that my marriage to Polly, and prolongation of a fine old\nbreed, scarcely ought to be spoken of. A man who has described the\nbattle of the Nile need not dwell on matrimony.\n\nHurried speech does not become me on any other subject. Everybody has\nthe right to know, and everybody does know, how the whole of North Devon\nwas filled with joy, talk, and disputation, as to Commodore Bampfylde\nand the brightness of his acquittal. They drew him from Barnstaple in a\nchaise, with only two springs broken, men having taken the horses out,\nand done their best at collar-work. He would have gladly jumped out and\nkicked them, but for the feeling of their goodwill.\n\nNothing would have detracted from this, and the feasts that were felt to\nbe due upon it, if Squire Philip had only known how not to die at a time\nwhen nobody was seasonably called on to think of death. But when he\nlearned the shame inflicted by himself on his ancient race, through\ntrusting Chowne, and misbelieving his brother out of the self-same womb;\nand, above all, when he learned that Chowne was the bastard of a gypsy,\nhe cast himself into his brother\'s arms, fetched one long sigh, and\ndeparted to a better world with his hat on.\n\nThis was the best thing that he could do, if he had chosen the time\naright; and it saved a world of trouble. Sir Philip felt it a good bit,\nof course; and so did Sir Drake Bampfylde. Nevertheless, if a living man\nwithdraws into a shell so calmly, what can he expect more lively than\nhis undertakers?\n\nThis was good, and left room for Harry, or rather young Philip\nBampfylde, to step into the proper shoes, and have practice how to walk\nin them. Yet he was so caught with love of service, and of the Navy, and\nso mad about Nelson, that the General could not help himself; but let\nhim go to sea again.\n\nNelson is afloat just now. The Crappos and the Dons appear to have made\nup their minds against us; and the former have the insolence to threaten\na great invasion. If I only had two arms, I would leave my Polly to howl\nabout me. As it is, they have turned me into a herring! Colonel Lougher\nhas raised a regiment, and I am first drill-sergeant!\n\nOur dear Maid of Sker would also give her beautiful son, only six months\nold, Bampfylde Lougher Bluett, to go to the wars, and to fight the\nFrench; if any one could only show her the way to do without him. He\ncocks up his toes, in a manner which proves that his feet are meant for\nratlines.\n\nHow the war is raging! I run to and fro, upon hearing of Felix Farley\'s\nJournal, and am only fit to talk of it. Sir Philip comes down, with his\nbest tobacco, whenever he stops at Candleston. And a craft has been\nbuilt for me on purpose, by the old fellow at Appledore, and her name it\nis the ""Maid of Sker""--to dance across the Channel, whenever a one-armed\nman can navigate. Colonel Lougher, and even Lady Bluett, have such trust\nin me, that they cross if their dear Delushy seems to pine too much for\nher husband. And the Maid herself has brought her son, as proud as if he\ncame out of a wreck, to exhibit him to Moxy, and Roger, and Bunny, and\nStradling the clerk--in a word, to all the parish, and the\nextra-parochial district.\n\nNow I hope that nobody will ask me any more questions concerning any\none, male or female. If I cannot speak well of a person--my rule is to\nbe silent.\n\nHezekiah found his knavery altogether useless. He scraped himself home\nat last; and built a bellows-organ at Bridgend, with a 74-gun crash to\nit. His reputation is therefore up--especially since he rejoined the\nChurch--in all churches that can afford him. Yet he will not always own\nthat I was his salvation. Hepzibah prophesies nothing, except that\nPolly\'s little son, ""David Llewellyn,"" will do something wonderful, to\nkeep the ancient name up.\n\nIt may be so. And I think that he will. But his father never did it. How\nmany chances have I missed! How many times might I have advanced to\nstern respectability! Yet some folk will like me better, and I like\nmyself no less, for not having feigned to be more than I am--a poor\nfrail fellow.\n\nThe children still come down to the well, with three of our Bunny\'s\nforemost; they get between my knees, and open blue or brown eyes up at\nme. In spite of Roger Berkrolles nodding to instil more manners, some of\nthe prettiest stroke my white beard, coaxing for a story. Then they push\nforward little Davy, thinking that I spoil him so, because of his\ndecided genius giving such promise of bard-hood--already it would do you\ngood to hear him on the Jew\'s harp. Nevertheless I answer firmly, nine\ntimes out of ten at least--\n\n""Little dears,"" is all I say, ""Captain Davy is getting old. It is hard\nto tell a tale, but easy to find fault with it. You tell me that my left\narm will grow quite as long as my right one, if I only will shake it\nabout, and keep a hollow sleeve on. My pets, when I get another arm, I\nwill tell you another story.""\n\n\n                                THE END.\n\n\n\n\n                 PRINTED BY WILLIAM BLACKWOOD AND SONS.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[A] A clear and interesting account of this mighty sand-march\nmay be found in a very learned paper by the Rev.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'}","{'text': 'When does The Maid of the Sker take place?', 'tokens': array(['When', 'does', 'The', 'Maid', 'of', 'the', 'Sker', 'take',

Her father, the King, gathers his council together to help find a toy for the Princess that will surpass all others. The Prime Minister volunteers his son Martin to find the princess a special toy. Martin talks with Princess Petulant and promises to return in four weeks with an amazing toy.\nAt the beginning of Martin’s journey he encounters Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter who knows everything. Martin hopes that Bobolink will help him to find his way to The Wonderful Toymaker. However, Bobolink is annoyed about having to provide information about everything to everyone, and is initially reluctant to assist Martin. Martin’s lack of flattery towards him serves as a refreshing change, and Bobolink soon becomes quite eager to help him. Bobolink tells Martin that his next step is to reach the pine dwarfs, warning him to avoid conversation with the creatures or he will be stuck in the country of conversation forever. Martin almost makes it through the country of conversation without a single word, but he becomes distracted and engages in conversation with a fish. Martin’s error forces him to ""become conversation,"" and suddenly he is trapped with no way out. The princess continues to wait patiently but she eventually becomes very upset that Martin has not returned with her toy. The council becomes worried, and contemplates where Martin could possibly be. The Princess, alone and sobbing, is confronted by a pine dwarf who promises to bring her to the waterfall and show her the way to Martin. The Princess stuffs her ears with cotton and begins her journey.\nPrincess Petulant finally makes it to Martin without speaking a single word, and they are both able to escape. The two run as fast as they can to the toyshop. The Toymaker, so pleased to see them, wishes that they stay and play with him forever. Martin and Princess Petulant play with the best toys they have ever seen, finally satisfying the Princess’ desire for a new toy. Martin and Princess Petulant tell the Toymaker that they are unable to stay and although he is sad, he assists them in their journey home. Upon their return they tell the entire story to a Royal Historian who records it all in the very book in which this story is contained.', 'tokens': array(['The', 'tale', 'of', 'The', 'Wonderful', 'Toymaker', 'begins',

""WILL YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME, LITTLE WISDOM?""\n\n\n\n\nThe Country Called Nonamia\n\nEver so long ago, in the wonderful country of Nonamia, there lived an\nabsent-minded magician.  It is not usual, of course, for a magician to\nbe absent-minded; but then, if it were usual it would not have happened\nin Nonamia.  Nobody knew very much about this particular magician, for\nhe lived in his castle in the air, and it is not easy to visit any one\nwho lives in the air.  He did not want to be visited, however; visitors\nalways meant conversation, and he could not endure conversation.  This,\nby the way, was not surprising, for he was so absent-minded that he\nalways forgot the end of his sentence before he was half-way through\nthe beginning of it; and as for his visitors\' remarks--well, if he had\nhad any visitors, he would never have heard their remarks at all.  So,\nwhen some one did call on him, one day,--and that was when he had been\nliving in his castle in the air for seven hundred and seventy-seven\nyears and had almost forgotten who he was and why he was there,--the\nmagician was so astonished that he could not think of anything to say.\n\n""How did you get here?"" he asked at last; for even an absent-minded\nmagician cannot remain altogether silent, when he looks out of his\ncastle in the air and sees a Princess in a gold and silver frock, with\na bright little crown on her head, floating about on a soft white cloud.\n\n""Well, I just came, that\'s all,"" answered the Princess, with a\nparticularly friendly smile.  ""You see, I have never been able to find\nmy own castle in the air, so when the West Wind told me about yours I\nasked him to blow me here.  May I come in and see what it is like?""\n\n""Certainly not,"" said the magician, hastily.  ""It is not like anything;\nand even if it were, I should not let you come in.  Don\'t you know\nthat, if you were to enter another person\'s castle in the air, it would\nvanish away like a puff of smoke?""\n\n""Oh, dear!"" sighed the Princess.  ""I did so want to know what a real\ncastle in the air was like.  I wonder if yours is at all like mine!""\n\n""Tell me about yours,"" said the magician.  ""I may be able to help you\nto find it.""  Of course, he only said this in order to prevent her from\ncoming inside his own castle.  At the same time, a little conversation\nwith a friendly Princess in a gold and silver gown is not at all\nunpleasant, when one has lived in a castle in the air for seven hundred\nand seventy-seven years.\n\n""My castle in the air is much bigger than yours,"" she explained.  ""It\nhas ever so many rooms in it,--a large room to laugh in and a small\nroom to cry in--""\n\n""To cry in?"" interrupted the magician.  ""Why, no one ever thinks of\ncrying in a castle in the air!""\n\n""One never knows,"" answered the Princess, gravely.  ""Supposing I were\nto prick my finger, what should I do if there was n\'t a room to cry in?\nThen, there is a middling-sized room to be serious in; for there is\njust a chance that I might want to be serious sometimes, and it would\nbe as well to have a room, in case.""\n\n""Perhaps it would,"" observed the magician, who had never listened so\nattentively to a conversation in the whole of his long life.  ""What\nelse will you have in your castle?""\n\n""I shall have lots of nice books that end happily,"" answered the\nPrincess; ""and they shall be talking books, so that I need not read\nthem to find out what they are about.  I shall have plenty of happy\nthoughts in my castle, too, and lots of nice dreams piled up in heaps,\nand--well, there is just one thing more.""\n\n""What is that?"" asked the magician.\n\n""Well, I think I should like to have a Prince in my castle, a nice\nPrince, who would not want to be just dull and princely like all the\nprinces I have ever danced with, but a Prince who would like my castle\nexactly as I have built it and would play with me all day long.  That\nwould be something like a Prince, wouldn\'t it?""\n\n""You could not possibly have a Prince,"" said the magician.  ""If you\nallowed some one else even to look into your castle in the air, it\nwould vanish away like a puff of smoke.  I have lived in my castle for\nseven hundred and seventy-seven years, and I have never allowed any one\nto put a foot in it.""\n\n""Is it so beautiful, then, your castle in the air?"" asked the Princess,\nwonderingly.\n\n""I\'m sure I don\'t know,"" said the absent-minded magician; ""I don\'t\nthink I ever noticed.  I came to live in it, because it was the only\nplace in which I could be left alone.  That reminds me, that if you do\nnot go away at once I shall be obliged to become exceedingly angry with\nyou.""\n\n""By all means,"" said the Princess, who had the most charming manners in\nthe world; ""but I should like to have my castle first.""\n\n""I have n\'t got it here,"" said the magician, looking about him vaguely.\n""I know I saw it somewhere not long ago, but I can\'t remember what I\ndid with it.  However, if you ask the people of Nonamia, they will be\nable to tell you where it has gone.  You will find that they are very\nobliging.""\n\n""Will they not be surprised?"" asked the Princess.\n\n""Dear me, no!  The Nonamiacs are never surprised at anything,"" said the\nmagician; and he drew in his head from the window.  The Princess in the\ngold and silver frock sailed away on her cloud, and landed presently in\nthe flat, green country of Nonamia.\n\n""Have you seen my castle in the air?"" she asked, very politely, of the\nfirst Nonamiac she met.\n\n""What is it like?"" asked the Nonamiac, without showing the least\nsurprise.\n\n""It is ever so large and ever so beautiful, and it is packed full of\nhappiness, and there is a nice Prince inside,"" answered the Princess.\n\n""Ah,"" said the Nonamiac; ""then it must be the one I saw being blown\nalong by the South Wind.  But there was no Prince inside.""\n\nThe Princess thanked him and hastened away in the direction of the\nSouth Wind until she met another Nonamiac, to whom she explained as\npolitely as before what she wanted to know.\n\n""Ah,"" said the Nonamiac, ""that must be the castle I met just now as it\nwas being carried off by the North Wind.  But I saw no Prince inside.""\n\nThe Princess turned round and hurried after the North Wind as fast as\nshe could go.  As soon as she met another Nonamiac, however, she had to\nturn round once more, for he told her that her castle had just been\nstolen by the East Wind; and when she had been walking quite a long\ntime in the direction of the East Wind, she met yet another Nonamiac,\nwho told her that it was the West Wind who had taken away her castle in\nthe air.\n\n""It is too bad!"" said the little Princess, sitting down exhausted on a\nlarge stone by the side of the road.  ""Why should all the winds be\nplaying with my castle in the air?""\n\n""Castles in the air generally go to the winds,"" observed a traveller in\na dusty brown cloak, who was sitting on another large stone, not very\nfar off.  She was quite sure he had not been there the moment before,\nbut, in Nonamia, there was nothing remarkable about that.  The Princess\nwiped the tears out of her eyes with a small lace handkerchief, and\nlooked at the stranger.\n\n""Mine is a very particular castle in the air, you see,"" she said.  ""It\nis ever so large and ever so beautiful, and it is packed with happiness\nand dreams, and _perhaps_ there is a Prince in it, too.""\n\n""A Prince?"" said the stranger.  ""What sort of Prince?""\n\n""A nice Prince,"" explained the Princess, ""who can play games and tell\nstories and be amusing.  All the Princes I know can do nothing but\ndance, and they are not at all amusing.  I am afraid, though,"" she\nadded, sighing, ""that I am going to have my castle without a Prince,\nafter all.""\n\n""Would it do,"" asked the traveller in the dusty brown cloak, ""if you\nwere to have a Prince without a castle?""\n\n""Oh, no!"" answered the Princess, decidedly.  ""If you knew how beautiful\nmy castle in the air is, you would not even ask such a stupid question!""\n\nThen she again took up her small lace handkerchief, and she brushed the\ndust from her gold and silver gown, and polished up her bright little\ngold crown, and made herself as neat and dainty as a Princess should\nbe; for, in Nonamia, one never knows what may happen next, and it is\njust as well to be prepared.  And, in fact, no sooner was she quite\ntidy than the West Wind came hurrying along with her castle in the air;\nand the Princess gave a shout of joy and sprang inside it; and the West\nWind blew, and blew, and blew, until the castle that was packed full of\nhappiness, and the little Princess in the gold and silver gown, were\nboth completely out of sight.  The traveller looked after them and felt\na little forlorn; then he picked up his stick and walked on until he\ncame to the magician\'s castle.  This may seem a little surprising, as\nhe had no wings of any kind and the magician\'s castle was in the air;\nbut it must be remembered that it all happened in Nonamia.\n\n""Dear, dear!  Here \'s another of them!"" grumbled the magician, when he\nlooked out of his window and saw the stranger standing below.  After\nbeing alone for seven hundred and seventy-seven years, it was a little\nexhausting to have two visitors on the same day.  Besides, a traveller\nin a dusty brown cloak is not at all the same thing as a dainty\nPrincess in a gold and silver gown.\n\n""Good-day,"" said the stranger.  ""Are you the magician who has given a\ncastle in the air to a Princess in a gold and silver frock with a\nbright little crown on her head?""\n\n""Very likely; but I cannot say for certain,"" said the absent-minded\nmagician.  ""I believe there was something of the kind, now you come to\nmention it; but I could n\'t tell you what it was.  However, I don\'t\nmean to give away any more castles in the air, so the sooner you leave\nme alone, the better.""\n\n""I don\'t want a castle in the air,"" laughed the stranger.  ""People who\nspend their lives in building real houses never have time to build\ncastles in the air!  _I_ want to find the Princess, not the castle.""\n\n""That you will never do as long as she is happy in it,"" said the\nmagician.  ""People who live in castles in the air are never to be\nfound, unless they have grown tired of living in them.""\n\n""Oho!"" chuckled the stranger.  ""Are _you_ tired of living in yours,\nthen?""\n\nThe absent-minded magician tried to determine whether he should be\nangry or not, when the stranger said this; but, by the time he had made\nup his mind to be angry, he had forgotten what there was to be angry\nabout, and while he was thinking about it, the man in the dusty brown\ncloak walked away and left him.\n\nEvidently, it was not very long before the Princess grew tired of\nliving in her castle in the air, for the very next day, as the\ntraveller was once more resting on the large stone by the side of the\nroad, down she came, castle and all, and stopped just in front of him.\nTruly, there is no end to the wonderful things that happen in Nonamia!\n\n""Hullo!""  said  the  traveller,  smiling.  ""What is it like inside your\ncastle?""\n\n""It is not half so nice as I expected to find it,"" said the Princess,\npopping her head out of the top window.  ""You see, there is no one to\nplay with; and even if your castle is the most beautiful castle in the\nworld, it is always dull when there is no one to play with, isn\'t it?""\n\n""I don\'t know,"" answered the stranger; ""I have never had any one to\nplay with.  What else is wrong with your castle?""\n\n""Well,"" continued the Princess, ""it is all very well to have a castle\nthat is packed with happiness; but, when it is packed so tight that you\ncannot get it out without some one to help you, it is not much good, is\nit?""\n\n""I don\'t know,"" answered the stranger; ""my happiness has never been\npacked so tight as all that.  Have you anything else to complain of?""\n\n""A great many things,"" said the Princess.  ""It is all that stupid\nmagician\'s fault.  When I said, \'a small room to cry in,\' I did n\'t\nreally mean a room to _cry_ in, did I?  But every way I turn, there is\nalways the room to cry in, staring me in the face!  I am sure there is\nsomething seriously wrong with my castle in the air.""\n\n""No doubt about it,"" said the traveller; ""and it is clearly the\nmagician\'s fault.""\n\n""When you came to live in your castle in the air,"" continued the\nPrincess, plaintively, ""did you find that it was very different from\nthe one you had built?""\n\nThe traveller in the dusty brown cloak burst out laughing.\n\n""I have no time to build castles in the air,"" he said.  ""I build real\nhouses for other people to live in, people who would, perhaps, have no\nhouses at all if I did not build them.  That is more important than\nbuilding castles in the air for one\'s self.""\n\n""What are your real houses like?"" asked the Princess.\n\n""They are strong,"" answered the stranger, proudly.  ""All the four winds\njoined together could not blow them down.  No one has ever built such\nstrong houses as mine.""\n\n""Are they beautiful, too?"" asked the Princess.\n\n""I have no time to look after that,"" answered the stranger.  ""I build\nmore houses than any one else in the world; and still, there are people\nwho are waiting for houses to live in.  I must build as fast as I can,\nday after day, year after year.""\n\n""Then why are you not building houses now?"" asked the Princess.  The\ngreat builder looked sorrowful.\n\n""There is something wrong about my real houses, too,"" he confessed.\n""The people who live in them are never quite contented; and I have come\naway to think out a new plan by myself, so that the next houses I build\nshall be the most wonderful houses in the world.""\n\nThe Princess leaned her chin on her hand, and looked quite thoughtful\nfor a moment or two.\n\n""May I come and help you to build real houses, for a change?"" she said\npresently.  ""I am dreadfully tired of building castles in the air that\ndo not turn out properly--though, of course, that was principally the\nmagician\'s fault!  Still, if you were to show me the way, I might be\nable to build something real that would turn out properly; and that\nwould be ever so much more amusing.""\n\n""It is not at all amusing,"" said the traveller, shaking his head.  ""You\nwould soon grow tired of it; besides, you would have no Prince to play\nwith.""\n\n""I don\'t think I want a Prince to play with,"" said the charming\nPrincess in the gold and silver frock.  ""He might turn out to be as\ndull as my castle in the air, especially if the magician had anything\nto do with it!  I would much sooner come and help you to build real\nhouses.""\n\nThe traveller in the dusty brown cloak still shook his head.\n\n""Little ladies in gold and silver gowns can only build castles in the\nair,"" he said.\n\n""Do the people who live in your houses never build castles in the air?""\nasked the Princess.\n\n""I never thought of asking them,"" answered the great builder.  ""I have\nbeen too much occupied in building their real houses.""\n\n""Then let us go and ask them now,"" said the Princess; and she came down\nfrom her castle in the air, and stepped once more on to the dusty road,\nand held out her little white hand to the traveller.  Her castle in the\nair vanished like a puff of smoke the moment she stepped out of it.\n\n""What would be the use of that?"" asked the traveller, smiling.  He took\nthe little white hand, however, for no one could have refused that much\nto such a very charming Princess.\n\n""Why,"" said the Princess in the gold and silver frock, ""then we could\nmake their real houses just like their castles in the air; and only\nthink how packed with happiness they would be!""\n\nThe traveller looked at her in amazement.  It was certainly astonishing\nthat so great a builder as he should find out what was wrong with his\nhouses, from a Princess with a bright little crown on her head who had\nnever done anything but build castles in the air.  Still, we must\nremember that it all happened in Nonamia; and that accounts for a great\ndeal.\n\n""You are quite right,"" said the traveller; ""you know far more about it\nthan I do.  You shall come and help me to build real houses, and they\nshall be the most wonderful houses that have ever been built.""\n\n""All beautiful to look at, and packed with happiness inside!"" cried the\ndainty little Princess, clapping her hands for joy.  ""And we won\'t let\nthat stupid magician spoil our real houses, will we?""\n\nThe magician was looking out of his window at nothing at all, when they\ncame past his castle, hand in hand.\n\n""We are going to build the most wonderful houses in the world,"" cried\nthe Princess,--""ever so much more wonderful than the stupid castle in\nthe air you gave _me_!""\n\nThis was not very gracious of her, for, after all, the magician had\ngiven her exactly what she had built for herself.  However, as he had\nalready forgotten both of them and could not think of anything to say,\nand as they were in too great a hurry to stay and help him, there is\nnothing more to be said about the magician, except that he is still\nliving in his castle in the air and looking out of his window at\nnothing at all, which is a right and proper occupation for a magician\nwho is absent-minded.  As for the traveller and the charming Princess,\nthey spent the rest of their days in building the most wonderful houses\nin the world for the people who had nowhere to live.  And as for the\npeople who had nowhere to live, it was only natural that they should\nall find their way to the country called Nonamia, where a little lady\nin a gold and silver gown taught them to build a castle in the air, and\na great builder in a dusty brown cloak made it into a real house that\nwas packed with happiness.\n\nIt is a little difficult to believe that this is all true; but then, it\nmust be remembered that it all happened in Nonamia, ever so long ago!\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: THE WYMPS SAY THAT QUEER BEGAN IT]\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Wymps Cried\n\nThe wymps and the fairies have never been able to agree.  Nobody quite\nknows why, though the Fairy Queen, who is the wisest person in the\nwhole world, was once heard to say that jealousy had something to do\nwith it.  The fairies say, however, that they would never dream of\nbeing jealous of people who live at the back of the sun and do not know\nmanners; while the wymps say it would be absurd to be jealous of any\none who lives at the front of the sun and cannot take a joke.  All the\nsame, the Fairy Queen is always right, so somebody must certainly be\njealous of somebody; and it is well known that if the wymps and the\nfairies are invited to the same party, it is sure to end in a quarrel.\nIt is really a wonder that the Fairy Queen has not lost patience with\nthe wymps long ago; but people say that she has more affection for her\nnaughty little subjects at the back of the sun than any one would\nimagine; and the Fairy Queen is so wonderful that it is quite possible\nto believe this.\n\nOnce, matters became so serious that there would have been a real war,\nif the Queen had not called an assembly of her subjects on the\nspot--which happened to be on the roof of a blacksmith\'s forge--and\nasked them what the fuss was all about.\n\n""Please, your Majesty,"" said one fairy, half crying, ""the wymps shut me\nup at the back of the sun for fifteen days, and they gave me nothing to\neat, your Majesty; they said that if I couldn\'t take a joke I couldn\'t\ntake anything.  And I should never _wish_ to take one of their jokes,\nplease your Majesty.""\n\n""Do not trouble about that,"" said the Fairy Queen, gravely.  ""For my\npart, I shall never expect you to take a joke from any one.  Now,\nCapricious, what have they done to you?"" she added, as another fairy\nwith a round dimpled face came forward in a great hurry.\n\n""Please, your Majesty,"" began Capricious, trying to make a very\ncheerful voice sound extremely doleful, ""I found a wymp in the nursery,\nafter the children had gone to bed; and he was quite upset because the\nWymp King had made a joke and no one could see it; and he asked me to\ngo behind the sun with him, so that I might help him to see the joke\nthat the King had made.  But when I got there, your Majesty, I said it\nwas much too dark to see anything and I was not at all surprised that\nno one could see the King\'s jokes; and the King was so angry that he\nordered me to be poked through the sun again; and here I am, please\nyour Majesty.""\n\nHer Majesty smiled approvingly.\n\n""You have made a joke worth two of the Wymp King\'s,"" she said; ""and I\nshall appoint you as a reward to go to Wympland with a message from me.\nDo not trouble to thank me,"" she added, as the round dimpled face of\nCapricious grew a little crestfallen, ""for there is no time.  The sun\nis just going to rise, and the moment it is above the horizon you must\ngo straight through it once more and tell the King that I invite him to\nbreakfast in Fairyland.  And now I must be off, for I have a smile to\npaint on the face of every child in the world before it wakes.""\n\nSo the Fairy Queen flew away to paint a million or two of the most\nbeautiful smiles in the world; and the other fairies popped down\nthrough the roof and did all the blacksmith\'s work for him and dropped\na nice dream on his pillow just to show they had been there; and\nCapricious sat on the edge of the chimney-pot, until the sun came above\nthe horizon and it was time for her to take the Queen\'s message to\nWympland.\n\nThe Wymp King knew better than to refuse the Queen\'s invitation to\nbreakfast; so he yawned three hundred and fifty-four times, rubbed his\neyes to keep them open--for it is a well-known thing that the Wymp King\nis nearly always asleep--and started off in the direction of Fairyland.\nThe Queen was as pleased to see him as if he had never been naughty at\nall; but, of course, she was far too much of a Queen to let him guess\nthat he was really there to be scolded.  So she made him sit next to\nher at breakfast, and gave him a cup of stinging-nettle tea to keep him\nawake, and allowed him to make as many jokes as he pleased.  The Wymp\nKing, in consequence, was extremely happy; and when the meal was over\nand the Queen began to look stern, he had to think very hard indeed\nbefore he remembered that he was nothing but a naughty little wymp\nafter all.\n\n""This state of things cannot go on,"" said the Fairy Queen.  ""What is\nthe use of my being a Queen if I am not to be obeyed?""\n\n""Your Majesty\'s chief use is to look like a Queen and to forgive your\ndisobedient subjects,"" said the Wymp King, who had taken so much\nstinging-nettle tea that he was almost bristling with jokes.\n\n""Ah,"" sighed the Fairy Queen, looking sideways at the Wymp King, ""it is\nnot at all easy to rule a country like mine.""\n\n""It is very fortunate for the country to be ruled by a Queen like you,""\nsaid the Wymp King, who had not been so wide awake for a thousand years.\n\n""Do you think so?  Then Wympland shall have a Queen for a change, and\nyou shall stay here instead and take a holiday,"" said her Majesty,\npromptly.  The Wymp King saw that he was outwitted, but he would not\nhave been a wymp if he had lost his temper about it; so he chuckled\ngood-humouredly, and pretended not to see that he had really been\ncheated of his kingdom and was nothing but a prisoner in Fairyland.\nHowever, the Fairy Queen gave him very little time even to keep his\ntemper, for she turned him into a tortoise and sent him to sleep under\na flower-pot in the garden; and then she called for Capricious to come\nand help her to choose a Queen for Wympland.  Capricious put her round,\ndimpled face on one side, and thought deeply for thirteen seconds and a\nhalf.\n\n""There is Molly, the shoemaker\'s daughter,"" said Capricious, when she\nhad finished thinking.  ""She is seven years old, and she is almost as\nfond of sleeping as his Wympish Majesty.  She would make an excellent\nQueen for Wympland.""\n\n""I remember Molly,"" said the Fairy Queen, thoughtfully.  ""She has ruled\nthe shoemaker and the shoemaker\'s wife and the shoemaker\'s customers\nfor seven years and a half; doubtless, she will have no difficulty in\nruling Wympland.  So let no time be lost, Capricious, and see that\nMolly wakes up from her morning sleep and finds herself on the Wymp\nKing\'s throne.  She will look after the wymps for a time, and I shall\nhave some peace.  Besides,"" added the Fairy Queen with her wise smile,\n""if the wymps can only be made to cry for once in their lives, we shall\nprobably have no more difficulty with them.""\n\nCapricious, who was just an ordinary little fairy and never thought\nabout anything much except singing and dancing, was quite unable to\nunderstand the Queen\'s last remark.\n\n""Shall I tell Molly what she is to do when she gets there, please your\nMajesty?"" she asked in rather a puzzled tone.\n\n""Do?"" said the Queen.  ""The rulers of Wympland never have to do\nanything.  If Molly will only keep her subjects amused, that is all\nthey will expect from her.""\n\nThat was how it was settled, and that was how Molly woke up from her\nmorning sleep and found herself on the Wymp King\'s throne, with four\nlittle wymps standing in a row just in front of her.  Molly stared at\nthe throne on which she was sitting, stared around at the dimly lighted\nLand of the Wymps, and stared at the four little wymps who stood and\nlaughed at her.\n\n""Who are you?"" she asked, opening her eyes as wide as she could.  ""Are\nyou live dolls, or fairies, or just other children for me to play with?""\n\nThe four wymps laughed more than ever when she said this, and began to\nsing a funny little song all together, just to explain who they were.\nThis was the song:--\n\n  ""We are Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer,\n  There \'s nothing to fright you and nothing to fear!\n  Four little wymps at the back of the sun,\n  Brimful of wympery, rubbish, and fun!\n\n  ""You \'ll find we are wympish; but then, we \'re not bores,\n  Though we own to a weakness for wiping off scores.\n  Ah!  Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer\n  Are never far off when mischief is near!\n\n  ""Of Kings we \'ve had many, but never a Queen;\n  So bewymping a monarch we \'ve surely not seen;\n  And--Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer\n  Though we are, yet we know how to welcome you here!\n\n  ""You \'ll surely bewymp all the wymps you come near\n  Besides Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer;\n  By the time you have gone and your wymping is done,\n  The world will have changed at the back of the sun.""\n\n\n""Are you really wymps?"" exclaimed Molly, when the four little fellows\nhad finished explaining who they were; for, like every properly\neducated child, Molly knew quite well that the wymps lived at the back\nof the sun, although she had never been there before.\n\n""To be sure we are,"" answered Skilful and Wilful and Captious and\nQueer.  ""And you are our new Queen.""\n\n""Am I?"" said Molly.  ""Oh, what fun!""\n\n""Of course it\'s fun,"" said Skilful.  ""Everything is fun up here.""\n\n""Except the King\'s jokes,"" said Wilful.\n\n""And the Fairy Queen\'s commands,"" said Captious.\n\n""And the interference of the fairies,"" said Queer.\n\n""How do the fairies interfere?"" asked Molly.\n\n""They come without being invited,"" said Skilful.\n\n""They don\'t play fair,"" said Wilful.\n\n""They always expect to win,"" said Captious.\n\n""They cry for nothing at all,"" said Queer.\n\n""I cry sometimes,"" observed Molly.\n\n""When?"" asked all four, in a tone of alarm.\n\n""When I \'m hungry,"" said Molly, ""or tired; or sometimes, when I tumble\ndown; or when I feel cross.""\n\n""You should never cry,"" said Skilful, in a superior tone.  ""It takes up\nso much time, and when you \'ve done crying you \'ve got exactly the same\nthing to cry about as before.  If you are hungry, don\'t cry but get\nsomething to eat.""\n\n""And if you \'re tired, don\'t cry but go to sleep.  Nothing could be\nsimpler,"" said Wilful.\n\n""And if you tumble down, don\'t cry but pick yourself up again,"" said\nCaptious.  ""If you know how to tumble down properly, it is the best fun\nin the world.  We spend most of our time up here in learning new ways\nof tumbling down.""\n\n""And if you are cross,"" added Queer; and then he stopped and looked\ndoubtfully at the other three.  ""What is she to do if she feels cross?""\nhe asked them.  They shook their heads in reply.\n\n""Nobody is ever cross in Wympland,"" they explained to Molly.  ""People\nwho know how to make jokes, really _good_ jokes, soon learn how to take\nthem as well, and then there is nothing left to be cross about.  You\ndon\'t feel cross now, do you?""\n\nMolly assured them that she did not feel in the least cross, and their\nfaces brightened again.\n\n""Perhaps, if you will tell us when you begin to feel cross we shall be\nable to do something for you,"" they said; ""but, whatever you do, you\nmust not cry in Wympland.  It is only the fairies who do that, and they\ndon\'t know any better.  As long as the sun has had a country at the\nback of it, no wymp has ever been known to cry.  Now, let us go and\nfind somebody to tease!""\n\n""I thought Queens could always do as they like,"" objected Molly, as\nthey took her two hands and made her jump down from the throne without\nfinding out whether she wished to come or not.\n\n""Oh, no,"" said Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer.  ""You make a\ngreat mistake.  The King always does as he is told in Wympland.  So\ncome along with us and see us tease somebody.""\n\n""I don\'t want to tease anybody,"" said Molly, decidedly.  ""I am going to\nbe a real Queen.  Real Queens do just as they like; it is only Kings\nwho do as they are told.  If you are not going to let me have my own\nway I might just as well have stopped at home, instead of coming all\nthis way on purpose to be your Queen!""\n\nThe four little wymps looked very perplexed.  ""May she do as she\nlikes?"" they asked one another, and shook their four little heads\ndoubtfully.\n\n""She might order us about,"" said Skilful.\n\n""Or laugh at us,"" said Wilful.\n\n""Or expect us to obey her,"" said Captious.\n\nBut Queer turned three somersaults in the air, just to show that he did\nnot care a bit if they did not agree with him; and then he bowed to\nMolly almost as gracefully as a fairy might have done at the front of\nthe sun.\n\n""She is a real Queen,"" he said; ""and real Queens must be obeyed.""\n\nAnd when Molly declared that she should probably cry if they did not\nimmediately allow her to have her own way, the other three wymps were\nobliged to follow Queer\'s example.\n\n""You are a real Queen, and you may do as you like,"" they said in a\nresigned tone; and Molly clapped her hands with delight.\n\n""Then please fetch me some plum-cake, and a large ice, and lots of\nbarley sugar; I am so hungry,"" she said.  Immediately, everything she\nasked for was lying before her on the King\'s throne, and they all sat\ndown and enjoyed such a dinner as only a wymp or a real Queen would\nknow how to appreciate.  When they had finished, Molly said she should\nlike to see the rest of Wympland, for nobody at the front of the sun\nhad ever been able to tell her anything about it; so they led her all\nover it, which did not take them longer than the rest of the afternoon,\nfor the world at the back of the sun is smaller than some people think,\nand that is a very good thing, for after all it is better to live on\nthe right side of the sun if one is not a wymp.\n\n""It is a very flat country,"" said the little Queen, as she trotted\nalong with two wymps on each side of her.\n\n""It has to be flat,"" explained Skilful.  ""If it were tilted ever so\nlittle we should roll into the sun and out at the other side, don\'t you\nsee; and no true wymp ever wants to do that.""\n\n""It is rather dark, too,"" continued the little Queen.\n\n""Of course,"" said Wilful, proudly.  ""It is always the same here.  Now,\nwhen you get to the front of the sun you never know whether it is going\nto be light or dark.  There are no surprises of that sort at the back\nof the sun.""\n\n""And where,"" asked Molly, ""is the royal palace?""\n\n""Wherever you like,"" answered Captious in an obliging tone.  ""Would you\nlike it here, or will you have it a little nearer the sun?  Of course\nit is warmer, near the sun, but you will find it much noisier because\nthe stars are so fond of chattering.""\n\n""I should like it here, please,"" said Molly, who did not want to wait\nanother minute for her palace.  Hardly were her words spoken than a\nperfectly charming little palace appeared in front of her, just large\nenough for such a very small Queen to feel happy in.  It was all made\nof rainbows and starshine and dewdrops; every thing that is bright and\nsweet-looking had helped to make her palace, and from the very middle\nof it rose a tall, silvery bell-tower, from which peals of laughter\nwere ringing merrily.\n\n""Oh, oh! how beautiful!"" exclaimed Molly.  ""But how is it that my\npalace is so bright while Wympland is so dull?""\n\n""Ah,"" said Queer, softly; ""we wished for the palace, you see, and the\nthings we wish for are never dull.""\n\n""It is a dream-palace,"" added Wilful; ""and dreams are never dull\neither.""\n\n""I hope it will not go away as my dreams do when I wake up in the\nmorning,"" said Molly.\n\n""Oh, no,"" they assured her.  ""It cannot disappear until we wish it to\ngo away again; and that we shall never do as long as it induces you to\nstay with us.""\n\n""Do you always wish for what you want?"" asked Molly.\n\n""Dear me, yes,"" said Captious.  ""What is the use of having a lot of\nthings lying about that you don\'t want?  There is only just enough room\nin Wympland for the things we do want, so we wish for them as we want\nthem, and that is much more convenient.  You should try it.""\n\n""Everything you see here,"" added Skilful, ""has been wished for, some\ntime or another.  Neither Wympland, nor the wymps, nor our bewymping\nlittle Queen would be here at all if somebody had not wished for them.""\n\n""And if we were all to wish hard at the same moment,"" said Wilful, ""not\none of us would be left standing here, nor would there be any country\nat all at the back of the sun.""\n\n""But we shall never wish that, now that we have a real Queen of our\nown,"" said Queer.\n\nThen, for the first time, Molly noticed that this strange little\ncountry at the back of the sun had no people in it; for, ever since she\nhad waked up on the King\'s throne, she had seen no one except Skilful\nand Wilful and Captious and Queer.\n\n""Where are all the other wymps?"" she cried.\n\n""Ah,"" they said, mysteriously; ""most people don\'t know it, but the\nwymps go through the sun every morning and spend the day in making fun\nfor the people on the other side.  That is how the people down in the\nworld are taught to laugh instead of to cry.  There would be no\nlaughter at all at the front of the sun if it were not for the wymps.""\n\n""How strange!"" said Molly.  ""I always thought it was wrong to make fun\nof people.""\n\n""So it is,"" said Queer; ""nobody but a bad wymp would do such a thing.\nA true wymp makes fun _for_ people, and that is a very different thing.""\n\n""A _very_ different thing,"" echoed the other three.  ""We only make fun\nof people who have never learnt how to laugh, and very difficult it is\nto make them into fun at all.  It\'s very poor fun when it is made,\ntoo,--most of it,"" they added, sighing.\n\nMolly was just going to ask them how they managed to make people into\nfun at all, when a number of sounds like pistol-shots suddenly came\nfrom the direction of the sun, and the four wymps grew wildly excited\nand seized her by the hands and began to race over the ground with her\nas fast as they could.\n\n""The wymps have come home!"" they gasped breathlessly.  ""If we make all\nthe haste we can, we shall be there in time to see them arrive.""\n\nIt seemed to Molly that to run after her subjects was a curious thing\nfor a real Queen to do.  However, she was far too much out of breath to\nsay anything, and the next moment they had reached the back of the sun;\nand there were dozens of little wymps, all tumbling through it, one on\nthe top of the other, until they made a large heap of themselves at the\nfeet of their new little Queen.\n\n""They are bidding you welcome,"" whispered Queer, as the heap remained\nmotionless at Molly\'s feet; and, except for the fact that a good many\nshouts of laughter were coming from it, no one would have thought it\nwas made of wymps at all.\n\n""Oh, please get up,"" implored their little Queen.  ""It is very nice of\nyou to be so glad to see me, but I am sure it must be very\nuncomfortable to lie about on the floor like that.""\n\nImmediately, the heap dissolved itself into wymps again; and they\ncrowded round Molly, tumbling up against her so clumsily and chattering\nand laughing so noisily, that she thought it was quite time to remind\nthem that she was a real Queen.\n\n""Do you think you could make a little less noise?"" she begged them.  ""I\ndon\'t like noise at all.  If you will only try to speak one at a time,\nI may be able to answer everybody.""\n\nThe wymps were so amazed to hear that she did not like noise that they\nbecame silent for a whole minute in order to think about it.  ""You\nsee,"" said Queer, apologetically, ""we have never had a Queen before, so\nwe are not quite sure what she does like.  Kings always like plenty of\nnoise; at least, it does not seem to wake them up, and that is the\ngreat thing.""\n\n""Yes, that is it!"" cried all the little wymps together.  ""We have never\nhad a Queen before, so we don\'t quite know how to treat her.""\n\n""Supposing,"" continued Queer, ""that you were to tell us the kind of\nthings that a real Queen would like us to do?""\n\n""Yes, yes!"" shouted all the other wymps, gleefully.  ""Tell us what a\nreal Queen would like us to do!""\n\nSo Molly clambered up on the King\'s throne, and tried to look as much\nlike a Queen as a very little girl, in a very short frock and a very\npink pinafore, knows how to look; and the wymps stood in front of her,\nclosely packed together; and she began to tell them some of the things\nthat a real Queen would like them to do.\n\n""First of all,"" said Molly, ""a real Queen does n\'t like her toes\ntrodden on, and her pinafore crumpled, and her hair pulled.  She does\nn\'t like being screamed at, either; and she never allows herself to be\nordered about by any one.  She likes to order other people about\ninstead, and she likes the other people to be very pleased when she\norders them about, and not to go slowly and look disagreeable and\ngrumble.  She likes a new frock every Sunday, and a birthday every\nmonth; and she always drinks milk for supper.  It is supper time now,""\nadded the little Queen, beginning to yawn.\n\nAll the wymps at once hurled themselves helter-skelter through the sun\nagain, in search of milk for their new Queen\'s supper.  But Queer ran\nfaster than any of them, and he took the very milk that Molly\'s own\nmother had just milked into the pail for herself; and the strangest\nthing of all was that, although the pail became empty before her eyes\nand she had to go without any supper, Molly\'s mother was quite happy\nafter that and did not worry any more about her little girl who had so\nstrangely disappeared in the morning.  That shows what the wymps can do\nwhen they forget to be wympish.  And Molly drank her milk and went to\nsleep in her dream-palace, and was the happiest little Queen on either\nside of the sun; and the wymps--well, it is impossible to describe what\nthe wymps felt like.\n\nMolly was Queen of Wympland for a great many days, and there had never\nreigned such peace at the back of the sun, nor in the whole world of\nFairyland either.  It was so remarkable that the Fairy Queen sent for\nCapricious, one day, and asked her why nobody had anything to grumble\nabout.  Any one might have thought from the Fairy Queen\'s tone that she\nwas not particularly pleased at so much contentment, but of course that\ncould not possibly be the case.\n\n""Please, your Majesty,"" said Capricious, who had been waiting anxiously\nto be asked this very question for quite a long time, ""it is because\nthe wymps are so much occupied in looking after their new Queen that\nthey have no time to play tricks on us.""\n\n""Ah,"" said her Majesty, smiling wisely, ""does she seem happy at the\nback of the sun?""\n\n""Everybody is happy at the back of the sun, please your Majesty,"" said\nCapricious.  ""They play games all day long to amuse their new Queen,\nand they never quarrel except for the right to do things for her little\nMajesty.  If she stays there much longer it will soon be impossible to\ndistinguish a wymp from a fairy!""\n\n""It is time she went home again,"" said the Fairy Queen, smiling wisely\nfor the second time.  ""How do the shoemaker and his wife get on without\nher?""\n\n""Their house is so quiet that the shoemaker has never made better\nshoes,"" answered Capricious.  ""The shoemaker\'s wife, though, can do\nnothing but sit out in the sunshine and wait, for she cannot bear the\nsilence indoors.  Even wympcraft cannot make her forget everything,\nyour Majesty.""\n\n""Molly must certainly go home again,"" said the Fairy Queen; ""and she\nmust go to-morrow morning.""\n\nCapricious sighed dismally.\n\n""Must she really go, your Majesty?"" she ventured to say; ""and will the\nwymps be free again to plague us with their tiresome wympish jokes?""\n\nThe Fairy Queen smiled wisely for the third time.\n\n""Wait until to-morrow morning,"" she said.  ""You may have as good a joke\nagainst the wymps as they have ever had against you.""\n\nThat night, Molly had a dream straight from Fairyland which reminded\nher that, although she had a whole palace of her own and quantities of\nlittle subjects to do her bidding, she was really the daughter of the\nshoemaker on the other side of the sun.  So, when Skilful and Wilful\nand Captious and Queer came to play with her in the morning, she told\nthem she could not be their Queen any longer, as it was time for her to\ngo back to the front of the sun.  The four little fellows looked more\ndismal than a wymp had ever been known to look before, and so did all\nthe wymps in Wympland as soon as they heard that their bewymping Queen\nwas going away from them.\n\n""Can we do nothing to make you stop with us?"" they asked her.  ""Have we\nbeen too rough with you, after all?  You must forgive us if we have,\nfor we are not accustomed to Queens, at the back of the sun.  If we try\nto be less noisy, will you not stay with us a little longer?""\n\n""Dear little wymps,"" cried Molly; ""you never tread on my toes now, nor\ncrumple my pinafore, nor pull my hair.  I do not want to go away from\nyou, but it is time for me to go back to the other side of the sun.\nWill you please show me how to get there, dear little wymps?""\n\nWhen they saw that she was quite determined to go, they led her very\nsadly to the back of the sun; and nobody made a single joke on the way,\nand there was not a smile to be seen in the whole of that sad little\nprocession.  There had never been so little laughter and so much\ndolefulness in the Land of the Wymps.\n\n""How am I to get through that?"" asked Molly, rubbing the tears out of\nher eyes and looking up at the back of the big round sun; ""and shall I\ntumble all the way down when I get to the other side?""\n\n""It is quite easy,"" explained Skilful.  ""You have only to shut your\neyes and jump through it, and the sunbeams will catch you on the other\nside; and you can slide down the one that shines into the shoemaker\'s\ngarden, where your mother sits watching for you.""\n\nThen Molly rubbed her eyes again, for there were still a great many\ntears in them, and the more she rubbed them away the faster they came\nagain, until she was really afraid the wymps would see that she was\ncrying; and that would never do, for she felt quite sure that a real\nQueen should never cry.  So she kissed her hand to her sad little\nsubjects and promised to come back again some day; and then she shut\nher eyes tight and jumped through the big round sun and slid down the\nsunbeam that shone into the shoemaker\'s garden.  And as she sped down\nthe shining, slippery sunbeam, she could hear Skilful and Wilful and\nCaptious and Queer in the distance, singing their funny little song\nabout her:--\n\n  ""You have surely bewymped all the wymps you came near,\n  Besides Skilful and Wilful and Captious and Queer!\n  And now that you \'ve gone and your wymping is done,\n  The world has grown sad at the back of the sun.""\n\nMolly never knew what happened when they finished singing; but the\nfairies knew, because they were hiding all round the edge of the sun at\nthe time.  And it was the most remarkable thing that had ever happened\nin Wympland.\n\nThe wymps say that Queer began it; and this is extremely likely, for\nQueer was always a little different from the other wymps.  Anyhow, they\nvery soon followed his example; and so it was that all the wymps at the\nback of the sun sat down on the ground and cried, because their\nbewymping little Queen was no longer with them.  And all the fairies\nwho were hiding popped up their heads and peered over the edge of the\nsun and stared in amazement at what was going on in Wympland.\n\nSo the Fairy Queen was right, as she always is, and the wymps were made\nto cry for once in their lives; and the fairies have as good a joke\nagainst the wymps as the wymps ever had against the fairies.  Perhaps\nthat is why the wymps play so few tricks on the fairies, now; but the\nFairy Queen only smiles when people say that, so she probably knows\nbetter.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: SUNNY WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE STOPPED CRYING AT ONCE]\n\n\n\n\nThe Story of Honey and Sunny\n\nThere was once a wonderful country in which everything was beautiful.\nAll the trees, and the flowers, and the birds, and the animals were\njust as beautiful as could be imagined; and the shops, and the houses,\nand the palaces were the same.  Of course all the little girls and boys\nwere beautiful, too; but that is the same everywhere.  Now, whether it\nwas because of the beauty of his kingdom, or whether it was merely on\naccount of his royal birth, it is impossible to say, but the King was\nso extremely nervous that his life was no pleasure to him.\n\n""I cannot bear anything noisy,"" he said.  ""Noise is so very alarming.""\nSo when the baby Princess cried, he sent her away to another King\'s\ncountry, to be brought up in a village nobody had ever heard of, so\nthat her royal father should not be disturbed.  And when he heard that\nthe Queen, his wife, had gone after her, he hardly raised his royal\neyebrows.  ""She laughed too much,"" he observed, thoughtfully.\n\nThe palace grew quieter day by day.  The ladies in waiting were\nforbidden to wear high heels because they made such a clatter on the\nmarble floors; so everybody knew for the first time how short everybody\nelse was.  Every courtier whose boots creaked was instantly banished,\nand if he had a cough into the bargain he was beheaded as well; but the\nclimate was so delightful that this very rarely happened.  In time,\neverybody at court took to speaking in a whisper, in order to spare the\nKing\'s nerves; and it even became the fashion to talk as little as\npossible.  The King was immensely pleased at this.  ""Anybody can talk,""\nhe said; ""but it is a sign of great refinement to be silent.""  After\nthat, even the ladies in waiting were sometimes silent for quite half\nan hour.  It is true that the King talked whenever he felt inclined,\nbut that, of course, was necessary.\n\nThe silence of the court soon spread over the country.  Laws were made\nto forbid the people to keep chickens, or pigs, or cows, or anything\nthat was noisy; and the children were ordered, by royal proclamation,\nnever to laugh, and never to cry, and never to quarrel, so that when\nthe King rode out from his palace not a sound should meet his ears.\nBut this was not all; for the birds were so frightened by the stillness\nof everything that they stopped singing altogether, and the leaves on\nthe trees ceased to rustle when the wind blew; and even the frogs and\nthe toads were startled at the hoarseness of their own voices and did\nnot croak any more, which was the most remarkable thing that ever\nhappened, for it takes a very great deal to persuade a frog or a toad\nthat his voice is not charming.  The only sound that broke the silence\nwas the occasional humming of bees, for the King still allowed the\npeople to keep bees if they liked.  ""Bees are not noisy,"" he said.\n""They do not grunt, or bark, or croak.  I can bear to listen to the\nhumming of bees.""  Even the bees did not hum so much as bees generally\ndo; for the sun soon found that nobody laughed when he was shining his\nvery best, so he went behind a cloud in a temper and stayed there for\nyears and years and years; and the bees could not do without sunshine,\neven if the King could.  So the country grew less beautiful and more\ngloomy every year.\n\nBut the village without a name in the other King\'s country, where the\nlittle Princess was being brought up, was a very different kind of\nplace.  It was full of happy people, who made as much noise as they\npleased, and laughed when they were glad, and cried when they were sad,\nand never bothered about anything at all.  And the chickens ran in and\nout of the cottages with the children, and the birds sang all the year\nround, and the sun had never been known to stop shining for a single\nminute.  It was the jolliest country imaginable, for nobody interfered\nwith anybody else, and the King never made any laws at all, and the\nonly punishment that existed was for grumbling.  It is true that there\nwas hardly any conversation, for everybody talked at once and nobody\nheard what anybody else said; but as it was not often worth hearing,\nthat did not matter in the least.  Everybody was happy and jolly, and\nthat was the great thing.\n\nLittle Sunny the Princess grew up without knowing that she was a\nPrincess at all; and nobody else knew that she was a Princess either;\nand even the Queen had almost forgotten that she was a King\'s wife.\nThat was nobody\'s concern though; and they lived in the tiniest cottage\nof all, and Sunny romped with every girl and boy in the place and was\nloved by them all.  They had called her Sunny because she could look\nstraight at the sun without blinking, which was more than the boldest\nof them could do; and it was such a good name for her that she was\nnever called anything else.  Besides, nobody knew her real name, and as\nit is much too long to be mentioned here, and as the Queen had\nforgotten it long ago, it really is of no consequence at all.\n\nOne fine day, Sunny sat up in the chocolate tree, listening to one of\nthe stories that Honey the gardener\'s son was so fond of telling her;\nand Honey the gardener\'s son lay on the grass below, and tried to catch\nthe chocolate drops with which she was pelting him.\n\n""Why are all your stories so much alike, Honey?"" asked Sunny the\nPrincess.  ""Why does the Prince always go out into the world to find a\nPrincess?  Why should n\'t the Princess go and find the Prince, for a\nchange?  I wish I was a Princess; I would start to-morrow.  What fun!""\n\nShe laughed her very happiest laugh and found an extra large chocolate\ndrop and threw it into his mouth.  Honey laughed as well as any one\ncould laugh with a chocolate drop in his mouth, and tried to think of\nan answer to her question.  Honey was not his real name either, but it\nwas the one they had given him because he knew the language of the\nbees, as, indeed, every true son of a gardener should.\n\n""Perhaps the stories are wrong,"" he said.  ""I only tell them to you as\nI have them from the bees.  Or perhaps none of those particular\nPrincesses ever wanted to go out into the world to find anybody.""\n\n""Or perhaps,"" added Sunny, ""they were just found before they had time\nto look for a Prince themselves.  Do you think that was it?  Anyhow, I\ndon\'t want to wait for a Prince, for Princes never come this way at\nall; so I am going out into the world to seek my own fortune, and I\nshall start this very moment!""\n\nShe jumped down from the chocolate tree as she spoke, and danced round\nHoney, clapping her hands with excitement.  Honey was not surprised,\nfor nobody was ever surprised at anything in that country, but he was\njust a little bit sad.\n\n""And I shall ask the first Prince I meet if he will come back with me,""\ncontinued Sunny; ""just as the Princes always ask the Princesses in the\nstories.  He won\'t know I am not a Princess, will he?  And you won\'t\ntell him, will you, Honey dear?""\n\n""I shall not be there,"" said Honey the gardener\'s son.  ""I don\'t think\nI want to look for a Princess; and I certainly cannot leave my garden.""\n\n""Oh,"" said Sunny, and she was almost grave for an instant.  ""But I will\ncome back some day, when I have found my Prince, and then you shall be\nmy gardener,"" she went on consolingly.  ""And you don\'t mind my going\nwithout you, do you, Honey dear?""\n\n""The Princes in the stories always went alone,"" answered Honey.\n\nSo that was how Sunny the Princess went out into the world, without\nknowing that she was a Princess.  And of course everybody in the\nvillage missed her; but the Queen, her mother, and Honey, the\ngardener\'s son, missed her most of all.  Before she went, however,\nHoney taught her a song which she was to sing if she ever found herself\nin trouble; and this was the song:--\n\n  ""Friends of Honey,\n  Come to Sunny;\n    Whizzing, whirring,\n    Stillness stirring,\n    Sunlight blurring;\n  Friends of Honey,\n  Fly to Sunny!""\n\nand this she learned by heart before she started.\n\nNow, she travelled a great many days without meeting with any\nadventures at all.  It was such a delightful country that everybody was\npleased to see her, and she never had any difficulty in getting enough\nto eat, for she had only to smile and that was all the payment that\nanybody wanted.  But one day, as she was walking through a wood, a\ngreat change suddenly came over everything.  Every sound was hushed,\nand the birds stopped singing, and the wind stopped playing with the\nleaves; there was not a rustle or a movement anywhere, and the sun had\ngone behind a cloud.  In the whole of her short life the little\nPrincess had never seen the sun go behind a cloud, and she felt\nextremely inclined to cry.  The further she went, the darker and\ngloomier it grew, and at last she could not bear it another minute; so\ndown she sat by the side of the road and wept heartily.\n\n""Hullo! you must stop that noise or else you will be banished,"" said a\nvoice, not very far on.  Sunny was so astonished that she stopped\ncrying at once and looked up to see a little old man with a white beard\nstaring at her.  He was a very sad-looking little man, and his mouth\nwas drawn down at the corners as though he had been on the point of\ncrying all his life and had never quite broken down.\n\n""Why must I stop?"" asked Sunny.  ""If you feel unhappy you _must_ cry,\nmust n\'t you?""\n\n""Dear me, no,"" said the sad little man, in a tone of deep gloom.  ""I am\nalways unhappy, but I never cry.  The whole country is unhappy, but\nnobody is allowed to cry.  If you cry, you must go away.""\n\n""What a funny country!"" cried Sunny, and she at once began to laugh at\nthe absurdity of it.\n\n""Don\'t do that,"" said the little man, in a tone of still greater alarm.\n""If you go on making any fresh noises, you will get beheaded.  Why\ncan\'t you be quiet?  You can do anything you like, as long as you do it\nquietly.""\n\n""May n\'t I laugh?"" exclaimed Sunny.  ""What is the use of feeling happy\nif you may n\'t laugh?""\n\n""It is n\'t any use,"" said the sad little man.  ""Nobody ever is happy in\nthis country.  Nobody ever has been happy since the King was bewitched\nand the sun went away in a temper, and that was sixteen years ago.\nNobody ever will be happy again, unless the spell is broken; and the\nspell cannot be broken until a Princess of the royal blood comes this\nway, without knowing that she is a Princess.""\n\n""How absurd!"" said Sunny.  ""As if a Princess could be a Princess\nwithout knowing she is a Princess!""\n\n""Why not?"" asked the sad little man, crossly.  He had lived alone in\nthe dark, silent wood for such a long time that he began to find the\nconversation tiring.\n\n""Oh, because there are bands and flags and balls and banquets and\ncheers and Princes and lots of fun, wherever there is a Princess,""\nreplied Sunny.\n\nThe sad little man looked more sad than before.\n\n""Then the spell will never be broken,"" he said, miserably; ""because all\nthat noise would be stopped at once.  If you have done talking you had\nbetter go, or else we shall both be banished; and I advise you to take\noff those wooden shoes of yours, unless you want to be clapped into\nprison.  But, first of all, tell me if you can look straight at the sun\nwithout blinking.""\n\nHe always asked that of every little girl who came his way, in case she\nshould happen to be a Princess; for he was really a very wise little\nman in spite of his sadness, and he knew that only eagles, and\nPrincesses who did not know they were Princesses, could look straight\nat the sun without blinking.  And he was so tired of feeling sad\nwithout being allowed to cry, that he longed to have the spell removed\nfrom the country, so that he need not keep back his tears any longer.\n\n""Why, of course I can, if there is a sun,"" laughed Sunny.  And to her\nastonishment the sad little man dropped straight on the ground, and put\nhis fists in his eyes, and began to cry at the very top of his voice,\njust like any child in any nursery.\n\n""Whatever is the matter?"" exclaimed Sunny.\n\n""Matter?"" shouted the little man, who was shaken with sobs from head to\nfoot.  ""I was never so happy in my life!  I have been longing to cry\nfor sixteen years.""\n\nThere had certainly not been so much noise in that wood for sixteen\nyears.  For no sooner did the old man begin to weep, than the trees\nbegan to rustle, and the birds began to sing, and the frogs began to\ncroak; and over it all came a faint glimmering of white light, as\nthough the sun were beginning to stretch himself behind the cloud.\n\n""What does it all mean?"" demanded Sunny.\n\n""Go on to the palace and see,"" sobbed the sad little man, and he\npointed out the way to her between his tears.  And Sunny set off\nrunning in her wooden shoes as fast as she could go, and there never\nwas such a clatter as she made when she reached the town and ran\nstraight through the gates and all along the streets; and on either\nside of her the people fell down in heaps, from sheer amazement at\nhearing such a noise after sixteen years of silence.  So nobody tried\nto stop her; and she ran faster and faster and faster, and the light\ngrew brighter and brighter and brighter, till at last she stood in the\ncourtyard of the King\'s palace.  There she saw beautiful ladies in\nmagnificent court dresses creeping about on their bare feet, and\nhandsome courtiers in elegant costumes walking on tiptoe in carpet\nslippers; and there was the Captain of the King\'s guard drilling the\nsoldiers in whispers, and there were the soldiers pretending to fire\nwith guns that had no gunpowder in them; and there was the head\ncoachman making faces at the stable boy because he could not shout at\nhim, and there was the stable boy standing on his head because he was\nnot allowed to whistle.  And into the middle of it all came the clatter\nof Sunny\'s wooden shoes, as she ran across the courtyard, and up the\nsteps, and into the palace; and down dropped the ladies in waiting in\ngraceful groups, and down dropped the courtiers just anyhow; and all\nthe soldiers fell down in neat little rows, and the Captain of the\nKing\'s guard sat down and looked at them; and the head coachman shouted\nas he had wanted to shout at all his stable boys for the last sixteen\nyears, and the stable boy waved his cap and cried ""Hurrah!""  And Sunny\nwent clattering along the great hall, past the page boys who were\nplaying marbles with india-rubber marbles, and past the kitchen where\nthe fires burned without crackling and the kettles never boiled over,\nand up the wide marble staircase, and along all the passages, until the\nsound of her coming even reached the King\'s ears.\n\nNow the King sat on his throne with cotton wool stuffed in his ears, in\ncase there should by accident be the least sound in the palace.  But,\nin spite of that, he heard the clatter of Sunny\'s shoes coming closer\nand closer, and he began to feel terribly nervous lest there really was\ngoing to be a noise at last.\n\n""What is that noise?  Take it away and behead it at once!"" he said to\nthe Prime Minister, in his most distinct whisper.  But the noise\noutside was now so great that the Prime Minister could not hear a word;\nand the next moment the door was flung open, and Sunny the Princess ran\ninto the room.  And the King looked so funny as he tried to make the\nPrime Minister hear his whispers, and the Prime Minister looked so\nfunny as he tried to hear the King\'s whispers, that Sunny was obliged\nto laugh; and when she had once begun she found she could not stop, so\nshe laughed and laughed and laughed; and when the poor, nervous old\nKing turned again to the Prime Minister to tell him to behead some one\nat once, he found that the Prime Minister was laughing too; and\nimmediately all the pages in the hall, and the courtiers in the\ncourtyard, and the cooks in the kitchen, and the townspeople in the\nstreets, and the children in the nurseries, were all laughing as\nheartily as they could.  And when the sun heard all this laughter, he\nfinished making up his mind immediately, and came out from behind the\ncloud and shone his very best once more.  So there was the sunshine\nagain, and there was everybody laughing, except the King.\n\nNow, when the King found that no one was paying any attention to his\nroyal whispers, he began to grow angry, and without thinking any more\nabout it he shouted at the very top of his royal voice.  And this was\nso remarkable, after sixteen years of whispering, that the laughter was\ninstantly hushed; and even Sunny the Princess became grave, because she\nwanted to see what was going to happen next.\n\n""Who are you?"" demanded the King, pointing at her with his sceptre.\n\n""I am Sunny, of course,"" she said, stepping up to the throne in quite a\nfriendly manner.  All the courtiers looked at one another and nodded.\n\n""She is Sunny, of course,"" they said, just as though there could be no\ndoubt about it whatever.\n\n""She is the little Princess your daughter,"" said a fresh voice from the\ndoorway.  And there stood the Queen, who had not been able to stay by\nherself any longer and had just come after Sunny as fast as she could.\nWhen the King saw her, he quite forgot that she used to laugh too much,\nand he came down from his throne in a terrific hurry and he kissed her\nseveral times before the whole court; and Sunny kissed them both there\nand then; and all the ladies in waiting in the room kissed all the\npages that were to be seen; and the courtiers stood in rows along the\nwall and never got kissed at all.\n\nSo that was how Sunny found out she was a Princess; and there were\nbands and flags and balls and banquets and cheers and Princes and lots\nof fun.  For that evening the King gave a magnificent ball, to\ncelebrate the return of his daughter Sunny; and all the Princes in the\nkingdom were invited to it.\n\n""Now,"" said the Queen, as she carefully put on Sunny\'s beautiful new\ncrown, ""you will be able to find your Prince, as you said you would.""\n\nBut Sunny shook her head and wondered why she felt so sad when\neverything seemed to be going so well; and when the Queen had gone\ndownstairs to look after the supper, she went to the open window and\nlooked out into the garden.  As she did so, there came a faint buzzing\nand humming close at hand, and three beautiful brown bees flew down and\nsettled on her round white arm.  And Sunny gave a cry of joy and knew\nall at once why she had been feeling so lonely; and she began to sing\nthe song Honey the gardener\'s son had taught her:--\n\n  ""Friends of Honey\n  Come to Sunny;\n    Whizzing, whirring,\n    Stillness stirring,\n    Sunlight blurring;\n  Friends of Honey,\n  Fly to Sunny!""\n\n\nShe had not nearly finished singing it before there came a distant\nmurmur in the still, warm air, and the murmur grew louder and louder\nuntil it would almost have deafened any one if there had been any one\nthere to deafen.  But the people in the palace were so occupied in\ndressing for the ball that a thunderstorm would not have made any\ndifference to them; and as for Sunny, the sound only reminded her of\nthe village without a name, where she had been so happy with Honey.  So\nshe leaned out of the window as far as she could, and waited until she\nsaw a dense cloud coming gradually towards her, so large that it\ncovered the whole of the setting sun.  When it reached the palace it\nhung just above it, and she could see quite plainly that it was made of\nmillions and millions of bees.  Then the three bees which had dropped\non her round white arm floated up into the air and flew round her head\nthree times and went away to join the cloud of bees overhead.  Sunny\nknew then that they were going to do what she wanted; and she clapped\nher hands and laughed, as the humming and buzzing began all over again,\nand the cloud moved away as quickly as it had come.  ""Hurry, hurry,\ndear little bees!"" she cried from the palace window; and the next\nmoment there was not a bee left in the whole kingdom, for they had all\ngone to the village without a name, in the other King\'s country.\n\nEverybody wondered why the Princess was so disdainful to all the\nPrinces who danced with her, that night.  But nobody wondered any more\nwhen Honey the gardener\'s son arrived; and this really happened, only\nthree days later.  And he came, all in his gardener\'s clothes; and he\nwalked straight into the palace, just as Sunny had done; and she met\nhim in the great hall, where the King and the Queen and the whole court\nwere having a reception to receive one another.  And they both shouted\nwith happiness and ran straight into each other\'s arms; and they kissed\nand kissed and kissed, and then they fell to talking as fast as they\ncould; and they both talked at once for three quarters of an hour,\nbefore either of them heard a word.  Then they sat down on the steps of\nthe King\'s throne, just because it happened to be there, and Sunny told\nhim everything that had happened to her.  Nobody interfered, not even\nthe Prime Minister, for Sunny had done so many curious things since her\narrival that one more or less made very little difference.\n\n""It is very dull being a Princess,"" said Sunny.  ""And I don\'t like\npalaces much, after all; they are such stuffy places!  The people who\nlive in them are rather stuffy, too.  And there is n\'t a chocolate tree\nin the whole of the garden; did you ever know such a stupid garden?\nOh, I am so glad you have come, Honey dear!""\n\n""Have you found your Prince?"" was all that Honey said.\n\n""Princes are not a bit amusing,"" said Sunny.  ""There were fifty-two\nPrinces at the ball, the other night, but I did n\'t like any of them.\nI am dreadfully tired of being a Princess.  It is ever so much nicer in\nthe village, under the chocolate tree.""\n\n""Of course it is,"" said Honey.  ""We \'ll go back, shall we?""  And\nnothing the King could say would make them see any other side to the\nquestion.  Indeed, as the Queen pointed out to him, if he had not\nallowed the people to keep so many bees it might never have happened at\nall.  So the end of it was, that the Queen stayed with the King; and\nHoney and Sunny were married that very same day and went back to live\nin the village without a name.  And there they built a very small house\nin a very big garden, and they planted it with rows of chocolate trees,\nand rows of acid-drop bushes, and lots of almond rockeries; and the\nfairies came and filled it with flowers from Fairyland that had no\nnames at all, but were the most beautiful flowers that any one has ever\nseen, for they never faded or died but just changed into something else\nwhen they were tired of being the same flower.\n\nSo no wonder that Honey and Sunny were happy for ever and ever!\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: ""COME WITH ME, POET,"" SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS]\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Princess and the Poet\n\nThere was once a Poet whom nobody wanted.  Wherever he went, he was\nalways in the way; and the reason for this was his inability to do\nanything useful.  All the people in all the countries through which he\npassed seemed to be occupied in making something,--either war, or\nnoise, or money, or confusion; but the Poet could make nothing except\nlove, and that, of course, was of no use at all.  Even the women, who\nmight otherwise have welcomed him, could not endure the ugliness of his\nfeatures; and, indeed, it would have been difficult to find a face with\nless beauty in it, for he looked as if all the cares and the annoyances\nof the world had been imprinted on his countenance and left it seared\nwith lines.  So the poor, ugly Poet went from place to place, singing\npoems to which nobody listened, and offering sympathy to people who\ncould not even understand his language.\n\nOne day he came to a city he had never visited before; and, as he\nalways did, he went straight to the part where the poorer people lived,\nfor it was all about them that he wrote the poetry to which nobody\nlistened.  But, as usual, the poor people were so full of their\ntroubles that they could not even understand him.\n\n""What is the use of telling us we are unhappy?"" they grumbled.  ""We\nknow that already, and it does not interest us a bit.  Can you not do\nsomething for us?""\n\nThe Poet only shook his head.\n\n""If I did,"" he replied, ""I should probably do it very badly.  The world\nis full of people who are always doing things; the only mistake they\nmake is in generally doing them wrong.  But I am here to persuade them\nto do the right things for a change, so that you may have your chance\nof happiness as well as they.""\n\n""Oh, we shall never be happy,"" the people said.  ""If that is all you\nhave to say, you had better leave us to our unhappiness and go up to\nthe King\'s palace.  For the little Princess has been blind from her\nbirth, and her great delight is to listen to poetry, so the palace is\nfull of poets.  But none of them ever come down here, so we do not know\nwhat they are like.""\n\nThe Poet was overjoyed at hearing that at last he was in a country\nwhere he was wanted; and he set off for the palace immediately.\n\n""Who are you, and what do you want?"" demanded the royal sentinels, when\nhe presented himself at the palace gates.\n\n""I am a Poet,"" he replied.  ""And I have come to see the Princess,\nbecause she is fond of poets.""\n\n""We have never seen a poet like you,"" said the sentinels, doubtfully.\n""All the poets in the palace have smooth, smiling faces, and fine\nclothes, and white hands.  Her Royal Highness is not accustomed to\nreceiving any one so untidy as yourself.""\n\nThe Poet looked down at his weather-beaten clothes and his toil-worn\nhands; and he stared at the reflection of his wrinkled, furrowed face\nin the moat that surrounded the palace; and he sighed in a disappointed\nmanner.\n\n""I am a Poet,"" he repeated.  ""How can a man be a poet if his face is\nsmooth and his hands are white?  No man can be a poet if he has not\ntoiled and suffered and wandered over the earth, for the sake of the\npeople who are in it.""\n\nJust then he heard a woman\'s voice speaking from the other side of the\ngates; and looking through them, he saw a beautiful, pale Princess,\nstanding there all by herself, with a look of interest on her face.\n\n""It is the little blind Princess,"" thought the Poet, and he bowed\nstraight to the ground though he knew quite well that she could not see\nhim.  The sentinels saluted, too, for they were so accustomed to\nsaluting people who never saw them at all that the blindness of the\nlittle Princess made no difference to them.\n\n""Tell me,"" said the Princess, eagerly, ""the name of the man with the\nwonderful voice, who is saying all those beautiful, true things.""\n\n""Please your Highness,"" said the sentinels, ""he _says_ he is a Poet.""\n\n""Ah,"" cried the little Princess, joyfully, ""at last you have come; I\nhave been waiting for you all my life!  At last I have found a real\nPoet, and the Queen-mother will see now that all those people in there,\nwho say the same things over and over again in their small, thin\nvoices, are not poets at all.  Come in, Poet; why do you stay so long\noutside?""\n\nSo the drawbridge was let down, and the sentinels saw what a mistake\nthey had made and did their best to pretend that they had not made it\nat all; and for the first time in his life the Poet felt that he was\nnot in anybody\'s way.\n\n""Come with me, Poet,"" said the little Princess, holding out her small\nwhite hand to him.  ""If you will take my hand, I shall feel quite sure\nyou are there.""\n\nSo the little blind Princess and the Poet went into the palace, hand in\nhand.\n\n""I have found a Poet,"" she announced to the whole court, just as it was\nsitting down to luncheon.\n\n""What!  Another?"" groaned the King from the top of the table.  ""I\nshould have thought five-and-forty were quite enough, considering the\ndemand.""\n\n""This is a _real_ Poet,"" continued the little Princess, still holding\nthe Poet\'s hand.  ""I knew him by his wonderful voice.  I am so glad he\nhas come; and now, we can send away all the others, who are not poets\nat all.""\n\nNow, this was a little awkward, for the five-and-forty poets were all\npresent; and being mostly the younger sons of kings, who had only taken\nup poetry as an accomplishment, they were also suitors for the\nPrincess\'s hand, which made it more awkward still.  So the Queen\ncoughed uncomfortably, and all the ladies in waiting blushed\nuncomfortably, and the five-and-forty poets naturally looked\nuncomfortable into the bargain.  But the little Princess, who could see\nnothing and never had been able to see anything, neither blushed nor\nfelt uncomfortable.\n\n""Will some one give place to the Poet?"" she asked with a smile.\n\nThe Queen, who was generally full of resources, felt that it was time\nto interfere.\n\n""Do not listen to Her Royal Highness,"" she said, soothingly, to the\nfive-and-forty poets.  ""She is so terribly truthful that she does not\nknow what she is saying.  I have tried in vain to break her of it.""\n\n""Don\'t know where she gets it from,"" growled the old King, who had a\ngreat dislike to scenes at meal times.\n\nThe five-and-forty poets recovered their composure, when they heard\nthat the Princess was rather to be pitied than blamed; and the Queen\nwas able to turn to the cause of the disturbance.\n\n""Will you be kind enough to go?"" she said to the Poet.  ""My daughter\ndid not know who you were because, unfortunately, she cannot see.  She\nactually mistook you for a poet!""\n\n""It is the first time,"" said the Poet, ""that any one has made the\nmistake.  However, you are quite right and I had better go.  You will\nnot like my poetry; I see five-and-forty gentlemen who can write the\npoetry that will give you pleasure; mine is written for the people, who\nhave to work that you may be happy.  Little lady,"" he added, turning to\nthe Princess, ""I pray you, think no more of me.  As for me, I shall\nlove you to the end of my days.""\n\nThen he tried to go, but the small, white fingers of the little blind\nPrincess were round his own rough, tanned ones, and he could not move.\n\n""I loved you before you came,"" she said, smiling.  ""I have been waiting\nfor you all the time.  Why are you in such a hurry to go, if you love\nme?""\n\nThe listeners grew more scandalised every moment.  No one had seen such\nlove-making before.  To be sure, the five-and-forty poets had written\nlove songs innumerable, but that was not at all the same thing.  Every\none felt that something ought to be done and nobody quite knew how to\ndo it.  Fortunately, the King was hungry.\n\n""I think you had better say the rest in private, when we have had\nlunch,"" he said grimly, and the courtiers looked immensely relieved,\nand a place was found next to the Princess for the Poet; and the Queen\nand her ladies in waiting proceeded to make conversation, and lunch\nwent on as usual.\n\n""Now,"" said the King, with a sigh, for meals were of far greater\nimportance to him than poetry, ""you shall tell us one of your poems, so\nthat we may know whether you are a poet or not.""\n\nThen the Poet stood up and told them one of his poems.  It was about\nthe people who lived on the dark side of the city, and it was very\nfierce, and bitter, and passionate; and when he had finished telling\nit, he expected to be thrust out of the palace and banished from the\ncountry, for that was what usually happened to him.  There was a great\nsilence when he sat down again, and the Poet did not know what to make\nof it.  But the small, white fingers of the little Princess had again\nstolen round his, and that was at least consoling.\n\nThe Queen was the first to break the silence.\n\n""Charming,"" she said with an effort, ""and so new.""\n\n""We have heard nothing like it before,"" said the ladies in waiting.\n""Are there really such people as that in the world?  It might be\namusing to meet them, or, at least, to study them.""\n\nThe King glanced at all the other poets and said nothing at all.  And\nthe five-and-forty kings\' sons, who, if they were not poets, were at\nleast gentlemen, rose from their seats with one accord.\n\n""Her royal Highness was quite right,"" they said.  ""We are not poets at\nall.""\n\nThen they took leave of every one present and filed out of the room and\nrode away to their respective countries, where, of course, nobody ever\nsuspected them of being poets; and they just remained Princes of the\nroyal blood and nothing else to the end of their days.\n\n""And you, little lady?"" said the Poet, anxiously.\n\n""It was wonderful,"" answered the little blind Princess.  ""But there was\nno love in it.""\n\nBy this time the Queen had ceased to be impressed and had begun to\nremember that she was a Queen.\n\n""We are quite sure you are a poet,"" she said in her most queenly\nmanner, ""because you have told us something that we did not know\nbefore.  But we think you are not a fit companion for her royal\nHighness, and it is therefore time for you to go.""\n\n""No, no!"" cried the Princess.  ""You are not to go.  You are my Poet,\nand I want you to stay here always.""\n\nMatters were becoming serious, and every one set to work to try to turn\nthe little Princess from her purpose.\n\n""He is shockingly untidy,"" whispered the ladies in waiting.\n\n""And _so_ ugly,"" murmured the Queen; ""there is nothing distinguished\nabout him at all.""\n\n""He will cost the nation something to keep,"" added the King, without\nlowering his voice at all.\n\nBut the little Princess turned a deaf ear to them all and held out her\nhand again to the Poet.\n\n""I do not believe a word they say,"" she cried.  ""You cannot be ugly,\nyou with a voice like that!  If you are ugly, then ugliness is what I\nhave wanted all my life.  Ugliness is what I love, and you are to stay\nhere with me.""\n\nIn the end, it was the Poet himself who came to the rescue.\n\n""I cannot stay with you, little lady,"" he said gently.  ""It is true\nwhat they say; I am too ugly to be tolerated, and it has been my good\nfortune that you could not see me.  I will go away and put some love\ninto my poetry, and then, perhaps, I shall find some one who will\nlisten to me.""\n\nBut the poor little Princess burst out sobbing.\n\n""If I could only see,"" she wept, ""I would prove to you that I do not\nthink you ugly.  Oh, if I could only see!  I have never wanted to see\nbefore.""\n\n""Little lady,"" whispered the Poet, bending over her, ""_I_ am glad that\nyou cannot see.""\n\nAnd then, he turned and fled out of the palace and out of the city and\naway from the country that contained the little Princess who had loved\nhim because she was blind.  And he wandered from place to place as\nbefore; but he told no one that he was a poet, for he had felt ashamed\nof his poetry ever since the little Princess had said there was no love\nin it.  But there came a day when he could keep silent no longer, so he\nwent among the people once more and told them one of his poems.  This\ntime, he had no difficulty in making them understand, for he told them\nthe story of his love for the little blind Princess.\n\n""Why,"" said the people, when he had finished, ""the maid is easily\ncured, for it is well known among our folk that a kiss on the eyelids\nwhen asleep, from a true lover, will open the eyes of any one who has\nbeen blind from birth.""\n\nNow, when the Poet heard this, he was greatly perplexed.  For to open\nthe eyes of his little Princess was to kill her love for him; and yet,\nhe could not forget how she had wept for the want of her sight, and\nhere was the power to give it back to her, and it rested with him alone\nof all men in the world.  So he determined to make her happy at any\ncost, and he turned his face towards the King\'s palace once more and\narrived there at midday, after travelling for seven days and seven\nnights without ceasing.  But, of course, that was nothing to a poet who\nwas in love.\n\n""Dear me,"" said the King irritably, when the Poet appeared before him;\n""I thought you had gone for good.  And a pretty time we \'ve been having\nof it with the Princess, in consequence!  What have you come back for?""\n\n""I have come back to open the Princess\'s eyes,"" answered the Poet,\nboldly.\n\n""It strikes me,"" grumbled the King, ""that you opened everybody\'s eyes\npretty effectually, last time you were here.  You certainly can\'t see\nthe Princess now, for she has gone to sleep in the garden.""\n\n""That is exactly what I want,"" cried the Poet, joyfully.  ""Let me but\nkiss her eyelids while she is sleeping, and by the time she awakes I\nshall have gone for ever.""\n\n""The Queen must deal with this,"" said the King, looking helpless in the\nface of such a preposterous suggestion.  Her Majesty was accordingly\nsent for, and the Poet explained his mission all over again.\n\n""It is certainly unusual,"" said the Queen, doubtfully, ""not to say out\nof order.  But still, in view of the advantage to be gained, and by\nconsidering it in the light of medical treatment--and if you promise to\ngo away directly after, just like a physician, or--or a\nsinging-master,--perhaps something might be arranged.""\n\nThe end of it was that the Poet was taken into the garden, and there\nwas the little blind Princess sound asleep in her hammock, with a maid\nof honour fanning her on each side.\n\n""Hush,"" whispered the Queen.  ""She must not awake, on _any_ account.""\n\n""No,"" echoed the poor, ugly Poet; ""she must not awake--on _my_ account.""\n\nThen he bent over her, for the second time in his life, and touched her\neyelids with his lips.  The Princess went on dreaming happily, but the\nPoet turned and fled out of the city.\n\n""At least,"" he said, ""she shall never know how ugly I am.""\n\nThat day, every Prince who was in the palace put on his best court\nsuit, in order to charm the Princess.  But the Princess refused to be\ncharmed.  She looked at them all, with large, frightened eyes, and sent\nthem away, one by one, as they came to offer her their congratulations.\n\n""Why do you congratulate me on being able to see you?"" she asked them.\n""Are you so beautiful, then?""\n\n""Oh, _no_,"" they said in a chorus.  ""Do not imagine such a thing for a\nmoment.""\n\n""Then why should I be glad because I can see you?"" persisted the\nPrincess; and they went away much perplexed.\n\n""Tell me what is beautiful,"" said the little Princess to her mother.\n""All my life I have longed to look on beauty, and now it is all so\nconfusing that I cannot tell one thing from another.  Is there anything\nbeautiful here?""\n\n""To be sure there is,"" replied the Queen.  ""This room is very beautiful\nto begin with, and the nation is still being taxed to pay for it.""\n\n""This room?"" said the Princess in astonishment.  ""How can anything be\nbeautiful that keeps out the sun and the air?  Tell me something else\nthat is beautiful.""\n\n""The dresses of the ladies in waiting are very beautiful,"" said the\nQueen.  ""And the ladies in waiting themselves might be called beautiful\nby some, though that of course is a matter of opinion.""\n\n""They all look alike to me,"" sighed the little Princess.  ""Is there\nnothing else here that is beautiful?""\n\n""Certainly,"" answered the Queen, pointing out the wealthiest and most\neligible Prince in the room.  ""That is the handsomest man you could\never want to see.""\n\n""That?"" said the Princess, disconsolately.  ""After all, one is best\nwithout eyes!  Can you not show me some ugliness for a change?  Perhaps\nit may be ugliness that I want to see so badly.""\n\n""There is nothing ugly in the palace,"" replied the Queen.  ""When you\nget used to everything you will be able to see how beautiful it all is.""\n\nBut the Princess sighed and came down from her golden throne and\nwandered out into the garden.  She walked uncertainly, for now that she\nwas no longer blind she did not know where she was going.  And there,\nunder the trees where she had been sleeping a few hours back, stood a\nman with his face buried in his hands.\n\n""Little lady,"" he stammered, ""I tried to keep away, but--""\n\nThen the little Princess gave a shout of joy and pulled away his hands\nand looked into his face for a full minute without speaking.  She put\nher small, white fingers into every one of his wrinkles, and she\ntouched every one of his ugly scars, and she drew a deep breath of\nsatisfaction.\n\n""Just fancy,"" laughed the little Princess to the Poet; ""they have been\ntrying to persuade me in there that all those Princes and people\nare--_beautiful_!""\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: THE ROCKING-HORSES RUSHED OVER THE GROUND]\n\n\n\n\nThe Wonderful Toymaker\n\nPrincess Petulant sat on the nursery floor and cried.  She was only\neight years old, but she had lived quite long enough to grow extremely\ndiscontented; and the royal household was made very uncomfortable in\nconsequence.\n\n""I want a new toy,"" sobbed the little Princess.  ""Do you expect me to\ngo on playing with the same toys for ever?  I might just as well not be\na Princess at all!""\n\nThe whole country was searched in vain for a toy that would be likely\nto please the Princess; but, as she already possessed every kind of toy\nthat has ever been heard of, nobody succeeded in finding her a new one.\nSo the little Princess went on crying bitterly, and the royal nurses\nshook their heads and sighed.  Then the King called a council in\ndespair.\n\n""It is very absurd,"" grumbled his Majesty, ""that my daughter cannot be\nkept amused.  What is the use of an expensive government and a\nwell-dressed court, if there are not enough toys for her to play with?\nCan no one invent a new toy for the Princess Petulant?""\n\nHe looked sternly at all his councillors as he spoke; but his\ncouncillors were so horrified at being expected to invent something\nstraight out of their heads that no one said anything at all until the\nPrime Minister summoned up courage to speak.\n\n""Perhaps, if we were to send for Martin,"" he suggested, ""her royal\nHighness might consent to be comforted.""\n\n""Who is Martin?"" demanded the King.\n\n""He is my son,"" said the Prime Minister, apologetically; ""and he spends\nhis days either dreaming by himself or playing with the Princess\nPetulant.  He will never be Prime Minister,"" he added sadly, ""but he\nmight think of a way to amuse the Princess.""\n\nSo the King dismissed the council with much relief and sent for Martin\nto come and play with his daughter.  Martin walked straight up to the\nroyal nursery and found the spoilt little Princess still crying on the\nfloor.  So down on the floor sat Martin too; and he looked at her very\nsolemnly out of his round, serious eyes, and he asked her why she was\ncrying.\n\n""I want a new toy,"" she pouted.  ""I am tired of all my old toys.  Don\'t\nyou think you can find me a new toy to play with, Martin?""\n\n""If I do,"" said Martin, ""will you promise not to be cross when I run\nfaster than you do?""\n\nThe Princess nodded.\n\n""And will you promise not to mind when I don\'t want to play any more?""\n\nThe Princess nodded again.\n\n""And will you promise not to call me sulky when I don\'t feel inclined\nto talk?"" continued Martin.\n\n""Yes, yes!""  cried Princess Petulant.  ""You won\'t be long before you\nfind it, will you, Martin?""\n\n""In four weeks from now,"" said the Prime Minister\'s son, ""you will have\nme with you again.""\n\n""And I shall have my new toy,"" said the Princess Petulant, sighing\ncontentedly.\n\nNow, Martin was one of the few children who can see the fairies.  He\nknew how to coax the flower fairies to speak to him, and how to find\nthe wood fairies when they hid among the ferns, and how to laugh back\nwhen the wymps made fun of him; and, above all, he knew how to find his\nway to Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter, who knows everything.  And he\nfound his way to Bobolink, on the evening of that very same day.\n\nBobolink, the Purple Enchanter, sat on his amethyst throne in the\nmiddle of a grove of deadly nightshade.  He was the ugliest enchanter\nany one has ever seen; and on each side of him sat an enormous purple\ntoad with an ugly purple smile on his face.  Even the sun\'s rays shone\npurple in the home of the Purple Enchanter; and Martin stared at him\nfor a whole minute without speaking.  For, although Martin was two\nyears older than the little Princess Petulant, he was not a very big\nboy for all that; and there was something that made him feel a little\nqueer in the purple face, and the purple hands, and the purple\nexpression of Bobolink.\n\n""Why don\'t you say something?"" growled Bobolink, in just the kind of\nvoice one would expect such a very ugly person to have.  ""What are you\nthinking about, eh?  If it\'s anything about me, you \'d better say so at\nonce!""\n\n""Well,"" said Martin, as bravely as he could, ""I was thinking that it\nmust be very odd to be so purple as you are.  Of course,"" he added\npolitely, ""I don\'t suppose you can help it exactly, because even the\nsun is purple here, and perhaps you have got sunpurpled instead of\nsunburned.""\n\n""May I ask,"" said Bobolink, rolling his purple eyes about, ""if you came\nall this way on purpose to make remarks about me?""\n\n""No, I did n\'t,"" explained Martin, hurriedly.  ""I came to ask you the\nway to the Wonderful Toymaker, who makes all the toys for Fairyland.  I\nam going to fetch a new toy for the Princess Petulant.""\n\n""And how do you think you are going to get it?"" asked Bobolink, with a\nchuckle.\n\n""That is exactly what I want you to tell me,"" said Martin, boldly.\n\nNow, Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter, was used to being visited by\npeople who wanted to get something out of him, because, as I said\nbefore, Bobolink knows everything.  But he had never come across any\none who did not begin by flattering him; and he took a fancy to Martin\nfrom the moment he told him he was sunpurpled.  So he smiled as well as\nhe could,--which was not very well, for he had never done such a thing\nbefore and his jaws were extremely stiff,--and for the moment he hardly\nlooked ugly at all.\n\n""I like you,"" he said, nodding at the small figure of the Prime\nMinister\'s son; ""and I am going to help you.  Of course, I know quite\nwell where the Wonderful Toymaker lives; but I have promised the pine\ndwarfs not to tell, because it is the only secret they possess, and it\nwould break their hearts if any one were to hear it from me instead of\nfrom them.  You see, when a person knows everything he must keep some\nof it to himself, or else there would be nothing left for anybody else\nto say, and then there would be no more conversation.  That is the\nworst of knowing everything.  But I can show you the way to the pine\ndwarfs; and if you keep perfectly quiet and speak in a whisper to them,\nthey\'ll tell you all you want to know.""\n\n""Why must I keep perfectly quiet and speak in a whisper?"" asked Martin.\n\nBobolink scowled, and became as ugly as ever again.\n\n""Now you want to know too much, and that is n\'t fair,"" he complained.\n""I \'ll tell you the way to the pine dwarfs, and you must find out the\nrest for yourself.  Go straight ahead and take the hundred and first\nturning to the right, and the fifty-second turning to the left, then\nturn round seventeen times; and if that is n\'t good enough for you I\n\'ll never help you again.  Now, off you go!""\n\nMartin saw that he was no longer wanted and set off as fast as he\ncould.  It took him a whole week to reach the hundred and first turning\non the right; and it was the most anxious week he had ever spent, for\nhe had to keep counting the turnings all the time and was dreadfully\nafraid of losing count altogether.  And the fifty-second turning on the\nleft was almost as bad, for his way took him through a large town, and\nhe dare not stay to speak to any one for fear of overlooking one of the\nlittle streets.  He left the town behind him at last; and after walking\nfor two days longer, he reached the fifty-second turning on his left,\nand it led him to the middle of a vast sandy plain.\n\n""How queer!"" thought Martin.  ""Not a single tree to be seen!  Surely\nthe pine dwarfs don\'t live in a place like this?  Perhaps old Bobolink\nhas only hoaxed me after all.""\n\nHowever, he turned round seventeen times just to see what would happen;\nand the first thing that happened was that he became remarkably giddy\nand had to sit down on the ground to recover himself.  When he did\nrecover he found he was in a beautiful thick pine wood, with the\nsunshine coming through the branches, and flickering here and there\nover the ground, and painting the great big pine trunks bright red.\nOver it all hung the most delicious silence, only broken by the soft\npassage of the wind through the pine leaves.  Martin had almost\nforgotten the warning Bobolink had given him, but, even if he had quite\nforgotten it, nothing would have induced him to speak loudly in such a\nstillness as that.\n\n""Are you there, little pine dwarfs?"" he whispered, as he looked up\nthrough the pine trees at the blue sky on the other side.  No sooner\nhad his whisper travelled up through the hushed air than all the\nbranches seemed to be filled with life and movement; and what Martin\nhad believed to be brown pine cones suddenly moved, and ran about among\nthe trees, and slid down the long red trunks.  And then he saw they\nwere dear little brown dwarfs, who surrounded him by hundreds and\nthousands, and travelled up and down his boots, and stared at him with\nlooks full of curiosity.\n\n""Who are you, little boy, and where do you come from?"" they seemed to\nbe saying; and as they spoke all together their voices sounded exactly\nlike the wind as we hear it in the pine trees.  They were so gentle and\nkind-looking that Martin was not a bit afraid and asked them at once to\ntell him the way to the Wonderful Toymaker who makes all the toys for\nFairyland.  They were delighted to tell him all they knew, for it was\ntheir one secret and they were very proud of it; and so few people ever\ncame that way that they had very few opportunities of telling it.  So\ntheir honest little brown faces were covered with good-nature and\nsmiles, as they crooned out their information.\n\n""You must walk straight through the wood,"" they said, ""until you come\nto a waterfall at the beginning of a stream; and you must follow the\nstream down, down, down, until it brings you to a valley surrounded by\nhigh hills; and in that valley is the toyshop of the Wonderful\nToymaker, who makes all the toys for Fairyland.""\n\n""That is simple enough, I \'m sure,"" said Martin.\n\n""Ah,"" said the pine dwarfs, wisely, ""but it is not so easy to get there\nas you think; for the stream leads you through the country of the\npeople who make conversation, and they try to stop every stranger who\npasses by, so that they can make him into conversation; and that is why\nso few people ever reach the Wonderful Toymaker at all.""\n\n""Make conversation!  How funny!"" said Martin; and he almost laughed\naloud at the idea.\n\n""It is more sad than funny,"" said the pine dwarfs, sighing like a large\ngust of wind that for the moment made Martin feel quite chilly; ""for it\ngives _us_ so much to do.  You see, they make conversation, and we make\nsilence; and the more conversation they make the more silence we have\nto make to keep things even.  They are always ahead of us, for all\nthat!""  They sighed again.  Martin looked puzzled.\n\n""Still, your silence is so full of sound,"" he said.  The pine dwarfs\nlaughed softly, so softly that most people would have called it only\nsmiling.\n\n""Real silence, the best kind, is always full of sound; and of course we\nonly make the very best kind,"" they explained proudly.  ""Anybody can\nmake the other kind of silence by taking the air and sifting out the\nnoise in it.  Now, _we_ take the air, and when we have sifted out the\nnoise we fill it with sound.  That\'s a very different thing.  The worst\nof it is,"" they added, sadly, ""there is so little demand for real\nsilence.  We have layers of it piled up at the top, of those pine\ntrees, and nobody ever wants it.  The other silence is so much cheaper,\nyou see, and most people don\'t know the difference.""\n\n""When I am grown up and have a house of my own,"" said Martin, ""I shall\ncome and ask you to fill it with the very best silence for me.""\n\nThe pine dwarfs shook their little brown heads incredulously.\n\n""Wait till you are grown up,"" they said; ""and then, if you will let us\nfill one room for you, we shall be quite satisfied.  Now, set off on\nyour journey; and if you want to escape being made into conversation,\nyou must not speak a single word until you reach the valley where the\nWonderful Toymaker lives.""\n\n""Trust me!"" laughed Martin.  ""It is only talking that is difficult; any\none can keep silent.""\n\n""Very well; be careful, only be careful!"" they sighed; and in another\nmoment they had all gone back to their pine trees, and nothing was to\nbe heard except the distant sounds with which they were filling the\nsilence.\n\nThen Martin walked on until he came to the rushing waterfall; and along\nby the side of the stream he trudged and thought it was the very\nnoisiest stream he had ever come across, for it clattered over the\nstones, and splashed up in the air, and seemed bent on getting through\nlife with as much fuss and excitement as it was possible to make.  As\nhe walked along by its side, he discovered that the noise it made was\ncaused by millions of little voices, chattering and gossiping,\nquarrelling and laughing, as busily as they could.\n\n""This must be the country where they make conversation,"" thought\nMartin.  ""Well, I must be pretty careful not to let them know I can\ntalk.""  At the same time, the longer he walked by that talkative little\nstream the easier it was to forget the silence in the pine wood; and he\nbegan to think that, after all, one silent room would be quite enough\nin the house he was going to have some day.  Presently, there were not\nonly voices in the stream beside him but all around him as well, in the\ntrees, and the flowers, and the grass, and the air; and they were not\nthe pretty little voices of the fairies which he knew so well, but they\nwere the harsh, shrill, unpleasant voices of unpleasant people, who\nmust have spent their lives in chattering about things that did not\nconcern them.  Then the voices came closer and closer to him, and\nbuzzed up round his head, and shrieked into his ears, asking him dozens\nand dozens of questions, until it was all he could do not to shout at\nthem to leave him alone.\n\n""Who are you?  Where do you come from?  What do you want?  Where are\nyou going?  What are you doing here?  Why don\'t you answer?  How did\nyou get here?  Whom did you meet on the way?  Did they tell you\nanything interesting?  What is your name?  How old are you?  Who is\nyour father?  What is your mother like?  Does she give parties?  Does\nshe invite many people?  Do you know the King?  Have you been to court?\nDoes the Queen dress well?  Do you like jam or cake best?  What is your\nfavourite sweet?  Don\'t you think we are very amusing?"" etc., etc., etc.\n\nThese were only a few of the questions they asked Martin, but they\nquite cured him of any wish to speak; and, instead of telling them\nanything about himself, he just put his hands over his ears and ran as\nfast as he could until he dropped down, very much out of breath, some\nway further along the stream.  As he sat there, delighted at having\nescaped from all those impertinent voices, a curious little fish with a\nbent back popped his head above the water and nodded to him.\n\n""Good morning,"" said the fish.  His tone was so friendly that Martin\nforgot all about the warning of the pine dwarfs, and entered into\nconversation with him.\n\n""This is a strange country,"" said Martin.\n\n""It\'s a very busy country,"" answered the fish.  ""None of us get left\nalone for long; and as for me, I never get any peace at all.  If I\ncould only get my tail into my mouth, things would be very different.""\n\n""You look as though you had been trying a good deal,"" observed Martin.\n""I suppose that is why your back is so bent.""\n\n""Bent?"" cried the fish, angrily.  ""Nothing of the sort!  On the\ncontrary, it has a most elegant curve.  It\'s not the shape I complain\nabout, it\'s the difference in the work.  You see, if I could only get\nmy tail into my mouth I should be a Full-stop; and Full-stops have so\nlittle to do nowadays that I should be able to retire at once.  Being a\nComma is quite another matter; it\'s work, work, work, from year\'s end\nto year\'s end.  Hullo!  What is it now?""\n\nHis last remark was addressed to another fish, who seemed to have\nsucceeded in getting his tail into his mouth, and who spoke very\nhuskily in consequence.\n\n""Come along,"" he said to the Comma-fish; ""you \'ve got to help me to\nmake a Semi-colon.""\n\n""Oh, dear, oh, dear!"" replied the other.  ""I do wish Colons were more\nused; it would at least give me a rest and use up some of you\nFull-stops for a change.""\n\nMartin was just going to sympathise with the poor little overworked\nComma-fish, when the storm of voices he had left behind suddenly\nmanaged to overtake him; and there they were once more, buzzing round\nhis head and shrieking in his ears, until he was almost deafened by the\nnoise; while dozens of invisible hands were lifting him from the ground\nand carrying him along at a terrific pace.\n\n""He has spoken, he has spoken!"" the voices were shouting triumphantly,\nas they bore him along.  ""He is ours to make conversation of!""\n\nThen they took him into a magnificent glittering palace, made of glass\nof a thousand colours; and invisible voices told him it was all his and\nhe should be king over it, if he would only make conversation for them.\nIt was the most beautiful palace a king could possibly have wished for;\nand even the Prime Minister\'s son was dazzled by it for the moment.\nThere was everything in it that a boy could want; if he pulled a golden\ncord, down fell a shower of chocolate creams; if he went to the\nstrawberry ice room, there was a wooden spade for him to dig it out\nwith, and a wheelbarrow in which to bring it away; if he wanted a\npresent, he had only to turn on the present-tap and out came whatever\nhe wished for.  So he immediately wished for a six-bladed knife, a real\npony, and a gold watch.  For all that, he was not a bit happy.  The\nincessant talking around him never ceased for a moment; the air seemed\npacked with people whom he never saw, but who asked him innumerable\nquestions which he never attempted to answer.  Besides this, all the\nfurniture talked as well.  When he opened the door it made remarks\nabout the way he did it, which were not at all polite.  If he sat on\nthe arm of a chair, it pointed out to him in a hurt tone that chairs\nwere not intended to be used in that way.  When he cut his name on the\nmahogany dining-table, it shouted abuse at him until he had to paint\nover the letters to appease it.  The windows chatted pleasantly about\nthe weather when the wind blew, instead of rattling; and the fires\ngossiped when they were lighted, instead of crackling and smoking.  He\ngave up riding his pony after it had told him the history of its\nchildhood for the fifteenth time; and when he found that his gold watch\nwas always telling stories instead of telling the time he had to get\nrid of that too.  As for his six-bladed knife, it wearied him so much\nby telling him the same thing six times over that he threw it out of\nthe window as far as he could.  All this was excessively trying to a\nboy who had never talked much in the whole of his life; and the worst\nof it was that he was prevented by magic from running away; so the four\nweeks came to an end, and he had not found a new toy for the Princess\nPetulant.\n\nMeanwhile, the little Princess had been waiting, and waiting, and\nwaiting.  In all the eight years of her life she had never waited so\npatiently for anything; and the affairs of the country went on quite\nsmoothly in consequence.  When, however, the four weeks were over and\nMartin did not return with her new toy, Princess Petulant grew tired of\nbeing good, and, once more, she lay on the nursery floor and sobbed;\nand, once more, there was consternation in the royal household.  So the\nKing called another council.\n\n""Haven\'t you got any more sons?"" he demanded crossly of the Prime\nMinister.  The Prime Minister shook his head, and owned sadly that he\nhad only one son.\n\n""Then why do you lose him?"" said the King, still more crossly.  ""Does\nno one know where the Prime Minister\'s son has gone?""\n\nThe councillors looked helplessly at one another.  One thought that\nMartin had gone to Fairyland; another said it was to Toyland; and a\nthird declared he must be with the wymps at the back of the sun.  But,\nas nobody knew how to get to any of these places, the suggestions of\nhis councillors only made the King more annoyed than before.  At last,\nhe asked the Queen\'s advice; and the Queen proposed that the little\nPrincess should attend the council and explain why she was crying.\nHowever, when they sent up to the royal nursery for the Princess\nPetulant, there was no Princess to be seen; and the royal nurses were\nrushing everywhere in great confusion, trying to find her.\n\n""It is a most extraordinary thing,"" cried the King, ""that we cannot\nkeep anybody in the place!  What is the use of children who do nothing\nbut lose themselves?  There must be wympcraft in this!""\n\nThe Queen only said ""Poor children!"" and set to work to have the\ncountry searched for the missing pair, and sat down to cry by herself\nuntil they could be found.\n\nWhat had really happened was quite simple.  While the Princess Petulant\nwas sobbing on the nursery floor, something came through the open\nwindow and dropped with a thud just in front of her.  This astonished\nher so much, that she stopped crying and looked up to see what it was.\nThere stood a little pine dwarf, holding his hands to his ears.\n\n""Dear, dear!"" crooned the pine dwarf in his soft voice.  ""What are you\nmaking such a noise for?""\n\n""I am crying because Martin has not come back,"" said the Princess,\nsorrowfully.  ""He promised to fetch me a new toy, and he has never\nbroken his promise before.  I do wish he would come back.  Even if he\ndoes n\'t bring me a new toy, I wish he would come back.""\n\n""Ah,"" said the pine dwarf, smiling, ""now I think I can help you.  But\nyou must not cry any more; it is almost as bad as the noise they are\nmaking in the country where Martin is imprisoned.""\n\n""Oh!"" cried Princess Petulant, clapping her hands; ""do you _really_\nknow where Martin is?""\n\n""Come along with me and see,"" said the pine dwarf.  The next thing the\nPrincess knew was that she was gliding through the air in the most\ndelicious manner possible; and she never stopped until she found\nherself by the side of the waterfall, that stands at the edge of the\ncountry where they make conversation.\n\n""I cannot take you any further,"" said the pine dwarf; ""because there is\nso much noise down there that it would blow me into little pieces at\nonce.  Follow the stream along until it brings you to a glass palace,\nand there you will find Martin waiting for you.  Whatever you do,\nthough, you must not speak a word to any one until you find him.  Do\nyou think you can do this?""\n\nThe Princess was thoughtful for a whole minute.\n\n""I can do it if I stop up my ears with cotton wool,"" she said.  ""I am\nquite certain I should speak if I heard any one talking to me.""\n\nThe pine dwarf smiled again; and a linnet, who had overheard their\nconversation, kindly offered the Princess a piece of cotton wool from\nthe nest he was making; and she thanked him as charmingly as a Princess\nshould, and immediately stuffed it into her two little pink ears.  Then\nshe kissed her hand to the good little pine dwarf, and ran away along\nthe stream; and she never stopped running until she reached the\nmagnificent, glittering glass palace; and there she saw Martin right in\nthe middle of it, sitting at the table with his head in his hands.\n\n""I do believe he is crying!"" thought Princess Petulant; and she very\nnearly cried too at the mere thought of it, for no one had ever seen\nthe Prime Minister\'s son cry before.  She picked up a stone instead,\nhowever, and sent it right through the glass wall of the palace,--for\nshe was in far too great a hurry to go round to the door,--and she made\na hole large enough to slip through; and into the room she bounded,\nwhere Martin sat thinking about her.\n\nThey kissed each other a great many times; and Martin pulled the cotton\nwool out of her two little pink ears, and told her all that had\nhappened, and how miserable he had been because he could not keep his\npromise to her, and how dreadfully tired he was of conversation.\n\n""Even now,"" he added, sadly, ""I don\'t suppose they will let me go with\nyou.  Just listen to their stupid voices!  I shall have to bear that\nfor the rest of my life.""\n\n""Oh, no, you won\'t!"" buzzed the voices in the air.  ""You can go away as\nsoon as you like.  It is quite hopeless to think of making you into\nconversation; you are the most unconversational prisoner we have ever\ncaptured.  If the Princess had not put cotton wool in her ears we\nshould have caught her directly; and what splendid conversation she\nwould have made!  Unfortunately, she is out of our power now, because\nshe reached you without speaking a word; so you can go off together as\nsoon as you like.""\n\nThey did not wait to be told twice, but set off at once, hand in hand,\nand walked straight on until they reached the top of the hill that\nslopes down into the valley where the Wonderful Toymaker lives.  Then\nthey ran a race down the side of the hill; and of course Martin allowed\nthe Princess to win, so she was the first, after all, to see the most\nwonderful toyshop in the world.  It was so wonderful that she actually\nremained speechless with astonishment, until Martin caught her up; and\nthen they stood side by side and stared at it.\n\nTo begin with, it was not a toyshop at all.  The whole of the valley\nwas strewn with toys: they lay on the ground in heaps, they were piled\nhigh up on the rocks, they hung from the trees and made them look like\nhuge Christmas trees, and they covered the bushes like blossoms:\nwherever the children looked, they saw toys, toys, toys.  And such\ntoys, too!  People who have never been to Fairyland can have no idea of\nthe toys that are made by the Wonderful Toymaker; even Martin, who was\na friend of the fairies, had never seen anything like them before.  As\nfor the Princess Petulant--her large blue eyes were open, and her\nlittle round mouth was open, and she could not have spoken a word to\nplease anybody.\n\nThen, suddenly, into the middle of it all stepped the Wonderful\nToymaker.  Any one who has lived for thousands and thousands of years\nmight reasonably be expected to look old, but the Wonderful Toymaker\nlooked young enough to play with his own toys; when he laughed, the\nchildren felt that they should never feel unhappy again; and when he\ncame running towards them, turning coach-wheels on the way, they felt\ncertain that he was only a very little older than themselves.  For that\nis what happens when a man has been making toys for thousands and\nthousands of years.\n\n""My dear children, how pleased I am to see you!"" he cried joyfully.\n""At last, I shall have some one to play with!  Come and look at my two\nnew tops.""\n\nHe took them by the hands and raced them across the valley to his\nworkshop, which was strewn with gold and silver tools with handles made\nof rubies; and he took up a gaily painted top and set it spinning by\nblowing gently upon it three times.  As it spun it began to hum a tune,\nand in the tune they could hear every sound that the world\ncontains,--birds singing and wind whistling, children laughing and\nchildren crying, people talking and people quarrelling, pretty sounds\nand ugly sounds, one after another, until the children were spellbound\nwith astonishment.\n\n""Oh, oh!"" cried Princess Petulant, as the top rolled over on its side.\n""I never heard anything so beautiful before.""\n\n""The top is yours, since you like it,"" said the Wonderful Toymaker,\nhanding it to her with a bow.  ""Now listen to my other new top.""\n\nThen he took up another one, made of burnished copper, and gave it a\ntwist with his fingers, and it began to spin with all its might; and as\nit spun round, the song it sang was one that could never be described,\nfor it was full of the sounds that do not exist at all, the sounds that\nare only to be heard in Fairyland when we are lucky enough to go there.\nIt made the Princess Petulant feel sleepy; but Martin gave a shout of\npleasure when it stopped spinning.\n\n""I like that one much better,"" he said.\n\n""It is the finest toy I have ever made,"" said the Wonderful Toymaker;\n""and it is yours because you know how to appreciate it.  Now, we will\nplay games!""\n\nThey had never played such games in their lives before, nor had they\never had such a delightful playfellow.  He put such feelings of joy and\nhappiness into their hearts that the little Princess wondered how she\ncould ever have felt discontented, and Martin never once wanted to stop\nand dream.  They played with toys that would not break, however badly\nthey were treated; they chased one another over the rocks and through\nthe bushes, without getting out of breath at all; and when they could\nnot think of anything else to do, they laughed and laughed and laughed\nand laughed.  Then they sat down on the grass to rest; and the\nWonderful Toymaker sat between them and smiled at them both.\n\n""Now, we will refresh ourselves by eating unwholesome sweets,"" he said,\nand he gave a long low whistle.  Immediately, they were pelted from all\nsides by the most delicious, unwholesome sweets that were ever made;\nbut, although they were ever so unwholesome, and although the children\nate quantities and quantities of them, they were not in the least bit\nthe worse for it; and when they had eaten all they could, the Wonderful\nToymaker filled their pockets for them, and laughed again.\n\n""Won\'t you stop here always?"" he asked them.\n\nThe children shook their heads.\n\n""I must go back to mother,"" said the Princess Petulant.  ""She must be\nwondering where I am, now.""\n\n""And I have got to be Prime Minister, some day,"" said Martin, with a\nsigh.\n\n""You will never be Prime Minister,"" said the Toymaker, just as his\nfather was always saying.  ""Why can\'t you both stay with me?  Only\nthink of all the games we can have, and the toys we can make, and the\nunwholesome sweets we can eat!  Won\'t you really stay and play with me?""\n\nHowever, when he saw that they were quite determined to go home, he\nmade the best of it and asked them whether they would like to go by\nsea, or by sky, or by land.  Martin wanted to go by sky, but when the\nPrincess said she would much prefer to go by land as she had come most\nof the way by sky, the Prime Minister\'s son gave in at once and said\nthat he had meant to choose the land road all the time.  So the\nToymaker fetched two beautiful rocking-horses and helped the children\nto mount them, and said he should never forget their visit for the rest\nof his life.  He could not have said more than that, for of course he\nhas been living ever since.\n\nSo they rode out of the valley and up the hill-side, and they waved\ntheir hands to the Wonderful Toymaker who stood looking disconsolately\nafter them, and they wished they could have played with him just a\nlittle longer.  They had very little time even to wish, however, for\nthe rocking-horses rushed over the ground at such a pace that they\ncould see nothing they were passing; so, after all, they would have\nbeen none the wiser if they had come by sky as Martin had wished.  Then\nthe townspeople came out of their houses and stared with amazement, as\nthey saw their King\'s daughter and their Prime Minister\'s son racing\npast them on wooden horses; but they had no time, either, to make\nremarks on the matter before the children were out of sight again, for\nthe wooden horses never stopped until they brought their riders to the\npalace gates; and then they disappeared and left Martin and the\nPrincess Petulant knocking for admission.\n\nThen there was a hullabaloo!  The Queen dried her tears and hugged them\nboth, one after another; and the King dismissed the council which had\nnot helped him in the least; and the Prime Minister was more convinced\nthan ever that his son would never be Prime Minister; and the two\nchildren span their tops before the whole court and told the story of\ntheir adventures.  And it was at once written down, word for word, by\nthe Royal Historian, and that is how it has got inside this book.\n\nThe two children never visited the Wonderful Toymaker again; and Martin\nnever became Prime Minister.  One day he became King instead; and it\nwas all because he married the Princess Petulant the moment he was\ngrown up.  They thoroughly enjoyed life for the rest of their days, and\nso did everybody else in the kingdom, down to the Prime Minister and\nthe Royal Historian; and this was all because they never lost the\nwonderful tops which had been given them by the Wonderful Toymaker.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: HE CURLED HIMSELF UP IN THE SUN AND CLOSED HIS EYES]\n\n\n\n\nThe Professor of Practical Jokes\n\nYears and years and years ago, in a country that has been long\nforgotten, there lived a king called Grumbelo.  In spite of his\nextremely ugly name, which was certainly no fault of his, he was young,\nhandsome, and talented; and this made it all the more remarkable that\nhe had never thought of seeking a wife.  He ruled his country so well\nthat not a single poor or ill-treated person was to be found in the\nwhole of it; and yet, it was the dullest country that has ever existed.\nThe reason for this was plain; the King was all very well in his way,\nand to be well-governed no doubt has its advantages, but the people\nwere unreasonable and they wanted more than this.  They wanted court\nballs, and court banquets, and royal processions through the streets,\nwith bands playing and flags flying; they wanted more play, and more\nholidays, and more fun; and all these things, as every one knows well,\nare only to be had when there is a Queen at court.  The King, however,\nwas so well satisfied with himself that it never occurred to him how\ndreadfully dull his kingdom was growing; and he was exceedingly\nsurprised when a number of the courtiers, headed by the Royal\nComptroller of Whole Holidays and the learned Professor of Practical\nJokes,--who had been positively out of work ever since his serious\nyoung Majesty came to the throne,--waited upon him one morning, with\nthe humble request that he should begin to think about finding a Queen.\n\n""What more can you want?"" asked the young King in astonishment.\n""Surely a King, or at least a King such as I am, is enough for my\nsubjects!  I am quite satisfied with myself: is it possible that the\ncountry is not equally satisfied?""\n\n""The country is more than satisfied with your excellent Majesty,""\nexplained the Comptroller of Whole Holidays.  ""The country has never\nbeen so admirably governed before.  It feels, however, that certain\nother things are almost as important, your Majesty, as wise laws and\nhonest toil; such as--such as whole holidays, for instance.""\n\n""And practical jokes,"" murmured the learned Professor at his side.\n\nHis Majesty was silent.  It seemed incredible that the country should\nwant anything more than the excellent government of King Grumbelo; but\nhe was fond of his people at heart,--in spite of the dulness to which\nhe had brought them, and so he consented in the end to give them a\nQueen.\n\n""Go and find me the most beautiful, the most silent, and the most\nfoolish Princess in the world,"" he said to them.  ""She must be the most\nbeautiful because I shall have to look at her, and the most silent\nbecause I am able to talk for both of us, and the most foolish because\nI can be wise for her as well as for myself.  If you find me a Princess\nlike this I will make her my Queen.""\n\nNot long after, the King held a reception for all the beautiful\nPrincesses who could be collected at such a very short notice.  There\nwere a hundred and fifty altogether; but although they were without\ndoubt both beautiful and foolish, they never stopped talking for an\ninstant, and not one of them would King Grumbelo have for his Queen.\nSo the Royal Comptroller of Whole Holidays and the learned Professor of\nPractical Jokes put their heads together once more, and in a few days\'\ntime they came again to the King.\n\n""We have heard at last of the Princess who would suit you,"" they said\nto him.  ""She is so beautiful that the trees stop gossiping and the\nflowers stop breathing when she passes by; and she is so silent that if\nit were not for the wonderful expression in her eyes it would be\nimpossible to hold any conversation with her at all.""\n\n""Ah,"" said King Grumbelo, nodding his royal head approvingly; ""and is\nshe very foolish as well?""\n\n""That she must be, your Majesty,"" said the Comptroller of Whole\nHolidays, looking nervously towards the Professor of Practical Jokes,\n""because, your Majesty,--well, because--""\n\n""Because she has refused to have anything to do with your Majesty,""\nboldly interrupted the Professor.\n\n""What?"" cried the King, astounded.  ""She does not _wish_ to be my\nQueen?""\n\n""Not exactly that, your Majesty,"" stammered the Comptroller of Whole\nHolidays; ""but she declares she could never marry any one who--who--""\n\n""Who has so ridiculous a name as your Majesty!"" said the Professor of\nPractical Jokes without a moment\'s hesitation.\n\nKing Grumbelo stepped down from his throne and merely smiled.\n\n""That is of no consequence,"" he observed.  ""Evidently she knows nothing\nabout me except my unfortunate name, and that I certainly did not give\nmyself.  Tell me at once where this wonderful Princess is to be found.""\n\n""That is exactly what we do not know, your Majesty,"" they confessed,\nreluctantly.  ""As soon as the Princess heard that your Majesty wished\nto make her a Queen she fled from the country, and we have not been\nable to discover where she has hidden herself!""\n\n""No matter,"" said King Grumbelo, actually omitting to scold them for\ntheir stupidity; ""it is never difficult to find the most beautiful\nPrincess in the world!  Bring me my horse at once; you can make ready\nfor the royal wedding as soon as you please.""\n\nThe country was very badly governed while the King was away; but it was\ncertainly not dull.  Every person in the kingdom was occupied in making\npreparations for the royal wedding, and it was going to be such a\nparticularly grand royal wedding that the people were kept thoroughly\namused by looking forward to it alone.  When, however, the last touch\nhad been put to the preparations, and there was positively nothing left\nfor any one to do, the people began to grumble.  It was clear that\nthere could not be a marriage if nobody was there to be married, and no\ntidings had been received of King Grumbelo since he rode away to fetch\nhis bride.  There is no doubt that the discontent of the people would\nhave ended in a revolution if the Professor of Practical Jokes had not\nhit upon a happy idea.  ""It is true that we cannot have a royal\nwedding,"" said the Professor of Practical Jokes; ""but we can pretend to\nhave one.""\n\nThe Comptroller of Whole Holidays was only too delighted to fall in\nwith the idea, and at once issued a proclamation to the effect that the\ncountry should take a whole holiday until further notice.  After that,\nthe people could not think of grumbling; they gave themselves up to\ngeneral rejoicing, and pretended, day after day, that the King was\nbeing married, until they almost forgot that there was not even a king\nin the country.\n\nMeanwhile, King Grumbelo was riding by night and by day in search of\nhis beautiful, silent Princess.  He rode for many months without\ndiscovering a trace of her; but instead of growing tired of his search\nhe only became the more anxious to find her.  One day, as he was riding\nthrough a wood, he came upon a sweet-smelling hedge, all made of\nhoneysuckle and sweet-briar, so high that he could not climb it, and so\nthick that he could not see through it.\n\n""Dear me!"" thought King Grumbelo, ""something charming must be hidden\nbehind so pretty a hedge as this!""  He rode along it with his mind full\nof curiosity until he came to two slender, pink-and-white gates, made\nentirely of apple-blossom; and through these he could see a\nfresh-looking garden with green lawns and gravel paths and bright\nflower-beds, and in the middle of it all a dainty little house made of\nnothing but rose leaves.  The King was so impatient to know who was the\nowner of such a delightful little dwelling that he knocked at once on\nthe gates for admission; and a dragon with a singularly mild and\nharmless expression appeared inside, and asked him gently what he\nwanted.  The King looked at him in surprise; for, although he was\ndecidedly small for a dragon, he was certainly much too large and too\nclumsy to live in a house made entirely of rose leaves.\n\n""Can you tell me who lives here?"" asked King Grumbelo, politely; for,\nas every one knows, it is always wise to be polite to a dragon however\nsmall he may be.\n\n""Oh, yes,"" answered the dragon, with a wave of his tail towards the\nhouse and the garden; ""I live here.""\n\n""Nonsense!"" said the King, forgetting in his surprise to be polite.\n""You could not possibly live in so small a house as that!""\n\n""If you want to know who lives inside the house you should say so,""\nanswered the dragon, in an injured tone.  ""It is n\'t likely that a\nwell-bred dragon would live inside anything.  You should be more\ncareful in the way you express yourself.""\n\n""Well, well,"" said the King, impatiently, ""perhaps you can tell me to\nwhom the house belongs?""\n\n""No, I can\'t,"" answered the dragon, with a smile; ""because it does n\'t\nbelong to anybody, you see.  It is here because it is wanted, and when\nit is n\'t wanted any longer it will cease to be here.""\n\n""What a curious house!"" exclaimed the King.\n\n""Curious?  Not at all!"" said the dragon, looking injured again.  ""It\nwould be much more curious if it were to remain here when it was n\'t\nwanted.  You should n\'t make needless remarks.""\n\nIf King Grumbelo had not been so anxious to find out who did live\ninside the house he would certainly have ridden away, there and then;\nbut the more he looked at the beautiful garden and the charming little\ndwelling of rose leaves, the more he longed for an answer to his\nquestion.  So he kept his temper with difficulty, and turned once more\nto the aggravating dragon.\n\n""Does anybody live inside the house?"" he asked.\n\n""Of course,"" answered the dragon.  ""Do they build houses in your\ncountry to be looked at?  I suppose you can\'t help it, but I have never\nbeen asked so many senseless questions before.""\n\n""Answer me one more and I will go away,"" said King Grumbelo.  ""Does a\nbeautiful Princess, the most beautiful you have ever seen, live inside\nthe house over there?""\n\n""There is no Princess in the place, be assured of that,"" answered the\ndragon, emphatically.  ""I should not be here if there were; it is a\nthankless task to keep guard over a Princess; it means nothing but\nspells and fighting and unpleasantness, and in the end the Princess\ncomplains that you have kept the right people away.  Oh, no, nothing\nwould induce me to take another place with a Princess.  We \'ve nothing\nof _that_ kind here.""\n\n""Then I \'ll bid you good-day,"" said King Grumbelo, for he did not mean\nto waste any more time.  Just as he was going to ride away, however,\nthe door of the little house opened, and out of it stepped the\nsweetest-looking little lady the world has ever contained.  She was so\nbeautiful that as she walked down the path the flowers stopped\nbreathing and the trees stopped gossiping; and she had such wonderful\neyes that to look at them was to know everything she was thinking\nabout.  She glanced once at the King as he stood outside the gates of\napple-blossom, and then she turned aside without speaking a word and\npassed out of sight among the flower-beds.  Then the King knew that his\nsearch was over; she was beautiful and silent enough to please him,\nwhether she were foolish or not; and he made up his mind on the spot\nnot to search any more for the disdainful Princess who had run away\nfrom him.\n\n""Who is she?"" he asked the dragon, eagerly.\n\n""The Lady Whimsical, to be sure,"" answered the dragon.  ""What a lot of\nquestions you ask!""\n\n""Then go and tell the Lady Whimsical that if she pleases I would like\nto speak with her,"" said King Grumbelo.\n\nThe dragon did not move.\n\n""The Lady Whimsical never speaks,"" he observed.  ""It would really be\nmuch wiser if you were to go away.""\n\n""I am not going away,"" shouted the King, growing angry.  ""Go and ask\nher at once if she will receive me, or I will put you out of the way\nfor good and all!""\n\n""Very well,"" said the dragon, sighing; ""I suppose I must.  What name?""\n\n""King Grumbelo,"" answered the King, proudly.\n\nHe fully expected that the dragon would fall flat on the ground at the\nmention of such an important name as his; but the dragon did nothing of\nthe kind.\n\n""It is not a bit of use expecting to come in here with a name like\nthat,"" he complained.  ""The Lady Whimsical cannot bear anything ugly,\nand she has a particular horror of ugly names.  I have strict orders\nnever to mention an ugly name in her presence.  You had really better\ngo away.""\n\n""I am not going away,"" shouted the King once more.  ""Go and tell the\nLady Whimsical that a great King, who has heard how charming and how\ngracious she is, would like to make himself known to her.""\n\nThe dragon consented unwillingly to take this message, and ambled\nclumsily away among the flower-beds.  When he came back, he found the\nKing pacing restlessly up and down.\n\n""Can\'t you keep still?"" growled the dragon.  ""Your ridiculous name is\nenough to make any one giddy without--""\n\n""What did the Lady Whimsical say?"" interrupted King Grumbelo,\nimpatiently.\n\n""The Lady Whimsical never says,"" answered the dragon drowsily, as he\ncurled himself up in the sun and closed his eyes; ""but she will allow\nyou to look at her for five minutes every morning, at two hours after\nsunrise.""\n\nTwo hours after sunrise on the following morning, King Grumbelo was\naccordingly admitted into the garden beyond the pink-and-white gates of\napple-blossom.  There sat the Lady Whimsical on the doorstep of her\nrose-leaf dwelling, and in front of her stood the King.\n\n""You are the most charming person I have ever seen,"" declared the King.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled.\n\n""I never thought I should find any one so charming as you are,"" said\nthe King.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled again.\n\n""Nor so silent,"" continued the King.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled for the third time.\n\n""Nor so--"" began the King, and then he paused, for he thought she might\npossibly object to being called foolish, though foolish she undoubtedly\nwas if she did not wish him to stay longer than five minutes.  As he\nhesitated, the Lady Whimsical burst out laughing and ran inside her\nlittle house of rose leaves, and banged the door in his face.\n\n""Time\'s up,"" said the dragon, and King Grumbelo went away puzzled.  He\ncame back again, however, at the same time on the following morning;\nand there sat Lady Whimsical on the doorstep of her rose-leaf dwelling,\njust as though she were expecting him.\n\n""I have thought only of you since yesterday morning,"" sighed King\nGrumbelo.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled as before.\n\n""I shall think only of you for the rest of my days,"" declared the King.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled even more than before.\n\n""Do you know why I have come all this way to find you?"" demanded the\nKing, growing bolder.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical shook her head at him, burst out laughing, and ran\ninside her rose-leaf house as she had done the day before.\n\nTwo hours after sunrise on the following morning, the Lady Whimsical\nwas once more seated on her doorstep, and King Grumbelo was once more\nstanding in front of her.\n\n""You are so beautiful that I shall never tire of looking at you,"" said\nthe King.\n\nAgain, the Lady Whimsical only smiled.\n\n""You are so silent that you will always allow me to talk enough for\nboth of us,"" continued the King.\n\nThe Lady Whimsical smiled once more.\n\n""And since you are so foolish as to send me away every morning,"" said\nthe King, ""you must surely be foolish enough to be the Queen of so wise\na King as myself.""\n\nThe Lady Whimsical had never laughed so heartily at anything as she did\nat these words of King Grumbelo; and even after she had banged the door\nin his face, he could still hear her laughter as it floated out from\nthe windows of the dainty little house of rose leaves.  Now, all this\nwas very amusing for the Lady Whimsical, who was quite happy as long as\nshe had something to make her smile; but King Grumbelo was not so well\nsatisfied.\n\nIt was not amusing to carry on a conversation entirely alone, and he\neven began to wish secretly that the Lady Whimsical would not answer\nall his questions by laughing at them.  However, the Lady Whimsical\nshowed no signs of answering them in any other way, and at last the\nKing determined that he would make her speak to him just once, and\nafter that she might be as silent as she pleased.  So, one morning,\nwhen the dragon opened the apple-blossom gates to him as usual, he\nstrode up to Lady Whimsical with a resolute air.\n\n""Lady Whimsical, I want you to come away with me and be my Queen,"" he\nsaid.\n\nShe shook her head and smiled.\n\n""Why not?"" demanded King Grumbelo.\n\nShe smiled again.\n\n""Why not?"" shouted King Grumbelo at the very top of his voice.\n\nWhen the Lady Whimsical shrugged her shoulders and merely smiled again,\nthe King lost his patience completely, which of course was an absurd\nthing to do, considering that he had come all this way on purpose to\nfind some one who knew how to be silent.\n\n""Will nothing induce you to speak just one word to me?"" he exclaimed;\nand then he ran right away from her mocking laughter, and did not even\nwait to have the rose-leaf door banged in his face.\n\nIt was a very crestfallen King Grumbelo who knocked at the gates of\napple-blossom on the following morning.  But no one was sitting on the\ndoorstep of the dainty little house of rose leaves; and King Grumbelo\'s\nheart gave a great jump.\n\n""Where is she?"" he demanded of the dragon, who had followed him along\nthe path and was looking at him with his aggravating smile.\n\nThe dragon became reproachful.\n\n""It is your fault,"" he complained.  ""I told you she never spoke; why\ndid n\'t you listen to me?  You have driven her away now by your endless\nquestions; she has gone into her house of rose leaves, and the Wise\nWoman of the Wood alone knows what will bring her out again.""\n\nKing Grumbelo looked up at the dainty little house of rose leaves, and\nthought he heard the sound of muffled laughter floating through the\nopen windows.  He turned once more to the dragon.\n\n""Where does the Wise Woman of the Wood live?"" he asked.  But the dragon\nhad curled himself up in the sun and was already half asleep.\n\n""Don\'t ask so many questions,"" he mumbled sleepily; and King Grumbelo\nstrode angrily out of the garden.  He mounted his horse and allowed it\nto take him wherever it would, for he had no idea where the Wise Woman\nof the Wood lived, and one way was as good as another.  Towards\nsundown, a blackbird hopped on to his horse\'s head and sang to him, and\nsomething in its song so reminded the King of Lady Whimsical\'s laughter\nthat he put out his hand to caress it.  No sooner did he touch it,\nhowever, than it turned into a squirrel, and scampered away from him so\nmischievously that he was again reminded of Lady Whimsical and of the\nway she, too, had run away from him.  He put spurs to his horse and\nchased the squirrel until he overtook it, when it immediately turned\ninto a field mouse and sprang into a large hole in the root of an old\nelm tree; and after it went King Grumbelo without a moment\'s\nhesitation.  He left his horse outside, and threw his crown on the\nground, and crept into the hole as humbly as though he had not been a\nKing at all.  The hole opened into a long, dark passage which grew\nsmaller and smaller as it wound deeper into the earth, so that King\nGrumbelo could scarcely drag himself along on his hands and knees.  It\ncame to an end at last, however, and he crawled into a cavern lighted\ndimly by glow-worms.  The field mouse was just ahead of him, but before\nhe could catch it he found that it was no longer there, and in its\nplace stood a tall witch woman, with a voice like a blackbird\'s, and\neyes like a squirrel\'s, and hair the colour of a field mouse.\n\n""Tell me,"" said King Grumbelo, eagerly, ""are you the Wise Woman of the\nWood?""\n\n""Of course I am,"" said the witch woman.  ""Do you think any one else\nwould have been so much trouble to catch?  And now that you have caught\nme, what can I do for you?""\n\n""I want you to remove the spell from the Lady Whimsical, so that she\nmay be able to speak to me,"" said King Grumbelo.  The witch woman\nlaughed outright.\n\n""There is no spell over the Lady Whimsical,"" she said.  ""She can talk\nas much as she pleases.""\n\n""Then why has she never spoken to me?"" asked the King in astonishment.\n\n""You wished for the most silent woman in the world,"" said the Wise\nWoman of the Wood.  ""Now that you have found her, why do you complain?""\n\nFor the first time in his life King Grumbelo felt distinctly foolish.\n\n""I made a mistake,"" he owned.  ""I don\'t want a silent Queen at all.""\n\n""Then go back and tell her so,"" said the witch woman, promptly.\n\n""Do you think that will make her come out from her house of rose\nleaves?"" asked King Grumbelo.\n\n""I should n\'t wonder,"" said the Wise Woman of the Wood; ""but go and see\nfor yourself.  There is no need to thank me, for any one who takes the\ntrouble to follow the Wise Woman of the Wood to her home is welcome to\nwhat he may find when he gets there.""\n\nIndeed, before he had time to thank her he found himself once more\noutside the tree, with his crown lying at his feet and his horse\nstanding at his side.  He was in such a hurry to get back to the Lady\nWhimsical, however, that he did not stay to pick up his crown, but rode\nbareheaded all through the night and reached the hedge of sweet-briar\nand honeysuckle precisely at two hours after sunrise.\n\n""Dear, dear,"" complained the dragon; ""do you mean to say you \'ve come\nback again?""\n\n""I have some good news for you,"" said King Grumbelo, jovially.  ""There\nis no spell over the Lady Whimsical after all!""\n\n""Of course there is n\'t,"" said the dragon, as he slowly unfastened the\ngates of apple-blossom.  ""Did n\'t I tell you she was n\'t a Princess?""\n\nKing Grumbelo did not stay to argue the point with him, but walked\nquickly up the path and stopped in front of the dainty little house all\nmade of rose leaves.\n\n""Lady Whimsical,"" he said, very gently and humbly, ""will it please you\nto smile on me once more?  I have discovered that you are the wisest\nperson in the world, and that I am by far the most foolish.""\n\nWhen the Lady Whimsical looked out of her window and saw the King\nstanding there so humbly without his crown, the tears came right into\nher wonderful eyes and stayed there.\n\n""Oh!"" she cried, ""I am so glad you have come back!  I was afraid you\nwere never coming back any more.""\n\nShe held out her two little hands, and the King kissed them.  Then she\ncame running down the stairs as fast as she could; and they sat on the\ndoorstep side by side, and talked.\n\n""I feel as though I should never stop talking again!  Do you mind?""\nasked Lady Whimsical.\n\n""I should like nothing better,"" said King Grumbelo.  ""But first of all\nI must confess to you that I have an extremely ugly name.  Do you think\nyou can bear to hear it?""\n\n""I know it already!"" laughed the Lady Whimsical.  ""Do you suppose I\nhave n\'t coaxed it out of my dragon long ago?  But I, too, have\nsomething to confess to you.  Do you think it will make you angry?""\n\n""I am quite sure I shall never be angry again,"" declared the King.\n\n""Then,"" said Lady Whimsical, looking extremely solemn, ""to begin with,\nI am not a Princess at all.""\n\n""As if I did n\'t know that!"" laughed the King.  ""The dragon told me,\never so long ago!""\n\n""He did n\'t tell you the rest, so stop laughing and listen to me,"" said\nLady Whimsical, with severity.  ""I knew all the while who you were and\nwhat you wanted, and I pretended to be under a spell just to tease you.""\n\n""I know that, too,"" said the King, triumphantly.  ""The Wise Woman of\nthe Wood told me.""\n\n""Did she tell you that I came and hid myself here on purpose, because I\nheard you were looking for a Princess and I wanted you to find me?""\nasked the Lady Whimsical, softly.\n\n""Nobody told me that,"" answered King Grumbelo; ""I guessed it for\nmyself.""\n\n""What will the Professor of Practical Jokes say, when you come home\nwithout the Princess you went out to find?"" she asked mischievously.\n\nThe King had no time to answer, for at that moment the Professor of\nPractical Jokes--whose profession always required him to arrive\nunexpectedly in places where he was not wanted--appeared at the\napple-blossom gates and answered Lady Whimsical\'s question himself.\n\n""There is nothing to say,"" he observed.  ""There never was a Princess\nfor your Majesty to find, so of course your Majesty has n\'t found her.""\n\n""There never was anybody for you to find except me,"" added Lady\nWhimsical, who was nodding at the Professor as though she had known him\nall her life.  ""The other Princess was a practical joke, don\'t you see.\nDo you mean to say my dragon did not tell you _that_, too?""\n\n""Then, who are you?"" asked King Grumbelo in bewilderment.  The Lady\nWhimsical laughed, as she had laughed every day for a month when she\nbanged the door in the King\'s face.\n\n""Can\'t you guess?"" she exclaimed.  ""Why, I am just the daughter of the\nProfessor of Practical Jokes!""\n\nAnd the King only wondered that he had not guessed it long ago.\n\nAs they went out through the apple-blossom gates, the dainty little\nhouse of rose leaves vanished away because it was no longer wanted, and\nso did the beautiful flower-garden, and the hedge of sweet-briar and\nhoneysuckle, and the sleepy good-natured dragon.  They had no trouble\nin getting home, for the Wise Woman of the Wood had a hand in the\nmatter, and the road came racing towards them as fast as an express\ntrain; all they had to do was to stand quite still and wait until King\nGrumbelo\'s country came hurrying along, which was the most convenient\nway of travelling any one could possibly invent.  When the city reached\nthem they found they were just in time to be married, for the people\nwere on the point of celebrating their wedding for the hundred and\nfirst time; so the King and Queen were married almost before they knew\nit themselves, and certainly before the people discovered that somebody\nwas really being married at last.  This, however, was not at all\nsurprising, for the real wedding was very much the same as all the\nmake-believe ones, except that it took a little longer because the King\nand Queen were not so used to being married as the people were to\nmarrying them.\n\nAfter that, every one was as happy as it was possible to be.  The\ncountry had grown so accustomed to being frivolous that it never became\nserious again; and the King never made another law, because the people\nwere so fond of Lady Whimsical that they did everything she told them,\nand therefore no laws were needed.  The result of all this happiness\nwas that nobody in the kingdom ever grew old; and the Lady Whimsical\nwho sits and laughs on her throne at this very moment is the same Lady\nWhimsical who sat and laughed on the doorstep of her rose-leaf house,\nyears and years and years ago.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: THE LADY EMMELINA IS ALWAYS KEPT IN HER PROPER PLACE NOW]\n\n\n\n\nThe Doll that came straight from Fairyland\n\nThe country was celebrating the tenth birthday of the Prince\nPerfection.  That particular country always celebrated the tenth\nbirthday of its princes and princesses, but never before had it gone so\ncompletely wild with joy.  The fireworks began punctually at sunrise,\nand so did everything else that was worth beginning; and the happy\nshouts of the people made conversation quite impossible, except in the\nroyal family, which was fully accustomed to being shouted at whenever\nthe country had a whole holiday.  The Prince had five hundred and\nfifty-four birthday presents, and his Secretaries spent all their\nsummer holidays in writing letters to acknowledge them; and every child\nin the kingdom who was of the same age as the Prince was allowed to\ncome to the palace gates and receive a royal smile and a large box of\nbarley sugar from Prince Perfection himself.  In the afternoon, the\nPrince drove through the streets over a carpet of flowers and smiled\nwithout stopping; and by his side sat the little Princess Pansy, who\nwas not smiling at all, for she had no birthday and no presents, and\ntwo years was a long time to wait before she, too, should be ten years\nold.  Still, she was so fond of the Prince Perfection that she would\nnot have let him guess for a moment that she felt envious of him,\nalthough this he was in no danger of doing, for he was so brimful of\nhappiness that he had no time to think about his sister at all.  Truly,\nit is worth while to be ten years old if one is a Prince!  In the\nevening there was a banquet of a hundred and twenty courses, which was\nthe exact number of months in the Prince\'s life; and the two children\nsat at the head of the table between their royal parents, and managed\nto keep awake until the moment arrived to cut the birthday cake.\n\nThat was when the catastrophe occurred.  At the moment nobody suspected\nthat it was going to be a catastrophe at all.  It seemed the most\nfortunate thing in the world that the Prince\'s godmother, the Fairy\nZigzag, should manage to arrive just in time to drink her godson\'s\nhealth.  Most people would think that a catastrophe was far more likely\nto have occurred if the King and Queen had forgotten to invite the\nFairy Zigzag.  That only shows how little most of us know about fairy\ngodmothers.  The truth is that the Fairy Zigzag was not like other\ngodmothers at all.  She did not like banquets and she did not like\nnoise; and she would much sooner have sent her present by post.  It\nwould never have done, however, to refuse the Queen\'s invitation, for\nthat is what no fairy godmother has ever been known to do; so she came\nat the very last minute with a very bad grace, and she meant to go away\nagain as soon as she could.\n\nBang!  What a noise she made as she came down the chimney in a cloud of\nblue smoke!  If she had not been quite so cross she would have arrived\nthrough the window in her best chariot drawn by sea-gulls; but she was\ndetermined to take as little trouble as possible over the matter, and\nno one could take less trouble over anything than to come straight down\nthe chimney.\n\n""Oh!"" said every one with a little scream; and the Prince was so\nstartled that he cut an extremely crooked slice of cake.  As soon as\nthe blue smoke cleared away, however, and he saw that it was his fairy\ngodmother, he recovered his good manners without any difficulty, and\nwalked across the room to greet her.\n\n""I am delighted to see you, dear godmother,"" said Prince Perfection\nwith his best birthday smile, which he had been saving up all day on\npurpose.  ""Would you like to have a piece of cake?""\n\nHis parents beamed with pleasure at the charming manners of Prince\nPerfection; and the little Princess rubbed the sleep out of her eyes,\nand wondered how long it would take to live through two whole years, so\nthat she might have a birthday party and a birthday cake, and a visit\nfrom her fairy godmother.  The Fairy Zigzag, however, did not seem at\nall impressed by the charming manners of her godson.\n\n""I never eat cake,"" she said, without giving so much as a look at the\ncrooked slice of cake which the Prince was handing her on a real gold\nplate.  Her godson put down the cake immediately, and took up a silver\ngoblet filled to the brim with sparkling ginger-beer.\n\n""You have come just in time, dear godmother, to drink my health,"" he\nsaid, just as politely as ever.\n\n""I never drink healths,"" said the Fairy Zigzag, frowning.  ""I have\nplenty of my own, thank you.  What\'s the matter with your health that\nyou want every one to drink it up?  You \'d better keep it: it may come\nin useful, later on.""\n\nThis was such an entirely new view of the matter that a complete\nsilence fell on every one in the room; and all the guests put down\ntheir glasses of ginger beer, and stared into them to see if the\nPrince\'s health was floating about on the top.  In the midst of the\npause, the Fairy Zigzag stalked to the table, nodded to the royal\nparents, and took the seat that had been reserved for her at the\nQueen\'s right hand.\n\n""So good of you to come,"" murmured the Queen, nervously.  ""We never\nthought you would give us so great a pleasure.""\n\n""Oh, didn\'t you?  Then, why did you invite me?"" snapped the fairy\ngodmother.  The Queen said nothing, for she did not know what to say.\nThe King did his best to put matters right.\n\n""The Prince has been looking forward to your visit all day,"" he\nhastened to say.  ""The dear boy has hardly known how to wait until this\nevening.""\n\n""Rubbish,"" said the Fairy Zigzag, laughing most unpleasantly.  ""It is\nquite time for the dear boy to be in bed.  What is that other child\ndoing, over there?""\n\nShe pointed with her wand at the little Princess Pansy, whose eyes were\nnow so full of sleep that she could hardly keep them open.  When,\nhowever, she saw the Fairy Zigzag pointing at her, she instantly became\nwide awake, and grew quite pink with pleasure at being noticed.  It was\nthe first time any one had noticed her all that day; but of course, one\nmust expect to be forgotten when it is somebody else\'s birthday.\n\n""Oh!"" cried Princess Pansy, holding out both her hands to the cross old\nFairy Zigzag.  ""Are you really a fairy godmother?  I have never seen a\nreal fairy before, and I am so glad you have come!""\n\nThe King and Queen were horrified at the familiar way in which the\nlittle Princess was speaking to such an important guest as the fairy\ngodmother.  It was true that she was only eight years old, but it was\nquite time she learnt some of the charming manners for which her\nbrother the Prince was so remarkable.  If the Fairy Zigzag had turned\nher into a toad, or a marble statue, or something chilly like that,\nthey would not have been in the least surprised.  But the Fairy Zigzag\ndid nothing of the sort.  She just took the two hands the Princess\nPansy held out to her, and looked her full in the face; and directly\nshe did that all the crossness faded out of her own, and instead of\nbeing just a disagreeable old fairy she suddenly appeared quite\ngood-natured and pleasant.  This, indeed, was no wonder; for it would\nhave been difficult to look at the little Princess without feeling\nhappier for it.  The King and Queen, however, mistook her silence for\nanger.\n\n""Pray forgive her,"" they said, tremblingly.  ""She is so young, and she\ndoesn\'t know any better.  We have tried in vain to teach her good\nmanners.  Doubtless, when she is as old as the Prince Perfection she\nwill have learnt to be as polite as he is.""\n\n""It is to be hoped not,"" said the Fairy Zigzag, turning once more to\nthe royal parents.  ""And if I know anything about it, she will never be\nas polite as the Prince Perfection.  That child is a real child, and\nnone of us will ever make her anything else.  Now, I don\'t mean to\nwaste any more time; so come here, godson, and tell me what you would\nlike for a birthday present.""\n\nThe Prince Perfection did not know what to say.  He longed to ask for a\nsteamboat that went by real steam, or a cannon that would fire real\ngunpowder, or a balloon that would take him wherever he wished to go;\nbut he felt that only an ordinary boy would have asked for such things\nas these, and Prince Perfection had always been told by his nurses that\nhe was not an ordinary boy.\n\n""Please give me whatever you like, dear godmother,"" he said, and hoped\nvery much that it would be a steamboat with real steam.\n\n""The dear boy does not like to appear greedy,"" said the Queen.\n\n""Fiddlesticks!"" said the Fairy Zigzag, and then she pointed again at\nthe little Princess Pansy.  ""If I were to give _you_ a present, do you\nthink you would know what to choose?"" she asked her, smiling.\n\n""Oh, how beautiful!"" exclaimed Princess Pansy, clapping her hands.  To\nhave a present without a birthday was more than she had ever believed\npossible.\n\n""What will you have?"" asked the Fairy, raising her wand.  The Princess\ndid not stop to think.\n\n""I will have a wax doll, please, with blue eyes and yellow hair and\npink cheeks, dressed in a white silk frock with lots of little frills,""\nshe said, rapidly.  ""And, if you _could_ manage it,"" she added,\nglancing sideways at the Prince, her brother, ""I think I should like\none that doesn\'t melt when you put it near the fire.""\n\n""I think I can manage it,"" said the Fairy Zigzag, and down came her\nwand with a sharp tap on the table.  Princess Pansy gave a cry of\ndelight.  In front of her lay the most beautiful wax doll any little\ngirl of eight years old has ever possessed.  She had blue eyes and\nyellow curls and pink cheeks; she was dressed in a white silk frock\nwith rows and rows of little frills; she had a gold crown perched on\nher head, and she wore high-heeled shoes on her dainty feet; she had a\nreal pocket with a real lace handkerchief sticking out of it; she\ncarried a fan in one hand and a scent bottle in the other; and she\nactually possessed real six-buttoned gloves, which could be drawn on\nand off her little hands.  Princess Pansy was breathless.  She had\nnever seen anything so beautiful before.\n\n""You must thank the Fairy Zigzag,"" whispered the King and Queen.  The\nlittle Princess gave a sigh and looked up; it seemed so stupid to say\n""Thank you"" for such a superb dolly as hers.  After all, she had to say\nnothing whatever, for the Fairy Zigzag was no longer there; she had\ngone away without a chariot, or a cloud of blue smoke, or even a bang!\n\n""She has given nothing to her godson,"" said the courtiers to one\nanother; and they fully expected that Prince Perfection would fly into\na passion.  However, Prince Perfection did not fly into a passion.  He\nlooked at the little Princess as she laughed with joy over her\nbeautiful new doll; he thought just once of the steamboat that would\nhave gone by real steam, and the cannon that would have fired real\ngunpowder, and the balloon that would have taken him wherever he wished\nto go; and then he remembered that he was ten years old and a Prince,\nand he flung back his head and began to whistle.\n\n""It doesn\'t matter,"" he said, indifferently.  ""I have five hundred and\nfifty-four presents upstairs, and I don\'t care for dolls.""\n\nLittle Princess Pansy had never been so contented in the whole of her\nlife.  The palace seemed a different place to her, now that it\ncontained the doll that had come from Fairyland; and she immediately\nnamed her the Lady Emmelina, which was the most important name she\ncould remember on the spur of the moment.  From that day the Princess\nand her doll were never separated.  When the Prince and Princess went\nfor a drive, the Lady Emmelina sat up stiffly between them; when the\nProfessors came to give the children their lessons, they found that\nthey had to give them also to a little lady in a white silk frock with\nrows and rows of little frills, who stared at them solemnly with her\nlarge, impassive blue eyes, and never answered a word to any of their\nquestions.  Princess Pansy no longer wished to be ten years old; she no\nlonger wished for anything: she had everything she wanted in the\nunchangeable Lady Emmelina.  For the Lady Emmelina never varied; the\nPrincess might have as many moods as she pleased, but the Lady Emmelina\nmerely smiled.  For a constant companion, it would have been difficult\nto find any one more delightful than the Lady Emmelina.  The Prince\nPerfection, however, took a very different view of the matter.  Thanks\nto the Lady Emmelina, he had no one to play with.  He had never been\nleft so much to himself in his life, and in spite of his excellent\nopinion of himself he found himself extremely dull.  He could no longer\nplay cricket, since the Princess was not there to bowl for him; it was\nno fun to play at soldiers if the Princess was not there to be on the\nlosing side; he could not pretend to be the Royal Executioner if the\nPrincess was not there to be executed.  To be sure, he had five hundred\nand fifty-four birthday presents; but what consolation could they\nafford him when he was still without a steamboat that went by real\nsteam?  The Lady Emmelina was the cause of all his misfortunes, and he\ncould not bear the Lady Emmelina.  It was the Lady Emmelina who had\ncome in the place of his real steamboat and his real cannon and his\nreal balloon; it was the Lady Emmelina who had bewitched the little\nPrincess, his sister, and robbed him of his best playfellow.  And the\nPrince Perfection, whatever his faults were, was extremely fond of the\nlittle Princess.\n\n""If you will come and play cricket with me, I will let you have the\nfirst innings,"" he said to her in despair one sunny afternoon.\n\n""It is far too rough a game for the Lady Emmelina,"" answered Princess\nPansy, shaking her head.\n\n""Then choose any game you like, only do come and play with me,"" begged\nthe Prince.  He had never had to beg so hard for anything before, for\nthe little Princess had been his willing slave as long as he could\nremember.\n\n""We cannot possibly come this afternoon,"" answered Princess Pansy.\n""The Lady Emmelina is going to have a tea-party.  I will ask her to\ninvite you if you like.""\n\nThe Prince, however, would have nothing to do with Lady Emmelina\'s\ntea-party.  He went and sat by the pond instead, and thought how fine\nhis steamboat would have looked if it had gone puffing across the water\nwith real smoke coming out of the funnel.  The mere thought of it made\nhim dislike the Lady Emmelina so much more than before that he made up\nhis mind to be revenged on her.  Now, this was an extremely bold thing\neven to think about, for she had come straight from Fairyland, and it\nis never safe to meddle with toys that have come straight from\nFairyland.  For all that, the Prince crept into the nursery that very\nsame night, when everyone in the palace was asleep, and prepared to\nhave his revenge on the waxen Lady Emmelina.  There she sat in all her\nmagnificence on the nursery table, with both her gloves tightly\nbuttoned, and both her pointed toes turned upwards.  The very sight of\nher annoyed the jealous little Prince.  He pattered across the floor on\nhis bare feet, and seized the Lady Emmelina by the arm.  She greeted\nhim with a shrill and angry shriek.\n\n""How dare you?  Let me go at once!"" she screamed.  The Prince was so\nsurprised that he dropped her on the table again.  The Lady Emmelina,\nshaking all over with fury, began smoothing out her rows of crumpled\nfrills.\n\n""The idea of such a thing!"" she gasped.  ""I declare, you have actually\npushed my crown on one side, and there is no looking-glass in the room.\nI have a great mind to report you to Fairyland.""\n\n""You may do what you like,"" answered the Prince, who was no coward and\nhad recovered from his astonishment.  ""You have bewitched the Princess\nPansy, and I mean to hide you where no one will be able to find you.""\n\nNo sooner had he uttered these words than the Lady Emmelina turned\nextremely pale.  If he had tried to melt her at the fire or to cut off\nher head with the scissors, which was the kind of thing he usually did\nto his sister\'s dolls, she knew that she would have been safe; but he\nhad threatened to do the one thing that even the fairies who protected\nher could not prevent him from doing.  Her only hope was that he would\nhide her somewhere so that she should have time to escape before\nsunrise; for after sunrise all her powers of moving or speaking would\ndesert her and she would be nothing but a wax doll again.  She need not\nhave been afraid, for the Prince did not mean to waste any more time\nthan he could help; and the next moment she was being carried swiftly\nout of the room under his arm.  Downstairs ran the little Prince, with\nhis hand over the Lady Emmelina\'s mouth to prevent her from screaming;\nand along the marble passages he hastened, until he came to a little\ndoor that led into the garden, and this he unlocked with the diamond\nkey that usually hung on the nail on the nursery wall.  It is not\npleasant to run without shoes along a gravel path, and Prince\nPerfection soon turned aside on to the lawn, and trotted over the grass\nin search of a hiding place for the Lady Emmelina.  A large white stone\nlay in the middle of the lawn and gleamed in the moonlight.  The Prince\ndid not remember having seen it there before; indeed, it was not likely\nthat the royal gardeners would have allowed it to remain in such a\nplace for a moment.  He stooped down and rolled it on one side, and\nfound that it covered a neat round hole lined with green moss.  It was\nthe very place for the Lady Emmelina; and he laid her gently in the\nvery middle of it.\n\n""I hope you will not be very cramped,"" said Prince Perfection, politely.\n\nLady Emmelina lay motionless on the mossy ground, and stared at the\nmoon.  No one would have thought that she was the same dolly who had\nscreamed so angrily in the nursery ten minutes ago.\n\n""It is the nicest place I could have found in the whole garden,""\ncontinued Prince Perfection a little anxiously.  After all, she was a\nvery beautiful doll, and she had come straight from Fairyland.\n\nStill the Lady Emmelina stared intently at the moon, with her large\nblue eyes.\n\n""I should never have thought of putting you anywhere if you had not\nbewitched the Princess,"" declared Prince Perfection, feeling still more\nuncomfortable.  It was not easy to go on apologising to some one who\npersisted in staring at the moon just as though no one was speaking to\nher.\n\n""Why did you bewitch the Princess Pansy?"" cried the little Prince.  ""If\nyou will promise not to bewitch her any more, I will take you straight\nback to the nursery.""\n\nBut although he waited eagerly for her answer, not a word came from the\nLady Emmelina; and the Prince ceased to feel sorry for her, and gave up\napologising.\n\n""It is your own fault, and I don\'t care a bit,"" he said, impatiently;\nand he rolled the large white stone over the hole, until the doll from\nFairyland was completely hidden.  It is a wonder the fairies did not\ninterfere; but perhaps they had their reasons.\n\nThere was no peace for any one in the palace when the Princess\ndiscovered that the Lady Emmelina was gone; and she discovered it\nbefore breakfast the very next morning.  It was in vain that the Prince\noffered to give her his five hundred and fifty-four birthday presents\nif she would only stop crying: the Princess wanted her doll from\nFairyland, and nothing but her doll from Fairyland would console her.\nEvery one who loved the little Princess--and that was every one in the\npalace--began looking for the Lady Emmelina; but no one succeeded in\nfinding a trace of her.  This, however, was by no means so surprising\nas it sounds, for the large white stone was no longer in the middle of\nthe lawn, and the neat round hole lined with green moss had disappeared\njust as completely.  The Prince was no less unhappy than his sister.\nNothing was turning out as he had expected; for, instead of being ready\nto play with him again, the little Princess was far too miserable to\nthink of playing at all.  He tried all day long to coax her into a good\nhumour; but bedtime came, and he had not won a single smile from her.\nIt was then that he made up his mind to go out into the world and find\nthe Lady Emmelina.  So that night the Prince once more unhooked the\ndiamond key from the nail on the nursery wall, and stole into the\ngarden in the moonlight.  This time, however, he had not forgotten to\nput on his shoes and stockings and his second-best court suit, for when\na prince goes out into the world he must at least do his best to look\nlike a prince.  When he came to the lawn he stopped and stared with\namazement; for there, in the moonlight, lay the large white stone under\nwhich he had hidden the doll from Fairyland.  Overjoyed at reaching the\nend of his journey so soon, he ran forward and rolled the stone on one\nside.  There, to be sure, was the neat round hole lined with green\nmoss; but in the middle of it sat a large grasshopper, and not a sign\nof the Lady Emmelina was to be seen.\n\nThe Prince was so disappointed that he had the greatest difficulty in\nremembering that he was ten years old, and that crying was therefore\nout of the question.  The grasshopper was winking at him as though he\nunderstood how he felt.\n\n""I guessed you would come,"" he said, in a kind voice.  ""I just waited\non purpose.""\n\n""Where has she gone?"" asked Prince Perfection, dolefully.\n\n""Ask me something easier than that,"" answered the grasshopper.  ""I\ndidn\'t see her go.  I happened to look in as I was passing; and when I\nfound she was gone I thought I\'d just wait and tell you she was gone,\ndon\'t you see?""\n\n""What is the good of waiting to tell me something I could have found\nout for myself?"" asked Prince Perfection.  ""If you can\'t help me to\nfind her, you might just as well not be there.""\n\n""I didn\'t say I couldn\'t help you to find her,"" said the grasshopper,\nlooking hurt; ""though if you are going to be cross about it I don\'t\nknow that I will.""\n\n""Oh,"" cried Prince Perfection, ""I will never be cross again, if you\nwill help me to find the Lady Emmelina.""\n\n""Then why did you hide her in the first place?"" asked the grasshopper.\nThe Prince looked foolish.\n\n""Because I had no one to play with,"" he said.\n\n""If you do find her,"" continued the grasshopper, ""do you think the\nPrincess will play with you again?""\n\n""Oh, no,"" sighed the Prince.  ""She will only want to play with the Lady\nEmmelina.""\n\n""Then don\'t try to find the Lady Emmelina,"" said the grasshopper,\npromptly.\n\n""I must,"" said Prince Perfection.  ""Anything is better than seeing the\nPrincess cry.  I took her doll away, you see, and it is my fault that\nPansy is so unhappy.  I don\'t mean to go home again until I have found\nthe Lady Emmelina.""\n\n""Right you are,"" said the grasshopper.  ""You\'re the man for me.  I\'ll\nhelp you as far as I can, but you must come down here first; I can\'t go\non shouting like this.""\n\n""Down there?"" said the Prince.  ""The hole is much too small.""\n\n""Nonsense!  Come and try,"" said the grasshopper, and indeed, before he\ntried at all, the Prince found himself inside the neat round hole, with\nthe mossy walls reaching far above his head, and the grasshopper\nshaking hands with him.\n\n""Feel all right?"" asked the grasshopper.  ""Sit down and get your\nbreath.  These sudden changes are apt to be exhausting if you are not\nused to them.""\n\n""Are you used to them?"" asked the Prince, when he had recovered enough\nbreath to speak.\n\n""Dear me, yes!"" said the grasshopper with a chuckle.  ""When I get up in\nthe morning I never know how many changes I may not have to go through\nbefore the day is over.  Don\'t think I am complaining though, for of\ncourse it is part of my profession.""\n\n""What is your profession?"" asked the Prince.\n\n""Chief Spy in Particular to the Fairy Queen,"" answered the grasshopper.\n""It\'s very hard work, I can tell you; some days I haven\'t a moment to\nmyself.  Of course, I find out a great deal that nobody else knows,\nwhich is always amusing.  Yesterday, for instance, if I hadn\'t been a\ncockchafer, a doll\'s teapot, a garden seat, a rose tree and a nursery\ntable, I shouldn\'t know as much as I do about you and the Lady\nEmmelina.""\n\n""Then please tell me what I must do in order to find the Lady\nEmmelina,"" begged the Prince.\n\n""By all means,"" said the grasshopper, cheerfully.  ""Go straight on\nwithout turning to the right or the left; and whenever some one greets\nyou, ask him politely to give you what he is thinking about, and then\nyou will be able to find the Lady Emmelina.""\n\nIt seemed rather a roundabout way of finding anything; but, as the\ngrasshopper disappeared directly he had finished speaking, there was\nnothing to do but to follow his advice.  The first part was easy\nenough, for just in front of him the Prince noticed a little door in\nthe green mossy wall, which he was quite sure had not been there\nbefore; and through this he straightway walked.  He immediately found\nhimself in a blaze of sunshine on the sea-shore, with green waves\nstretching before him as far as he could see, and nothing on either\nside of him except the flat stony beach.  ""It\'s all very well to tell\nany one to go straight on, but how am I to get across the sea?"" thought\nthe Prince.  He had never been afraid of anything in his life, however,\nso he ran down the beach and put one foot into the white foam at the\nedge.\n\n""Good-day to you!"" said a voice.  ""Who are you, and what do you want?""\n\n""I am Prince Perfection, and I want what you are thinking about,""\nanswered the Prince, boldly, although he could not see who was speaking.\n\n""That is a strange thing to want,"" said the voice; ""for I was just\nthinking about a little steamboat that would go by real steam; and how\nyou can possibly want such a thing as that is more than I can\nunderstand.""\n\nAt that moment there was a faint puffing sound in the distance, which\ncame nearer and nearer; and presently over the waves rode a most\nperfect little steamboat, with real smoke coming out of the funnel.  It\nwas just large enough for the Prince, and he stepped on board directly\nit came near enough, and put his hand on the little brass wheel.\n\n""Thank you very much,"" he said as loudly as he could, in the hope that\nthe owner of the mysterious voice would hear him.  Nobody answered him;\nbut he wondered why an old crab, who was shuffling along the beach,\nchose that particular moment to wink at him.\n\nCertainly, no one has ever reached the shore on the opposite side of\nthe sea so quickly as Prince Perfection in his real steamboat.  It was\na pleasure to hear it puff as it cut through the big green waves; and\nhe stood like a real captain with his hand on the little brass wheel,\nand steered it right into a bay that seemed waiting on purpose for it.\nIt was very sad that it should disappear directly he stepped out of it;\nbut as it had come from nowhere at all because he wanted it, he could\nnot complain because it went back to nowhere at all when he had done\nwith it.  So he sighed twice, and then walked straight ahead as before,\nup the beach and over a flat grassy plain, covered with yellow poppies\nand gorse bushes and purple heather.  Nothing could have been easier\nthan this; and Prince Perfection had not the slightest wish to turn to\nthe right or the left, until he came suddenly upon a thick clump of\ngorse bushes which lay in the very middle of his path.  He made two\nattempts to clamber over it; but, each time, he was caught in the gorse\nbushes and was scratched all over; and even if one is ten years old and\na prince, it is hard to bear being scratched all over by a gorse bush.\nPrince Perfection began to wonder if it would be very wrong to follow\nthe path to the right until he should come to an opening, but before he\nhad time to decide such a difficult question a shrill voice broke the\nsilence once more.\n\n""Good-day to you,"" it said.  ""Who are you, and what do you want?""\n\n""I am Prince Perfection, and I want what you are thinking about,""\nanswered the Prince, boldly.\n\n""How ridiculous!"" laughed the voice.  ""Why, I am thinking about a\ncannon, a real cannon that will fire real gunpowder.  Surely, you can\nwant nothing so useless as that?""\n\n""Indeed, I do,"" said the Prince; and there stood the most perfect\nlittle real cannon, loaded with real shot, and in his hand was a\nlighted match ready to fire it with.  He lost no time in pointing it\nstraight at the clump of furze bushes, and the real gunpowder made a\nflash and a splutter, and the shot went right into the middle of the\nyellow gorse and blew it all away so completely that not a trace of it\nwas left, except one small bush that the Prince had no difficulty in\njumping over.  The cannon went back to nowhere at all, just as the\nsteamboat had done.\n\n""Thank you very much,"" said the Prince Perfection as loudly as he\ncould; and again no one answered him.  He was much surprised, however,\nwhen he looked back and found that the gorse bush had disappeared as\nsoon as he had jumped over it.  After that he walked on for a long way;\nand just as he was beginning to feel tired, and the sun was beginning\nto think about setting, he tumbled right up against a big iceberg.  It\nis not usual for icebergs to drop down suddenly in the middle of the\nroad, but that is what this particular iceberg did, and that is why the\nPrince tumbled against it.\n\n""Dear me,"" sighed Prince Perfection, for even a prince\'s legs are not\nvery long when he is only ten years old, and it is not pleasant to have\nto climb an iceberg at the end of a long walk.  There was no help for\nit, however, for there was the iceberg waiting to be climbed; so the\nlittle Prince went straight at it as bravely as he could.  Any one who\nis accustomed to climbing icebergs will at once know how difficult\nPrince Perfection found it; and he tried seven times without being able\nto get up a single yard of it.\n\n""Good-day to you,"" said a voice, which sounded as though it came from\nthe very middle of the iceberg.  ""Who are you, and what do you want?""\n\n""I am so glad you have come!"" exclaimed the Prince; although, for that\nmatter, no one had come at all.  ""I am Prince Perfection, and I want\nwhat you are thinking about.""\n\n""There certainly is no accounting for tastes,"" observed the voice.  ""I\nwas just thinking about a real balloon that would take me wherever I\nwanted to go; and what use that would be to you I cannot imagine.""\n\nThe Prince did not trouble to explain what use it would be to him, for\nat that very instant the balloon floated down towards him, and he\nstepped into it as a matter of course.  It was far more beautiful than\nanything he had ever been able to imagine, however; and the movement of\nit was so delicious that he fell sound asleep the moment it began to\ncarry him upwards; and he could not keep awake long enough even to\nthank the sender of it.  When he awoke, he was lying on the grass under\na silver birch tree, and in front of him was a red brick fort with\nbattlements and a drawbridge.  It was so like the fort in which he kept\nall his tin soldiers in the nursery at home that he was not at all\nsurprised when a sentinel without a head came out in answer to his\nknock.  He remembered melting off the head of that particular tin\nsoldier only two days before, and he was much relieved when he showed\nno signs of recognising him.  As the poor tin fellow had no head, this\nwas hardly to be wondered at.\n\n""Make haste, and let down the drawbridge,"" said the Prince, banging\naway at the wooden gate with his fists; ""I want to see if the Lady\nEmmelina is inside.""\n\nHe thought he could do what he liked with his own property, but the\nsoldier without a head was evidently of another opinion.  He did not\nattempt to let down the drawbridge, and he answered the Prince in a\nrhyme which he seemed to have made up for the occasion:\n\n  ""What a ridiculous clatter\n  Over _such_ a small matter!\n  I was peacefully napping\n  When you came with your tapping;\n  You are vastly mistaken\n  If you think I\'ve forsaken\n  My official position\n  Because no physician\n  Could give me a cranium\n  Like a pot of geranium.\n  And these are my orders--\n  No one passes these borders\n  Unless he is able,\n  In song, rhyme, or fable,\n  The real, true intention\n  Of his coming to mention!""\n\n\nTo be sure, it was not much of a rhyme, but it was not bad for a\nsoldier who had no head.  When he had finished it he went away again,\nand the Prince sat down disconsolately under the silver birch tree.  He\nfelt more convinced than before that the Lady Emmelina was inside the\nfort; but although he thought as much as most people would over an\nordinary arithmetic lesson, he could not think of a single rhyme.\n\n""Good-day to you,"" said a voice that seemed to come from the very top\nof the birch tree.  ""Who are you, and what do you want?""\n\n""I am Prince Perfection, and I want what you are thinking about,""\nanswered the Prince, although he hardly hoped, this time, that he would\nget what he wanted.\n\n""Do you really mean it?"" remarked the voice.  ""I was just composing a\nsong about a charming little lady in a white silk frock, who lives\nbehind that drawbridge over there.  It is not very likely you can want\nthat!""\n\n""Hurrah!"" shouted the little Prince, standing on his head for joy.\n""Then, it is the Lady Emmelina!""\n\n""The fact is,"" continued the voice, without noticing the interruption,\n""I always make poetry when there is nothing else to do.  So does the\ntin soldier.  He can\'t help it, poor fellow, because he has lost his\nhead, you see.  If you have lost your head you cannot be expected to\nmake anything except poetry.""\n\n""Have you lost your head, too, may I ask?"" said the Prince, as politely\nas he could put such an awkward question.\n\n""For the time being I have no head to lose,"" answered the voice.  ""That\nis how I happened to be inventing a song just as you came by.  Are you\nsure there is nothing else you would like better?  A nightmare, for\ninstance, or a thunder-storm?""\n\nThe Prince was sure he would like nothing better; and the voice in the\nbirch tree sang him the following song, very softly:\n\n  ""Here I\'ve come as I was bidden\n  To seek the dolly you have hidden--\n  The dolly with the yellow hair,\n  With cheeks so pink and eyes so fair,\n  With hands that move and feet that stand--\n  The doll that came from Fairyland.\n\n  ""Do you pretend you\'ve never seen her,\n  The dainty Lady Emmelina?\n  I pray you let the drawbridge down,\n  I\'m ten years old and I can frown!\n  I mean to find her--here\'s my hand!\n  I want the doll from Fairyland.\n\n  ""The song I\'m singing--let me mention--\n  Is not a song of my invention;\n  It comes like steamboats sometimes do,\n  Like real balloons and cannons too;\n  It comes like all that\'s real and grand,\n  All the way from Fairyland!""\n\n\n""Why,"" said Prince Perfection, ""one would almost think you had made up\nthe song on purpose for me!""\n\nWhat the birch tree thought about it has never been known, for when the\nlittle Prince looked up again it had gone away to nowhere at all.\n\nThe soldier without a head let the drawbridge down, when he heard the\nsong that had come all the way from Fairyland.  The Prince did not stop\nto thank him, but hastened into the fort and looked round anxiously for\nthe Lady Emmelina.  He had very little difficulty in finding her,\nhowever, for she occupied nearly the whole of the ground floor.  She\nwas sitting up against the wall, supported on one side by an ambulance\nwaggon, and on the other by a camp-fire which, strange to say, had not\neven singed her elegant fan, although it burned with the brightest of\nred and yellow flames.\n\n""There you are!  Will you come home with me?"" said the Prince, rather\nnervously; for he was not much bigger than she was, now, and he was a\nlittle afraid lest she should have unpleasant recollections of the neat\nround hole lined with green moss.  To his relief, she seemed quite glad\nto see him.\n\n""To be sure I will,"" said the Lady Emmelina.  ""I should not be fit to\nbe seen if I stayed much longer in this dusty old place!""\n\nSo they went home together, and of course that did not take them long,\nfor the way home is always the shortest way in the world.  To begin\nwith, the balloon was waiting for them as they came out of the fort;\nand it carried them all the way to the sea-shore before they had time\nto notice that they were in a balloon at all.  When they reached the\nsea-shore they found that the steamboat was waiting for them, too; and\nthe steamboat landed them on the opposite side of the sea even before\nthey knew that they had stepped out of the balloon; and after that the\nPrince never knew what did happen, for the next thing he noticed was\nthat he had grown to his proper size again, and was standing once more\nin the royal nursery with the Lady Emmelina tucked under his arm.\nThere at the table in the middle of the room sat the little Princess\nPansy, and in front of her was a large bowl of bread and milk.\n\n""Oh!  Oh!  You have come back at last!"" cried the Princess, jumping\ndown from her chair.  ""I am so glad, I am so glad!""\n\n""I thought you would be glad to see her again,"" said Prince Perfection,\nand he handed her the doll from Fairyland.\n\n""I didn\'t mean _that_!"" exclaimed the little Princess.  And then, sad\nas it is to relate, they both forgot all about the Lady Emmelina; and\nthe next minute, she found herself lying face downwards on the floor,\nwhile the Prince and Princess hugged each other.  And it was of no use\nfor the royal nurses to talk about bread and milk, for not a thing\nwould the two children touch until they had talked as much as they\nwanted.\n\n""You will not cry any more, now that you have the Lady Emmelina to play\nwith, will you?"" said Prince Perfection, who, strange to say, did not\nfeel in the least bit jealous of the Lady Emmelina as long as she lay\nface downwards on the floor.\n\n""I don\'t think I want to play with the Lady Emmelina much,"" answered\nPrincess Pansy.  ""I think I would rather play with you.  It has been so\ndull while you have been away.""  For, although the Prince did not know\nit, he had been away for a whole month.\n\n""I am delighted to hear it,"" cried the little Prince.  ""Let us play at\nRoyal Executioner, and _you_ shall be executioner.""\n\n""Oh, no,"" said the little Princess.  ""I would _much_ sooner be\nexecuted.""\n\nAs they disputed the point politely, the grasshopper suddenly jumped in\nat the window and nodded at them.\n\n""Good-day to you,"" he said.  ""I was just thinking at that moment about\na steamboat and a cannon and a real balloon.  Strange, wasn\'t it?""\n\nImmediately the Prince found a steamboat in his right hand and a cannon\nin his left; while outside the window floated a charming balloon, just\nlarge enough for himself and Princess Pansy.\n\n""Wait a minute,"" cried the Prince, as the grasshopper jumped on to the\nwindow-sill again.  ""I want to tell you all about--""\n\n""No need to do that,"" chuckled the grasshopper.  ""You don\'t suppose\nI\'ve been a crab and a gorse bush and an iceberg and a silver birch\ntree for nothing, do you?""\n\nThat time he really hopped away to nowhere at all, and the children\nhave never seen him since.  This does not matter in the least, however,\nfor they are not likely to want his help again; the Lady Emmelina is\nalways kept in her proper place now, and the Princess is no longer\nbewitched by her.  It is only reasonable to suppose that the Fairy\nZigzag had something to do with the change in the Lady Emmelina, but\nthe Fairy Zigzag says that she never troubled herself about it at all.\nHowever that may be, the children have never had an unhappy moment\nsince Prince Perfection went out into the world to find the doll that\ncame straight from Fairyland.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: ""WILL YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME, LITTLE WISDOM?""]\n\n\n\n\nTHOSE WYMPS AGAIN\n\nThere was great consternation in Fairyland, for it was suddenly\ndiscovered that the sun had been shining crookedly all the morning.  It\nwas consequently two hours later than anybody thought it was; and this,\nas it happened, was a very serious matter, for all the fairies had been\ninvited to the christening of the little Prince Charming, and it would\nnever do for them to arrive late.  Of course, the wymps were at the\nbottom of it and the sun had no idea that he was not shining quite in\nhis usual way; but no one in Fairyland had time to trouble about that,\nand, without waiting even for the butterflies to be harnessed, away\nflew all the fairies in a regular scurry.  Now, even fairies are apt to\ndo stupid things sometimes, especially when they are flustered and the\nwymps have been at work; so there may be some excuse for what they did\non that particular morning.  The fact is, they were so anxious to\narrive in time to give their christening presents to the royal baby,\nthat when they met a christening party coming along the road they never\nstopped to see whether it was the right christening party or not, but\njust flew down and presented their gifts to the baby, one after\nanother, as fast as they could speak.\n\n""I give you beauty,"" said one.  ""And I, thoughtfulness,"" said another.\n""And I, wisdom,"" said a third.  ""And I, patience,"" said a fourth.  ""And\nI, contentment,"" said a fifth; and so on, until all the gifts of\nFairyland had been given to the baby in the nurse\'s arms.  Then, when\nthey had quite finished speaking, the poor, flurried little fairies\ndiscovered that the baby was the daughter of a poor peasant and his\nwife, while Prince Charming lived in quite another country, a very long\nway off.  It was a great calamity, no doubt, but nothing could be done,\nfor the fairies had no more gifts left; so they returned very sadly to\nFairyland, and hoped that the wymps would not find it out.  Of course,\nthe wymps did find it out, for they had arranged the whole thing from\nthe very beginning.  Still, the wymps are not nearly so bad as they\npretend to be; and when they had finished laughing over their joke they\ndid their best to make things right again by going in large numbers to\nPrince Charming\'s christening.  They behaved very noisily when they got\nthere; and they ate every bit of the christening cake and ended in\ngiving the baby Prince the only nice gift the wymps have the power to\ngive; and that is the nicest gift in the world, for it is called\nLaughter.  To be sure, there had never been such a topsy-turvey\nchristening party before; but all the guests enjoyed it thoroughly, and\nthat cannot be said of all the parties to which the fairies are\ninvited.  The Fairy Queen could not help smiling when she heard what\nhappened.  ""Never mind!"" she said.  ""Some day, Prince Charming shall\nhave all the gifts of Fairyland, too.  Meanwhile, he has something far\nbetter than we should have given him.""\n\nThe peasant\'s daughter grew up as beautiful and as wise as all the\ngifts of Fairyland could make her.  Everything she did was as well done\nas the cleverest people in the world, all put together, could have done\nit; and everything she said was as wise as the contents of all the\nbooks in the King\'s library.  When she cooked the Sunday dinner, she\nmade it taste like a banquet of twenty courses; she had only to look at\nthe flowers in the garden, and they bloomed as luxuriantly as though\nthey had been brought straight from Fairyland.  She helped all the\nvillage people when they were in a difficulty, for her advice was the\nvery best that could be had; and they soon forgot that she was only a\nchild, and they called her ""Little Wisdom"" instead of the ordinary name\nby which she had been christened.  She loved to sit by herself in the\ncherry orchard, and she wondered how the other children could laugh and\nplay when there was so much thinking to be done.  She never laughed nor\nplayed herself, for the fairies had been so anxious to make her wise\nand beautiful, that they had not thought of giving her anything so\nordinary as happiness.  Every one envied her parents for having such a\nwonderful daughter; but for all that the peasant and his wife were not\nsatisfied.\n\n""It is a great pity,"" grumbled her father, ""that all the gifts of\nFairyland should have been wasted on a girl.  If the child had been a\nboy, now, she would have made some stir in the world.""\n\n""For my part,"" sighed her mother, ""I would gladly see her lose all the\ngifts of Fairyland if she would only laugh and cry like other children.""\n\nIn the meantime the little Prince Charming was growing up without the\nhelp of a single gift from Fairyland.  Never had the palace contained\nsuch an idle, careless little Prince; he laughed at everything that\nhappened, morning, noon, and night; he played tricks on all his\nProfessors instead of learning his lessons, and he could not keep grave\nlong enough even to say the alphabet.  He was so determined to look on\nthe bright side of everything, that when people were angry with him he\nthought it was only their way of being amusing; and when they tried to\npunish him, he found it such a good joke that they very soon gave up\nthe attempt.  The people, one and all, loved the merry little Prince\nwho laughed at life from his royal nursery and refused to grow any\nolder; but the King viewed the matter in quite another light.\n\n""What will become of the country,"" said his Majesty, ""if the boy does\nnot learn to be serious?""\n\n""He is so happy,"" said the Queen, apologetically.  ""Is not that enough?""\n\nThe King evidently thought it was not nearly enough, for he despatched\na page at once to fetch Prince Charming from the nursery.  The Prince\ncame whistling into the room, with his hands in his pockets, which was\nnot a princely way of behaving, to begin with.\n\n""You are eleven years old,"" began the King, solemnly.\n\n""Everybody tells me that,"" said the Prince, smiling gaily.  He supposed\ngrown-up people could not help saying the same thing so often; at all\nevents he did not mean to let it trouble him.\n\n""It is time you learned to be serious,"" continued the King, still more\nsolemnly.\n\n""To be serious?  What is that?  Is it a new game?"" asked Prince\nCharming, eagerly.\n\n""Hush!"" whispered the Queen, anxiously.  ""It is what every one has to\nbe,--the Prime Minister, and the Head Cook, and everybody.""\n\n""Surely,"" laughed the little Prince, ""if so many people are occupied in\nbeing serious there is no need for me to bother about it!""\n\n""You cannot even read,"" said the King, frowning.\n\n""No; but my Professor can,"" said Prince Charming.  ""He can read the\nlongest words in the dictionary without taking breath.  When any one in\nthe kingdom can read so beautifully as that, it would surely be\nimpolite to try to imitate him!""\n\n""The poorest children in the kingdom know far more than you do,"" said\nthe King, who was rapidly losing patience.\n\n""Then there are plenty of people to tell me everything I want to know,""\nsmiled the Prince.  ""What is the use of knowing just as much as\neverybody else?  There would be nothing left to talk about.""\n\nThe King looked at the Queen in despair.\n\n""It is not the boy\'s fault,"" said the Queen soothingly; ""you see, the\nfairies did not come to his christening.""\n\n""And the wymps did,"" sighed the King.  ""I suppose that is why we have a\nstupid son without an idea in his head.""\n\nPrince Charming took off his crown and felt his head very carefully.\n\n""What is an idea?"" he asked.  ""And why have I no idea in my head?  Have\nyou got one in your head, father?""\n\nThe King was so angry at being asked whether he had an idea in his\nhead, that he sent Prince Charming straight back to the nursery.\nHowever, as that was where the Prince liked best to be, he laughed more\nthan ever and was not in the least bit ashamed of himself.\n\nNow, Prince Charming was known to be so light-hearted and so careless,\nthat all the flowers and all the animals told him their secrets; for it\nis always safe to tell a secret to some one who is not taken seriously\nby other people.  And the Prince, for his part, delighted in talking to\nthe flowers and the animals, because they never reminded him that he\nwas eleven years old, nor told him to stop laughing as all the other\npeople did, the people who were too clever to worry their heads about\nflowers and animals at all.  So the Prince soon jumped out of the\nnursery window into his own little garden, where his name was written\nseveral times in mustard and cress, and where the tiger lilies fought\nwith the scarlet poppies because they had been planted one on the top\nof the other, and where the guinea-pigs and the rabbits and the white\nmice ran wild and did what they liked.  He took a very large\nwatering-can and watered himself and a very small rose tree for the\nthird time since sunrise, and then sat down and looked at the mould on\nhis fingers.\n\n""How funny everything is,"" said Prince Charming, laughing heartily.  ""I\nhave done nothing but water my rose tree, and yet all my fingers are\ncovered with mould!  Now, the Prime Minister might water fifty rose\ntrees and he would never get a speck of mould even on his shoe buckles.\nI suppose it is because the Prime Minister has learnt to be serious.\nOh dear!  I do wish I had an idea in my head!""\n\n""What are you saying?"" asked the rose tree, shaking off the effects of\nthe Prince\'s overwhelming attentions.  ""Why do you wish to have an idea\nin your head?""\n\n""Just to see what it would feel like,"" answered the Prince.  ""I don\'t\neven know what an idea is.  Do you?""\n\n""An idea,"" replied the rose tree in a superior tone, ""is what somebody\nremembers to have heard somebody else say.""\n\n""I shall never have an idea, then,"" said Prince Charming; ""for I never\nremember what anybody says.  Is there no other way of getting an idea?""\n\n""To be sure there is,"" answered the rose tree; ""but very few people\nknow of it.  You can go to the Red Rock Goblin, if you like, and get a\nwhole new idea for yourself.  He has quantities of ideas, piled up in\nheaps; but very few people succeed in getting one.""\n\n""I shall never succeed, then,"" said the Prince; ""for I am the stupidest\nboy in the world.""\n\n""That doesn\'t matter,"" said the rose tree.  ""The Red Rock Goblin does\nnot care much about clever people, I fancy.  Go and try.""\n\n""I think I will,"" said the Prince.  ""It is sure to be amusing, at all\nevents.  What must I do to get there?""\n\n""It is of no use to do anything,"" answered the rose tree.  ""If you are\nthe right sort of boy you will find yourself there, that\'s all.""\n\nEvidently, Prince Charming was the right sort of boy; for as he looked\nat the rose tree, it grew larger and larger, and redder and redder,\nuntil it was no longer a rose tree at all, but just a large, square,\nred rock.  The little Prince was so amused at the transformation that\nhe burst out laughing; and when he looked round and found that the\ngarden and the palace had disappeared too, and that he was standing in\nthe middle of nothing at all, he laughed even more than before at the\nabsurdity of it all.\n\n""Hullo!"" said a voice from inside the square red rock.  ""What are you\nlaughing at?""\n\n""I am laughing at everything,"" said the little Prince.  ""I always laugh\nat everything; but that may be because I haven\'t an idea in my head.""\n\n""I am glad to hear that,"" said the voice.  ""Most of the people who come\nhere have so many ideas of their own that I take good care not to let\nthem steal one of mine.  However, step inside, and you shall have one\nof my very best ideas.""\n\nThe Prince could hardly be said to have accepted this invitation, for\nhe had no time to move before he found himself transported to the\ninterior of the rock; and there he stood in the middle of a large,\nsquare room, that hung dimly lighted by a red lantern from the roof.\nThe Red Rock Goblin sat facing him, at a little round table.  He had a\nbushy red beard that trailed on the ground, and in his mouth was a long\npipe from which rings of red smoke slowly curled up towards the roof.\n\n""Do you feel afraid?"" asked the Goblin, blowing a particularly long\nthin line of red smoke into the air, which curled round and round the\nlittle Prince until he could hardly breathe.  He could still laugh,\nhowever; and directly he did that, the red smoke cleared away again and\nraced up to the roof, as though it were frightened at the very sound of\nthe Prince\'s laugh.\n\n""I\'m not at all afraid, thank you,"" said Prince Charming.  ""My\nProfessor says that I am far too stupid to understand the meaning of\nfear.  Besides, what is there to be afraid of?""\n\nThe Red Rock Goblin waved his long, red, bony hand towards the shelves\nthat covered the four walls.\n\n""Those shelves are packed with new ideas,"" he said.  ""Most people are\nafraid of new ideas.""\n\n""How stupid of them!"" said the Prince, beginning to whistle.  ""A new\nidea must be more amusing to play with than an old one, I should think!""\n\n""Of course it is,"" answered the Goblin.  ""That is what new ideas are\nfor.  However, as you don\'t seem afraid, I will find you a new idea to\nplay with.""\n\nHe put his pipe on the table, and fetched a pair of steps, and climbed\nup to the highest shelf of all.  When he came down again, he held a\nsmall bottle in his hand, which he uncorked; and from this he poured\nsomething into a red metal bowl on the table.  Immediately a delightful\nsmell of pine woods and strawberry jam and sea-air and hot cakes and\nchrysanthemums filled the air; and the Prince drank it in and laughed\nwith pleasure.\n\n""Ah!"" he cried suddenly, putting his hand to his head, as the contents\nof the bottle fizzed and bubbled in the red metal bowl and the smell of\npine woods and all the other things grew stronger.  ""So it is all\nbecause the sun shone crookedly on my christening day!""\n\n""Just so,"" answered the Red Rock Goblin, looking intently into the red\nmetal bowl.  ""That is why all the gifts of Fairyland, which ought to\nhave been yours, were given to Little Wisdom.  Now, if you were to go\nstraight off and find Little Wisdom--""\n\n""That\'s not a bad idea!"" shouted the Prince.\n\n""Of course it isn\'t,"" snapped the Goblin, drawing himself up\nindignantly.  ""It is a very good idea; one of the best I have ever\nmade.  If you want a _bad_ idea, you had better go somewhere else for\nit.""\n\nThere was nothing for it but to apologise, and this the Prince did as\npolitely as he could, saying that if he had been a little more\naccustomed to receiving ideas he would have known better how to behave\nto this one.  He then asked the Goblin to tell him the way to Little\nWisdom\'s home, but the Goblin answered him just as the rose tree had\ndone.\n\n""There isn\'t a way,"" he said.  ""If you are the right sort of boy you\nwill find yourself there, that\'s all.""\n\nThere was again no doubt whatever that Prince Charming was the right\nsort of boy, for the walls of the square red rock fell down as flat as\nthe walls of a card house, and he found himself walking in a beautiful\ncherry orchard, with bright green grass under his feet and showers of\nwhite blossoms falling softly from above, with a blue and grey sky\noverhead, and the sound of bees in the air.  Under the largest cherry\ntree sat a solemn little girl in a stiff white frock, with a large red\nsunshade spread over her.  The Prince looked at her doubtfully.  If she\nhad been an ordinary little girl in a pinafore, with a laugh in her\nvoice, he would have asked her to play with him at once; but it was\nimpossible to be as friendly as that with a little girl in a stiff\nwhite frock.  What he finally did was what he always did when he was in\na difficulty--he began to laugh.  The little girl only stared at him\nmore solemnly than before; and for the first time in his life Prince\nCharming felt that laughing was a little out of place.\n\n""Will you come and play with me, Little Wisdom?"" he said, taking off\nhis crown and making her his best court bow.\n\n""I never play,"" answered the little girl, who possessed all the gifts\nof Fairyland.\n\n""That is a pity,"" observed the Prince, ""for it is the only thing worth\ndoing.  What do you do all day if you don\'t play?""\n\n""I think,"" answered Little Wisdom, gravely.  ""I think about everything\nin the world; and when I have come to the end I begin all over again.""\n\n""How queer!"" said the Prince.  ""I have never thought about anything in\nmy whole life.  It is much better to laugh.""\n\n""Is it?"" asked Little Wisdom, and she smoothed out the folds of her\nstiff white frock thoughtfully.  After thinking all day long for eleven\nyears it seemed as though it might make a change to learn to laugh.\n\n""Do you know,"" continued the Prince, ""that you have all the gifts of\nFairyland?  That is why I am the stupidest boy in the world.""\n\n""I know,"" said Little Wisdom without seeming at all surprised, which\nwas, of course, only natural, for when one knows everything in the\nworld there is nothing left to be surprised at.\n\n""If the sun had shone straight on my christening day,"" said Prince\nCharming, ""I should have had all the gifts of Fairyland instead of you.""\n\n""I know,"" said Little Wisdom again.  It seemed to her very unnecessary\nto talk so much about things that she had always known without being\ntold.\n\n""And if I had all the gifts of Fairyland instead of you, I should have\nlearnt to be serious,"" continued Prince Charming.\n\n""Perhaps you would,"" said Little Wisdom.  She was beginning to wonder\nif all stupid boys were as nice as this little Prince, who seemed to\ntake it for granted that she wanted to go on talking to him.\n\n""Of course,"" continued Prince Charming, ""I should not think of\ndepriving you of any of the gifts from Fairyland; but if you will come\nback to the palace with me and teach me how to be serious I will give\nyou the wymps\' gift in exchange.  It is not a very nice present,\nperhaps,"" he added humbly, ""because it makes everybody complain of you\nso much; but it is the only gift I have to offer you.""\n\n""And what is the wymps\' gift?"" asked Little Wisdom.  She was quite\ninterested now, for here at last was something that she did not know.\nThe Prince answered her with a peal of laughter; and Little Wisdom\nbegan to feel decidedly odd.  First of all, she felt a curious tickling\nsomewhere at the back of her head, and then a widening out of the\nthinking lines on her forehead, and then a twitching sensation round\nthe corners of her mouth, and then--but it is not difficult to guess\nwhat happened next.  It takes all the fairies in Fairyland to make a\nlittle girl wise when she is only eleven years old; but even a stupid\nlittle Prince without an idea in his head can teach her to laugh!\n\nNow, when the peasant and his wife heard their daughter laughing in the\ncherry orchard, they came hurrying out to see what could be the cause\nof such a wonderful event.  All the people in the village came running\ntoo--men and women, boys and girls, one on the top of the other; and\nthey stood round in a ring and stared, while the merry little Prince\nand the wise little girl in the stiff white frock laughed at nothing at\nall.\n\n""What is the meaning of it all?"" asked the good people.  ""Is it the\nfairies\' doing?""\n\n""Nothing of the sort,"" answered the Prince, again taking off his crown\nand making them all his best court bow.  ""It is only because the sun\nshone crookedly on my christening day.  That is why I have come to\nfetch Little Wisdom.  I really hope you have no objection?""\n\nHe said this so very charmingly that everybody felt it would be most\nimpolite to object; besides, Little Wisdom had taken the Prince\'s hand\nand seemed to have settled the question already.  As for her parents,\nthey were overjoyed at the idea.\n\n""After all,"" said her father, ""the child will make some stir in the\nworld.""  His wife laughed and cried at the same moment.\n\n""We shall lose Little Wisdom,"" she said; ""but, at least, she will learn\nto be like other children.""\n\nPrince Charming was as usual in a great hurry, for he could never\nendure to wait for anything except his lessons; so he turned to the\nnearest cherry tree and asked it to tell him the way home.\n\n""If you don\'t know the way home without being told, you are not at all\nthe right sort of boy,"" answered the cherry tree.  Of course, as we\nknow already, Prince Charming was the right sort of boy; and the very\nnext minute he marched once more into the royal palace, and by his side\ntripped a sedate little girl in a stiff white frock.\n\n""I have found Little Wisdom,"" he announced to his parents and the court\nin general, as they sat over their afternoon tea.  ""She is going to\nstay here and play with me for ever and ever.  Isn\'t it fun?""\n\n""The boy will never be serious,"" sighed the King, although he looked\nwith approval at the solemn face of the little girl in the stiff white\nfrock.\n\n""I will teach him to be serious,"" said Little Wisdom, ""because he has\nalready taught me how to laugh.""\n\nBut she never did teach him to be serious, for Prince Charming did\nnothing but laugh to the end of his days.  This did not, however,\nmatter quite so much as might be supposed, for when one plays all day\nlong with some one who knows everything there is to know, one need not\nbe so very wise oneself.  And when the time came for Prince Charming to\nrule the country, the Queen who sat beside him on the throne was a wise\nand beautiful maiden in a stiff white frock.  So the Prince laughed as\nmuch as before, and the country was governed with all the wisdom of the\nfairies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Transcriber\'s note: the HTML version of this ebook contains scans of\nthe publisher\'s 10-page catalogue of children\'s books.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s All the Way to Fairyland, by Evelyn Sharp\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALL THE WAY TO FAIRYLAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30400.txt or 30400.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/0/30400/\n\nProduced by Al Haines\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'}","{'text': ""When does Martin say he'll have a toy for the King's daughter?"", 'tokens': array(['When', 'does', 'Martin', 'say', 'he', 'll', 'have', 'a', 'toy',
